Numerous anthropometric-based predictive equations are available for body composition assessments; furthermore, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) estimates are available. However, in older adults, the validity of body fat estimates requires further investigation. Objective: To assess the agreement between percentage body fat (BF%) estimates by BIA and five predictive equations based on anthropometric characteristics using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference method. A secondary objective was to identify whether excluding short-stature women improves the agreement of BF% estimates in a group of community-dwelling, older Mexican women. Methods: A concordance analysis of BF% was performed. A total of 121 older women participated in the study. Anthropometric information, BIA, and DXA body composition estimates were obtained. Five equations using anthropometric data were evaluated in order to determine body fat percentage (BF%) using DXA as reference method. Paired t-test comparisons and standard error of estimates (SEE) were obtained. The Bland-Altman plot with 95% limits of agreement and the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) were used to evaluate the BF% prediction equations and BIA estimates. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 73.7 (±5.8) years old. BIA and the anthropometric based equations examined showed mean significant differences when tested in the entire sample. For the taller women (height > 145 cm), no significant difference in the paired comparison was found between DXA and BIA of BF% estimates. The mean BF% was 40.3 (±4.8) and 40.7 (±6.2) for DXA and BIA, respectively. The concordance between methods was good (CCC 0.814), (SEE 2.62). Also, in the taller women subset, the Woolcott equation using waist-to-height ratio presented no significant difference in the paired comparison; however, the error of the estimates was high (SEE 3.37) and the concordance was moderate (CCC 0.693). Conclusion: This study found that BIA yielded good results in the estimation of BF% among women with heights over 145 cm. Also, in this group, the Woolcott predictive equation based on waist circumference and height ratio showed no significant differences compared to DXA in the paired comparison; however, the large error of estimates observed may limit its application. In older women, short stature may impact the validity of the body fat percentage estimates of anthropometric-based predictive equations.";aging | anthropometric | bioelectrical impedance | body fat | DXA (dual X-ray absorptiometry) | validation studies;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Infrared thermography is a non-invasive tool that uses the radiation emitted from the skin of animals to assess their thermal state. However, there are no established thermal windows in wildlife species because factors such as the thickness or color of the skin, type/length of coat, or presence of fur can influence the readings taken to obtain objective, sensitive values. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the usefulness and application of the ocular, nasal, thoracic, abdominal, and podal anatomical regions as thermal windows for evaluating zoo animals’ thermal response and health status. A literature search of the Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed databases was performed to identify relevant studies that used IRT with wild species as a complementary diagnostic tool. Implementing IRT in zoos or conservation centers could also serve as a method for determining and monitoring optimal habitat designs to meet the needs of specific animals. In addition, we analyze the limitations of using IRT with various wildlife species under human care to understand better the differences among animals and the factors that must be considered when using infrared thermography.;infrared thermography | pain | thermal status | thermal window;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In this work, Bacillus subtilis was cultivated in a bioreactor to produce IAA using propionate and glucose as carbon sources in an M9-modified media; in both cases, tryptophan was added as a co-substrate. The yield of IAA using propionate is 17% higher compared to glucose. After 48 h of cultivation, the final concentration was 310 mg IAA/L using propionate and 230 mg IAA/L using glucose, with a concentration of 500 mg Trp/L. To gain more insight into propionate metabolism and its advantages, the genome-scale metabolic model of B. subtilis (iBSU 1147) and computational analysis were used to calculate flux distribution and evaluate the metabolic capabilities to produce IAA using propionate. The metabolic fluxes demonstrate that propionate uptake favors the production of precursors needed for the synthesis of the hormone, and the sensitivity analysis shows that the control of a specific growth rate has a positive impact on the production of IAA.";3-indole acetic acid | Bacillus subtilis | flux balance analysis | propionate metabolism;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;A1-S-30750;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The heat interchange through the superficial temperature of animals can be evaluated with infrared thermography (IRT). However, to date, there is no information on thermal windows in puppies. This study aimed to evaluate, with the use of IRT, the microcirculatory alterations in 8 different thermal windows identified at 7 different times in 289 newborn puppies assigned to different groups. Three thermograms were taken from four zones of each puppy: the facial, frontal, right lateral, and left lateral regions. Newborn puppies were grouped in 4 quartiles according to their weight: Q1 (126–226 g) n = 73, Q2 (227–330 g) n = 72, Q3 (331–387 g) n = 74, and Q4 (388–452 g) n = 70. A total of 8 thermal windows were considered at 7 evaluation times from Wet at birth until 24 h after birth (AB). Two-way mixed ANOVA within and between subjects’ design for each thermal window (eight models) was performed. Results revealed a positive correlation between the puppy’s weight and its ability to achieve thermostability in all the evaluated thermal windows. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.0001) between the 4 quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) were found. The lowest temperatures were recorded when the pups were still wet and the highest at 24 h AB. Thermal windows with the highest temperatures were abdominal (34.234 ± 0.056 °C), thoracic (33.705 ± 0.049 °C), nasal (30.671 ± 0.110 °C), and upper left palpebral (34.066 ± 0.052 °C), while the lowest were thoracic limb brachial biceps (27.534 ± 0.051 °C), thoracic limb elbow (27.141 ± 0.049 °C), thoracic limb metacarpal (27.024 ± 0.062 °C), and femoral pelvic limb (27.654 ± 0.055 °C).

Knowing the thermal windows to evaluate and maintain a constant temperature helps significantly reduce neonatal mortality. This study aimed to assess the superficial temperature alterations in the distinct thermal windows of puppies with mothers of diverse weights and their repercussions. We evaluated the superficial temperature using infrared thermography at eight thermal windows and seven different times: when wet due to the fetal fluid immediately after birth until 24 h of life in newborn puppies from bitches divided into four bodyweight groups. The results revealed a positive correlation between the dam’s weight and the ability to achieve thermostability in the newborn puppies in all the evaluated thermal windows. The time effect showed the lowest temperatures when the puppies were still wet, a gradual increase, and the highest temperature at 24 h after birth. The thermal windows with the highest temperatures were abdominal, thoracic, nasal, and upper left palpebral, and those with the lowest were the thoracic limb brachial biceps, thoracic limb elbow, metacarpal, and femoral pelvic limb. A significant increase in the temperatures in the thermal windows of the abdominal, thoracic, and upper left palpebral immediately after ingesting colostrum was observed. The weight of the dams is an important factor that positively intervenes in the thermoregulatory capacity of the puppies, especially when newborns are dry and have been passed 24 h after birth.;animal perinatology | dogs | newborn puppy | puppy welfare | thermographic image | whelping;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Precise HIV burden information is critical for effective geographic and epidemiological targeting of prevention and treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence estimates are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at local scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults ages 15–59 years across SSA. Methods: We analyzed data from 91 seroprevalence surveys and sentinel surveillance among antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendees using model-based geostatistical methods to produce estimates of HIV prevalence across 43 countries in SSA, from years 2000 to 2018, at a 5 × 5-km resolution and presented among second administrative level (typically districts or counties) units. Results: We found substantial variation in HIV prevalence across localities, ages, and sexes that have been masked in earlier analyses. Within-country variation in prevalence in 2018 was a median 3.5 times greater across ages and sexes, compared to for all adults combined. We note large within-district prevalence differences between age groups: for men, 50% of districts displayed at least a 14-fold difference between age groups with the highest and lowest prevalence, and at least a 9-fold difference for women. Prevalence trends also varied over time; between 2000 and 2018, 70% of all districts saw a reduction in prevalence greater than five percentage points in at least one sex and age group. Meanwhile, over 30% of all districts saw at least a five percentage point prevalence increase in one or more sex and age group. Conclusions: As the HIV epidemic persists and evolves in SSA, geographic and demographic shifts in prevention and treatment efforts are necessary. These estimates offer epidemiologically informative detail to better guide more targeted interventions, vital for combating HIV in SSA.";Africa | Demographics | Geostatistics | HIV | HIV prevalence | Mapping | Spatial statistics;0;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;332821690;National Institutes of Health

Interest in improving animal welfare and porcine productivity has led to the development of various lines of research that seek to understand the effect of certain environmental conditions on productivity and the impact of implementing strategies designed to mitigate adverse effects. The non-invasive infrared thermography technique is one of the tools most widely used to carry out these studies, based on detecting changes in microcirculation. However, evaluations using this tool require reliable thermal windows; this can be challenging because several factors can affect the sensitivity and specificity of the regions selected. This review discusses the thermal windows used with domestic pigs and the association of thermal changes in these regions with the thermoregulatory capacity of piglets and hogs.";heat stress | hog | hypothermia | infrared thermography | piglet;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

This condition has been described in animal species such as canids, sheep, cattle, horses, pigs, and marine mammals. In its pathogenesis, the pulmonary epithelium activates a limited inflammatory response initiated by cytokines causing leukocyte chemotaxis, inhibition of phagocytosis, and pathogen destruction. Likewise, cytokines release participates in the apoptosis processes of pneumocytes due to the interaction of angiotensin with cytokines and the caspase pathway. Due to these reactions, the prevalent signs are lung injury, hypoxia, acidosis, and pneumonia with susceptibility to infection. Given the importance of the pathophysiological mechanism of meconium aspiration syndrome, this review aims to discuss the relevance of the syndrome in veterinary medicine. The inflammatory processes caused by meconium aspiration in animal models will be analyzed, and the cellular apoptosis and biochemical processes of pulmonary surfactant inactivation will be discussed.;animal models | apoptosis | meconium | pulmonary inflammatory response | surfactant inactivation;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

It also explored risk factors such as season, breed, age and sex in the states of Puebla and Veracruz, Mexico. A total of 5281 cattle livers were inspected in two abattoirs. The overall prevalence of the parasite in cattle throughout 2020 was 24.9% (1313 out of 5281). The highest prevalence was found in Veracruz (28.5%; tropical climate), followed by Puebla (18.4%; temperate climate). The prevalence of fluke infection during the wet season was 19.0% and 25.8% in the states of Puebla and Veracruz, respectively; during the dry season, this was 18.0% and 30.2% respectively. The annual loss caused by condemnation of the liver for both abattoirs was estimated to be US$7502. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, two models were constructed for potential association with the prevalence of condemned livers, using season, breed, age and sex as risk factors. The results indicate that season, age and sex were signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of parasitic infection. Cattle age was the variable most strongly associated with F. hepatica infection, with the highest prevalence in cattle over three years of age as compared to younger animals, both in the states of Veracruz with a tropical climate (OR 6.443; 95% CI: 4.487–9.251) and in Puebla with a temperate climate (OR 2.854; 95% CI: 1.531–5.321). The results indicate that diﬀerent factors were signiﬁcantly associated with the prevalence of condemned livers, and it highlights the importance of continuous monitoring programmes for F. hepatica infection and preventing economic losses in cattle production.";Abattoirs | Cattle | Economic loss | Fasciola hepatica | Liver condemnation | Prevalence;0;0;;;BUAP;VIEP-VIMA-NAT-21-I;Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla

Methods: A two-stage project consisting of a diagnostic scale construction (n1 = 9 for interviews, n2 = 9 for cognitive laboratory) and a validation study with a cross-sectional sample (N = 570) was carried out. Both semi-structured interviews and a cognitive laboratory with nine participants were conducted to obtain DEBM-Q items. DEBM-Q was applied to 570 freshmen male in Mexico City. Psychometric characteristics and internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) were analyzed. An item-total correlation value greater than 0.30 was determined, and factor loads greater than 0.40 were considered valid. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA, n1 = 297) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA, n2 = 273) were performed. Results: Two fixed factors explaining 55.08% of the total variance were extracted. Factor 1, “Drive for Thinness” (8 items), explained 30.84% of the variance, whereas factor 2, “Drive for Muscularity” (8 items), explained 24.23% of the variance. Cronbach’s alpha for the whole questionnaire was 0.84. DEBM-Q was correlated with the Dutch Food Restriction Scale (RS) (r = 0.52, p < 0.001), Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) (r = 0.46, p < 0.001), Emotional Eating Scale (EES) (r = 0.18, p < 0.001), and Negative Affect Subscale (PANAS-X) (r = 0.11, p < 0.005). Conclusion: DEBM-Q is a valid and practical short screening tool (16 items) allowing early identification of disordered eating in young men, thereby facilitating clinical management.

Therefore, we assessed the 1-year incidence of STB among first-year students, a broad range of prospective predictors of STB incidence, and evaluated the prediction accuracy of a baseline multivariate risk prediction model to identify students at highest risk for STB onset over the subsequent 12 months. Methods: Students (n = 3238) from 13 universities in Mexico completed an online survey developed for the World Mental Health International College Student Surveys in their first year and again 12 months after. We ran generalized linear models and receiver operator curves. Results: The 1-year incidence of suicidal ideation, plan and attempt was 8.53%, 3.75%, and 1.16%, respectively. Predictors in final models were female sex (ideation only), minority sexual orientation (ideation only), depression, eating disorders, ADHD (ideation and plan), ongoing arguments or breakup with a romantic partner (ideation only), emotional abuse (ideation only), parental death (ideation, plan), not Catholic/Christian (ideation, plan), not having someone to rely on, psychotic experiences (plan only), and insufficient sleep (attempt only). Prediction accuracy for ideation, plan and attempt was area under the curve = 0.76, 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. Targeting the top 10% of students at highest risk could reduce STB in the subsequent year up to 36%. Conclusions: By assessing these risk/protective factors in incoming students we identified students at greatest risk for developing STB to whom suicide prevention strategies could be targeted.;longitudinal | mental health | Mexico | students | suicide;0;0;;;CONACYT;CB 285548;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

To date, there are many questions about the different pathological mechanisms. Here, we generate an approach to identify the cellular-level tropism of SARS-CoV-2 using human proteomics, virus-host interactions, and enrichment analysis. Through a network-based approach, the molecular context was visualized and analyzed. This procedure was also performed for SARS-CoV-1. We obtained proteomes and interactomes from 145 different cells corresponding to 57 different tissues. We discarded the cells without the proteins known for interacting with the virus, such as ACE2 or TMPRSS2. Of the remaining cells, a gradient of susceptibility to infection was observed. In addition, we identified proteins associated with the coagulation cascade that can be directly or indirectly affected by viral proteins. As a whole we identified 55 cells that could be potentially controlled by the virus, with different susceptibilities, mainly being pneumocytes, heart, kidney, liver, or small intestine cells. These results help to explain the molecular context and provide elements for possible treatments in the current situation. This strategy may be useful for other viruses, especially those with limited reported PPI, such as a new virus.;;2;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Yet most students do not receive treatment, especially in low-middle-income countries (LMICs). We aim to evaluate the effects of expanding treatment using scalable and inexpensive Internet-delivered transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) among college students with symptoms of MDD and/or GAD in two LMICs in Latin America (Colombia and Mexico) and to investigate the feasibility of creating a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict for whom iCBT is most effective. Methods: We will first carry out a multi-site randomized pragmatic clinical trial (N = 1500) of students seeking treatment at student mental health clinics in participating universities or responding to an email offering services. Students on wait lists for clinic services will be randomized to unguided iCBT (33%), guided iCBT (33%), and treatment as usual (TAU) (33%). iCBT will be provided immediately whereas TAU will be whenever a clinic appointment is available. Short-term aggregate effects will be assessed at 90 days and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will use ensemble machine learning to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of unguided versus guided iCBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to optimize individual student outcome. We will then conduct a second and third trial with separate samples (n = 500 per arm), but with unequal allocation across two arms: 25% will be assigned to the treatment determined to yield optimal outcomes based on the PTR developed in the first trial (PTR for optimal short-term outcomes for Trial 2 and 12-month outcomes for Trial 3), whereas the remaining 75% will be assigned with equal allocation across all three treatment arms. Discussion: By collecting comprehensive baseline characteristics to evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effects, we will provide valuable and innovative information to optimize treatment effects and guide university mental health treatment planning. Such an effort could have enormous public-health implications for the region by increasing the reach of treatment, decreasing unmet need and clinic wait times, and serving as a model of evidence-based intervention planning and implementation.

We investigated the conditions for potential sex change in an annual killifish (Millerichthys robustus) from temporary pools in Mexico. In natural populations, we detected adults with intersex colouration and gonads. Therefore, we experimentally tested whether this apparent sex change can be generated by manipulation of ecological and social conditions, rather than being caused by environmental disturbance. We demonstrated functional protogynous (female-to-male) sex change in 60% replicates, when groups of five females interacted and had a visual and olfactory cue of a male. Only one female changed sex in any given replicate. The sex change never occurred in isolated females. Protandrous (male-to-female) hermaphroditism was not recorded. We characterized gradual changes in behaviour, colouration and gonad structure during the sex change process. The first behavioural signs of sex change were observed after 23 days. Secondary males spawned successfully after 75 days. We discuss the adaptive potential of sex change in short-lived annual fishes through the seasonal decline of males, and during colonization of new habitats. This is the first observation of functional hermaphroditism in an annual killifish.;;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;GA ČR;19-01781S;Grantová Agentura České Republiky

To determine the presence of the Zika virus (ZIKV) and abundance of its arthropod vectors we evaluated the socioeconomic implications involved in its transmission in two highly vulnerable Mayan communities in the state of Yucatan that practice backyard farming. An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out throughout 2016 to understand socioeconomic variables and seasonal patterns in mosquito populations. We selected 20 households from each community. Social exclusion indicators were analyzed, human and domestic animals were sampled, and mosquitoes were collected and identified. Four out of eight indicators of social exclusion were higher than the reported national averages. We captured 5,825 mosquitoes from 16 species being Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti the most abundant. The presence of chickens and human overcrowding in dwellings were the most significant factors (P = 0.026) associated with the presence of Ae. aegypti. Septic tanks (odds ratio = 6.64) and chickens (odds ratio = 27.41) in backyards were the main risk factors associated with the presence of immature states of Ae. aegypti in both communities. Molecular analysis to detect ZIKV was performed in blood samples from 416 humans, 1,068 backyard animals and 381 mosquito pools. Eighteen humans and 10 pig pools tested positive for ZIKV. Forty-three mosquito pools tested positive for flavivirus. Ten of the 43 pools of positive mosquitoes were sequenced, corresponding 3/10 to ZIKV and 1/10 to Dengue virus type 2. The findings obtained indicate the continuous circulation of Flavivirus (including ZIKV) in backyard environments in vulnerable communities, highlighting the importance of studying their transmission and maintenance in these systems, due that backyard animal husbandry is a common practice in these vulnerable communities with limited access to health services.;arbovirus | backyard animal rearing | flavivirus | human-animal interface | mosquitoes | vulnerable communities | Yucatan (Mexico) | Zika virus;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;320559;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

However, there is a lack of evidence showing persistence of abnormal frontostriatal FC and its relation to cognitive flexibility performance in patients with clinically manifest HD. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the resting-state FC integrity of the frontostriatal circuit and its relation to cognitive flexibility in HD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Method: Eighteen patients with early clinical HD manifestation and 18 HCs matched for age, sex, and education participated in this study. Both groups performed the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Intra-Extra Dimensional (IED) set-shift task, which measures cognitive flexibility. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were also acquired to examine the FC in specific frontostriatal circuits. Eight regions of interest were preselected based on regions previously associated with extradimensional (ED) shifting in patients with premanifest HD. Results: Significant negative correlations between the number of attentional set-shifting errors and the ventral striatum-ventrolateral PFC FC were found in the HD group. This group also showed negative FC correlations between the total errors and the FC between right ventral striatum-right ventrolateral PFC, left ventral striatum-left ventrolateral PFC, and right ventral striatum-left ventrolateral PFC. Negative correlations between the ED errors and left ventral striatum-left ventrolateral PFC and right ventral striatum-right ventrolateral PFC FC were also found. Finally, a positive correlation between the number of stages completed and left ventral striatum-left ventrolateral PFC FC was found. Conclusions: Manifest HD patients show significant cognitive flexibility deficits in attentional set-shifting that are associated with FC alterations in the frontostriatal circuit. These results show that FC abnormalities found in the prodromal stage of the disease can also be associated with cognitive flexibility deficits at a later clinical stage, making them good candidates to be explored in longitudinal studies.;Cognitive flexibility | Frontostriatal circuit | Functional connectivity | Intra-Extra Dimensional shift learning | Resting-state functional magnetic resonance image;0;0;;;CONACYT;A1-S-10669;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This behavior is mainly triggered by hormone concentration changes and their interactions with their respective receptors in the brain, particularly oxytocin. These chemical signals also influence mother–young bonding, a critical process for neonatal survival that develops during the first postpartum hours. Currently, dairy buffalo behavior during parturition has rarely been studied. For this reason, this review aims to analyze the existing scientific evidence regarding maternal behavior in water buffalo during calving. It will address the mechanisms of imprinting, maternal care, and allosuckling strategies that may influence the survival and health of calves.;allosuckling | imprinting | maternal behavior | nursing | offspring | water buffalo;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

This work aims to make a biochemical and genomic characterization of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum JCLA3. By multilocus analysis, the species of B. pseudocatenulatum JCLA3 was established as pseudocatenulatum. It contains one circular genome of 2,369,863 bp with G + C content of 56.6%, no plasmids, 1937 CDSs, 54 tRNAs, 16 rRNAs, 1 tmRNA, 1 CRISPR region, and 401 operons predicted, including a CRISPR-Cas operon; it encodes an extensive number of enzymes, which allows it to utilize different carbohydrates. The ack gene was found as part of an operon formed by xfp and pta genes. Two genes of ldh were found at different positions. Chromosomally encoded resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin, non-hemolytic activity, and moderate inhibition of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 were demonstrated by B. pseudocatenulatum JCLA3; it can survive 100% in simulated saliva, can tolerate primary and secondary glyco- or tauro-conjugated bile salts but not in a mix of bile; the strain did not survive at pH 1.5–5. The cbh gene coding to choloylglycine hydrolase was identified in its genome, which could be related to the ability to deconjugate secondary bile salts. Intact cells showed twice as much antioxidant activity than debris. B. pseudocatenulatum JCLA3 showed 49% of adhesion to Caco-2 cells. The genome and biochemical analysis help to elucidate further possible biotechnological applications of B. pseudocatenulatum JCLA3.";Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum | gastrointestinal tract stress | genome sequencing | potential probiotic characteristics;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Due to this, it is important to have plenty of information on temperature in these ROIs in the basal state that allows their use as a reference in terms of their thermal analysis. In this work, a face thermal map of the Mexican population in the basal state (n = 196) is created, adding the comparison between different population groups, such as gender, age, and clinical status, obtaining results of great interest for future research. The t-test for independent samples was applied to the ROIs with normal distribution and Mann–Whitney u-test to the ones that did not present normal distribution. Statistically significant differences were found in some of the ROI comparisons like the corrugator, the supraorbitals, and the chin between the control and clinical groups, as well as in the differentiation by age (p < 0.05).";basal state | face | Mexican population | region of interest | thermal map;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;2019-000002-01NACF;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We aimed to analyze whether there is an association between dietary and nutrient intake and eating habits with GWG among pregnant adolescents and their offspring’s birth weight. A longitudinal study was performed with 530 participants. We assessed GWG and applied several tools, such as a food frequency questionnaire and 24-h recall, to obtain dietary and nutrient intake and eating habits. The birth weight of adolescents’ offspring was registered. Later, we performed crude and adjusted Poisson models. The mean age was 15.8 ± 1.3 years. Of all food groups, the lowest frequency of adequate intake corresponded to vegetables (7%) and legumes (10.2%). Excessive (36.8%) and insufficient (40.9%) GWG were observed. Pregnant adolescents with inadequate legumes intake increased the probability of excessive GWG: (PR 1.86 95% CI 1.00–3.44). Cereals and grains were positively associated with GWG: (PR 1.65, 95% CI 1.18–2.29). Energy, macronutrient intake, and eating habits were not associated with GWG. Offspring’s small gestational age (SGA) increased when pregnant adolescents had inadequate sugar-sweetened beverages intake: PR (1.58, 95% CI 1.01–2.49) and when pregnant adolescent watched television (TV). In our sample of Mexican adolescents, dietary and nutrient intake and eating habits were inadequate. Excessive dietary intake from cereals, grains, and animal-sourced foods along with insufficient legumes were associated with excessive GWG.

Although these are usually reactive cells, they can lead to myofibroblastic tumors that may share clinical and histomorphological characteristics but with different prognosis. The aim of this study is to perform a histomor-phological evaluation as well as to compare and evaluate two different cell proliferation immunomarkers and two endothelial markers in a group of oral and maxillofacial myofibroblastic lesions (MFL). Material and Methods: Cross-sectional and retrospective study. Demographic, clinical, histomorphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of 39 cases of MFL were analyzed. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed with the Ki67, MCM2, CD34 and CD105 antibodies. Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation analysis were used. Results: Four cases of nodular fasciitis (NF), 18 myofibromas (My), 6 desmoplastic fibromas (DF), 7 inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) and 4 myofibroblastic sarcomas (MFS) were studied. There were twenty women (51.2%); the median age was 13 [Q1-Q3: 8-24] years and most cases occurred in the mandible (48.7%). A statisti-cally significant difference with MCM2 immunostaining (p=0.0221) was observed between the MFL; further-more, a correlation between CD34 and CD105 immunostaining in NF (p <0.0001) and IMT (p=0.0408), between MCM2 and CD34 in IMT (p=0.0362) and between MCM2 and CD105 in MFS (p <0001) were found. Conclusions: MCM2 immunostaining could assess more clearly the cell growth fraction in MFL. The correlation between MCM2 and CD34 in IMT and between MCM2 and CD105 in MFS are indicative of the high activity of these lesions. These results emphasize the importance of the studied immunohistochemistry markers as possible tools for a better characterization of some of the MFL.";desmoplastic fibroma | inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor | myofibroblastic sarcoma | myofibroma | Nodular fasciitis;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;823891;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Design: We performed an analysis using Mexico's Government Epidemiological Surveillance System database for COVID-19. Emplacement: Mexico's Epidemiological Surveillance System for Respiratory Diseases. Participants: Mexican population confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 registered on Mexico's Epidemiological Surveillance System for Respiratory Diseases. Primary measurements: The analysed severe outcomes were hospitalization, pneumonia, use of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission and death. The association (odds ratio) between the outcomes and clinical variables was evaluated, comparing the three epidemiological waves in Mexico. Results: Age over 65 is associated with a higher ratio of hospitalization and pneumonia, independent of the effect of chronic comorbidities. There is an interaction between age and obesity, which is associated with hospitalization, pneumonia and highly associated with death. These findings were consistent throughout the three epidemiological waves. Conclusion: Obesity, COPD and diabetes in interaction with age, are associated with worse clinical outcomes and, more importantly, death in patients with COVID-19.;Age | Chronic diseases | COVID-19 | Mexico | SARS-CoV-2;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Although habitual terrestriality is pervasive among the apes and African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), it is largely absent among monkeys of the Americas (platyrrhines), as well as galagos, lemurs, and lorises (strepsirrhines), which are mostly arboreal. Numerous ecological drivers and species-specific factors are suggested to set the conditions for an evolutionary shift from arboreality to terrestriality, and current environmental conditions may provide analogous scenarios to those transitional periods. Therefore, we investigated predominantly arboreal, diurnal primate genera from the Americas and Madagascar that lack fully terrestrial taxa, to determine whether ecological drivers (habitat canopy cover, predation risk, maximum temperature, precipitation, primate species richness, human population density, and distance to roads) or species-specific traits (body mass, group size, and degree of frugivory) associate with increased terrestriality. We collated 150,961 observation hours across 2,227 months from 47 species at 20 sites in Madagascar and 48 sites in the Americas. Multiple factors were associated with ground use in these otherwise arboreal species, including increased temperature, a decrease in canopy cover, a dietary shift away from frugivory, and larger group size. These factors mostly explain intraspecific differences in terrestriality. As humanity modifies habitats and causes climate change, our results suggest that species already inhabiting hot, sparsely canopied sites, and exhibiting more generalized diets, are more likely to shift toward greater ground use.;primate communities j primate evolution j evolutionary transitions j niche shift j climate change;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;NSF;BCS 0851761;National Science Foundation

We aimed to study the associations of Pb, Hg, and Mn prenatal levels (jointly and separately) with neurodevelopment in the first year of life. Methods: Pb, Hg, and Mn blood lead levels were measured in 253 pregnant women. Their offspring’s neurodevelopment was assessed through the Bayley Scale of Infant Development III® at one, three, six, and twelve months. The metals’ mean blood levels (µg/L) were Pb = 11.2, Hg = 2.1, and Mn = 10.2. Mean language, cognitive, and motor development scores of the infants at each age were between low-average and average. Multilevel models’ results showed that language development coefficients of the offspring decreased by 1.5 points per 1 µg/dL increase in maternal blood lead levels (p = 0.002); the magnitude of the aforementioned association increased in children with maternal blood Mn < 9.6 µg/L (ß = −1.9, p = 0.003) or Hg > 1.9 µg/L (ß = −1.6, p = 0.013). Cognitive and motor development had negative associations with maternal blood Pb levels; the latter was statistically significant when the interaction term between Pb, Mn, and Hg was included (ß = −0.037, p = 0.03). Prenatal exposure to low Pb levels may impair infants’ neurodevelopment in the first year of life, even more so if they are exposed to Hg or deficient in Mn.";children | co-exposure | lead | manganese | mercury | neurodevelopment | prenatal;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;71626;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Labor is a potentially stressful and painful event, due to the contractions that promote expulsion of the fetus. During labor, neurotransmitters such as the prostaglandins contribute to the sensitization of oxytocin receptors in the myometrium and the activation of nociceptive fibers, thus supporting the physiological role of pain. Endogenously, the body secretes opioid peptides that modulate harmful stimuli and, at the same time, can inhibit oxytocin’s action in the myometrium. Treating pain during the different stages of parturition is an option that can help prevent such consequences as tachycardia, changes in breathing patterns, and respiratory acidosis, all of which can harm the wellbeing of offspring. However, studies have found that some analgesics can promote myometrial contractility, increase expulsion time, affect fetal circulation, and alter mother–offspring recognition due to hypnotic effects. Other data, however, indicate that reducing the number of uterine contractions with analgesics increases their potency, thus improving maternal performance. Managing pain during labor requires understanding the tocolytic properties of analgesics and their advantages in preventing the consequences of pain.;analgesics | calving | farrowing | labor pain | pain;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Though there are still gaps in the literature regarding its plausible beneficial effects, the suggestion that this alternative therapy can improve the inflammatory and antioxidant response to control epileptic seizures is explored throughout this study. Epilepsy is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world. However, the appropriate mechanisms for it to be fully controlled are still unknown. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress promote epileptic seizures' appearance and might even aggravate them. There is growing evidence that caloric restriction has extensive anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. For instance, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have been proposed to induce antioxidant processes and ulteriorly improve the disease progression. Caloric restriction can be an option for those patients with refractory epilepsy since it allows for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties to evolve within the brain areas involved.;Antioxidant | Caloric restriction | Epilepsy | Neuroinflammation | Nrf2 | Oxidative stress;0;0;;;IPN;1025766;Instituto Politécnico Nacional

Pain is a central ethical concern. The activation of neural pathways involved in the pain response has physiological, endocrine, and behavioral consequences, that can affect both the health and welfare of the animals, as well as the validity of research. The strategy to prevent these consequences requires understanding of the nociception process, pain itself, and how assessment can be performed using validated, non-invasive methods. The study of facial expressions related to pain has undergone considerable study with the finding that certain movements of the facial muscles (called facial action units) are associated with the presence and intensity of pain.

The incursion of oral history and social history, allows researchers a philosophical-epistemological reflection to approach the concrete totality, going from the sensible concrete, to the concrete thought, with the narratives of the protagonists through two life stories; one of them, that of a teacher with a long experience of struggle in favor of collective rights, from the organized social resistance; the other, is that of a teacher who balances from the canons of submission to hegemony. Both show subjectivity as the fundamental element to understand the paths through which health and illness are expressed and also allow to give way to an alternative to define healthy spaces where the emancipation of human capacities in the collectives to move towards health is propitiated and promoted.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with essential oils (EOs) on productive performance, rumen parameters, serum metabolites, and quality of products (meat and milk) derived from small ruminants by means of a meta-analysis. Seventy-four peer-reviewed publications were included in the data set. Weighted mean differences (WMD) between the EOs treatments and the control treatment were used to assess the magnitude of effect. Dietary inclusion of EOs increased (p < 0.05) dry matter intake (WMD = 0.021 kg/d), dry matter digestibility (WMD = 14.11 g/kg of DM), daily weight gain (WMD = 0.008 kg/d), and feed conversion ratio (WMD = −0.111). The inclusion of EOs in small ruminants’ diets decreased (p < 0.05) ruminal ammonia nitrogen concentration (WMD = −0.310 mg/dL), total protozoa (WMD = −1.426 × 105/mL), methanogens (WMD = −0.60 × 107/mL), and enteric methane emissions (WMD = −3.93 L/d) and increased ruminal propionate concentration (WMD = 0.726 mol/100 mol, p < 0.001). The serum urea concentration was lower (WMD = −0.688 mg/dL; p = 0.009), but serum catalase (WMD = 0.204 ng/mL), superoxide dismutase (WMD = 0.037 ng/mL), and total antioxidant capacity (WMD = 0.749 U/mL) were higher (p < 0.05) in response to EOs supplementation. In meat, EOs supplementation decreased (p < 0.05) the cooking loss (WMD = −0.617 g/100 g), malondialdehyde content (WMD = −0.029 mg/kg of meat), yellowness (WMD = −0.316), and total viable bacterial count (WMD = −0.780 CFU/g of meat). There was higher (p < 0.05) milk production (WMD = 0.113 kg/d), feed efficiency (WMD = 0.039 kg/kg), protein (WMD = 0.059 g/100 g), and lactose content in the milk (WMD = 0.100 g/100 g), as well as lower somatic cell counts in milk (WMD = −0.910 × 103 cells/mL) in response to EOs supplementation. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with EOs improves productive performance as well as meat and milk quality of small ruminants. In addition, EOs improve antioxidant status in blood serum and rumen fermentation and decrease environmental impact.";antioxidant status | carcass traits | enteric methane | meat quality | milk quality;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Porcine orthorubulavirus (PRV) is the etiological agent, and the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) is characterized as the best antigen for serological tests, although other structural proteins, including the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix (M) protein, have been investigated during the infection of members of the Paramyxoviridae family, generating promising results. Herein, for the first time, we successfully produced and characterized both the NP and M proteins of PRV by using a recombinant strategy in the E. coli heterologous system. The ORF of the NP and M genes were cloned in-frame with the pET-SUMO expression vector. Recombinant proteins proved to be a sensitive target to detect seroconversion at 7 days until 28 days in vaccinated mice (BALB/c) by indirect ELISAs. Immunoreactivity was also tested using porcine serum samples, in which antibodies were recognized from early stages to a persistence of PRV infection, which is indicative that these proteins contain properties similar to native antigens. The predicted tertiary structure showed that both proteins have a conserved structure that resembles those found in others Paramyxovirus.

The objective of the study was to include giant squid (Dosidicus gigas) meal (GSM) in broiler rations to increase the content of the n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosapentaenoic (DPA), and docosahexaenoic (DHA) in chicken meat. Two hundred Ross 380 chickens, half male, half female, and one day old, were randomly distributed in a 4x2x2 factorial arrangement. The factors were the treatment (0%, 1.67%, 3.34%, and 5.01% of GSM in the diet), sex, and content of n-3 in the legs with thighs and the breasts. Each treatment had five repetitions with 10 birds each. There were no differences (p > 0.05) in the production parameters for both sexes. The contents of EPA, DPA, and DHA increased in the females and in the legs with thighs (p < 0.05) with GSM. Acceptance for the flavor and texture of meat was higher in the treatment with 1.67% GSM than in the other treatments.

Animal fighting, including dogfighting, is a prime example where animals often require veterinary care, either to treat wounds and fractures or to manage pain associated with tissue and where death may even result. Amongst the detrimental health effects arising are the sensory alterations that these injuries cause, which not only include acute or chronic pain but can also trigger a greater sensitivity to other harmful (hyperalgesia) or even innocuous stimuli (allodynia). These neurobiological aspects are often ignored and the erroneous assumption made that the breeds engaged in organized fighting have a high pain threshold or, at least, they present reduced or delayed responses to painful stimuli. However, it is now widely recognized that the damage these dogs suffer is not only physical but psychological, emotional, and sensory. Due to the impact fighting has on canine welfare, it is necessary to propose solution strategies, especially educational ones, i.e., educating people and training veterinarians, the latter potentially playing a key role in alerting people to all dog welfare issues. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the risk factors associated with dogfighting generally (dog temperament, age, sex, nutrition, testosterone levels, environment, isolation conditions, socialization, education, or training). A neurobiological approach to this topic is taken to discuss the impact on dog pain and emotion. Finally, a general discussion of the format of guidelines and laws that seek to sanction them is presented. The role that veterinarians can play in advancing dog welfare, rehabilitating dogs, and educating the public is also considered.;animal fight | dog aggression | dog fight | dog welfare | illegal sports | pain;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

It is also over-expressed in most malignant neoplasia, partic-ipating in the initiation, progression, and metastatic dissemination of the tumor. The expression and roles of this protein in oral neoplasia, particularly in odontogenic tumors, remain unestablished. The objective of this study consisted in analyzing the expression of this protein in ameloblastoma and tooth germ. Material and Methods: Ep-CAM (MOC-31) expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tooth germs (TG) (n = 16) ameloblastomas (AM) (n = 60) and 2 ameloblastic carcinomas. Sections were visualized in their totality with an optical microscope, and positivity observed in cell membrane and cytoplasm was graded according to the following semi-quantitative scale: Neg, ""essentially unstained"", for negative sections or staining <5% of cells; + for staining of 5-50% of cells; ++ for staining >50% of cells. Results: Most tooth germs expressed MOC-31 (81.3%), strong staining was observed both in the inner epithelium of the enamel organ and in the adjacent stellate reticulum. 16.7% of the AM cases showed MOC-31 expression, the immunoexpression expression was diffuse at the cytoplasmic and membrane level. The only two cases of ameloblastic carcinoma included were strong positive to MOC-31. No correlation was observed between protein expression and gender, age, clinical variants, or histological subtypes. Conclusions: Overexpression was found in TG and ameloblastic carcinoma compared to AM; further studies with different experimental strategies are suggested to clarify the biological significance of this finding.";ameloblastoma | Ep-CAM | immunohistochemistry | MOC-31 | Tooth germ;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CSIC;881880;Comisión Sectorial de Investigación Científica

Didymozoid infection route during the early life cycle was inferred combining morphological (light microscopy) and molecular (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, cox1) evidence. Didymozoid rediae parasitizing F. desmarestia were observed, just after field collection of the host, containing hundredths of completely developed cystophorous cercariae, releasing them though the birth pore at approximately one cercaria every 12 s. Cercariae lost their tails developing into a ‘young metacercaria’ in 1 d at 22 °C without need of an intermediate host. Molecular analysis of cox1 showed that rediae found in F. desmarestia belong to two distinct didymozoid species (Didymozoidae sp. 1 and sp. 2). Metacercariae parasitizing chaetognaths were morphologically identified as Didymozoidae type Monilicaecum and cox1 sequences showed that metacercariae of chaetognaths matched with these two Didymozoidae sp. 1, and sp. 2 species found parasitizing F. desmarestia, plus a third distinct Didymozoidae sp. 3. These are the first DNA sequences of cox1 gene from didymozoid larvae for any zooplankton taxonomic group in the world. We concluded that F. desmarestia is the first intermediate host of rediae and cercariae, and the chaetognaths are the second intermediate hosts where non-encysted metacercariae were found. The definitive host is still unknown because cox1 sequences of present study did not genetically match with any available cox1 sequence of adult didymozoid. Our results demonstrate a potential overlap in the distribution of two carnivorous zooplankton taxonomic groups that are intermediate hosts of didymozoids in the pelagic habitat. The didymozoid specimens were not identified to species level because any of the cox1 sequences generated here matched with the sequences of adult didymozoids currently available in GenBank and Bold System databases. This study provides baseline information for the future morphological and molecular understanding of the Didymozoidae larvae that has been previously based on the recognition of the 12 known morphotypes.;Carnivorous zooplankton | Cox1 | Cystophorous cercariae | Gulf of California | Metacercariae | Rediae;1;0;repositoryam;Green;UQ;20150113;University of Queensland

The animals were divided into six groups; three performed exercise on a treadmill for 5 days/week for 20 months, and the other three were sedentary. Also, two groups of each were treated with MTF for 6 or 12 months. The rats were euthanized at 24 months. The mitochondria were isolated and supercomplexes formation along with oxygen consumption, ATP synthesis, and ROS generation were evaluated. Our results showed that the combined treatment for 12 months increased the complex I and IV activities associated with the supercomplexes, simultaneously, ATP synthesis increased while ROS production decreased, indicating a tightly coupled mitochondria. The role of exercise plus the MTF treatment against sarcopenia in old muscles is discussed.";Aging | ATP synthesis | Mitochondrial supercomplexes | ROS generation | Sarcopenia;1;0;;;CONACYT;FOSSIS-272256;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Data regarding the sex, age, and tumor location of all cases, as well as the histologic grade and history of exposure to risk habits of cases diagnosed as OSCC in young patients (≤ 40 years of age) were obtained. The Chi-square test was used to determine any increasing trend. A total of 10,727 OSCC cases were identified, of which 626 cases affected young patients (5.8%). Manipal institution (India) showed the highest number of young patients (13.2%). Males were the most affected in both age groups, with the tongue and floor of the mouth being the most affected subsites. OSCC in young individuals were usually graded as well or moderately differentiated. Only 0.9% of the cases occurred in young patients without a reported risk habit. There was no increasing trend in the institutions and the period investigated (p > 0.05), but a decreasing trend was observed in Hong Kong and the sample as a whole (p < 0.001).

The need for healthcare is pressing, materials and instruments are scarce, and exposure to pain and suffering is constant. These adverse conditions have an adverse impact on the physical and mental health of healthcare professionals. The nursing staffs are among those who are most affected, and they frequently experience burnout syndrome or one of its several dimensions, including emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Purpose The aim of this research was to analyze the relationship among working conditions, related stress, and the dimensions of burnout syndrome in a tertiary care public hospital in Mexico City. Methods A cross-sectional design was applied on a random sample of 190 nurses in a public hospital in Mexico City. Working conditions and burnout syndrome were evaluated using standardized instruments. Adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated. Three clusters, one for each burnout dimension, were generated and then evaluated using a correspondence analysis with labor characteristics. Results One quarter (25%) of the participants self-reported a sense of personal accomplishment, and 12% reported emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. The labor variables that were found to be associated with the dimensions of burnout were workload, performing potentially hazardous work, and conducting tedious tasks. Positive conditions were shown to decrease the prevalence of burnout in all three dimensions. Conclusions/Implications for Practice Working conditions for nursing staff impact the mental health of nurses and affect the quality of the healthcare they provide. The set of work demands and stressors to which they are exposed should be controlled and modified to ensure a healthy work environment.;burnout | nursing | stressors | value of work | working conditions;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;UAM-PTC-628;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Ruminants are precocial whose mechanisms for generating heat or preventing heat loss involve genetic characteristics, the degree of neurodevelopment at birth and environmental aspects. These elements combine to form a more efficient mechanism than those found in altricial species. Although the degree of neurodevelopment is an important advantage for these species, their greater mobility helps them to search for the udder and consume colostrum after birth. However, anatomical differences such as the distribution of adipose tissue or the presence of type II muscle fibers could lead to the understanding that these species use their energy resources more efficiently for heat production. The introduction of unconventional ruminant species, such as the water buffalo, has led to rethinking other characteristics like the skin thickness or the coat type that could intervene in the thermoregulation capacity of the newborn. Implementing tools to analyze species-specific characteristics that help prevent a critical decline in temperature is deemed a fundamental strategy for avoiding the adverse effects of a compromised thermoregulatory function. Although thermography is a non-invasive method to assess superficial temperature in several non-human animal species, in newborn ruminants there is limited information about its application, making it necessary to discuss the usefulness of this tool. This review aims to analyze the effects of hypothermia in newborn ruminants, their thermoregulation mechanisms that compensate for this condition, and the application of infrared thermography (IRT) to identify cases with hypothermia.;cattle | goat | infrared thermography | newborn/neonate | sheep | thermoregulation | water buffalo | wild ruminants;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Studying subjects with no valve impairments and CAVD patients, we also sought to quantify the independent contribution or explanatory capacity of the aortic valve echocardiographic parameters involved in the HRV changes caused by active standing using hierarchical partitioning models to consider other variables or potential confounders. We detected smaller adjustments of the cardiac autonomic response at active standing caused specifically by the aortic valve deterioration. The highest association (i.e., the highest percentage of independent exploratory capacity) was found between the aortic valve area and the active standing changes in the short-term HRV scaling exponent α1 (4.591%). The valve’s maximum pressure gradient echocardiographic parameter was present in most models assessed (in six out of eight models of HRV indices that included a valve parameter as an independent variable). Overall, our study provides insights with a wider perspective to explore and consider CAVD as a neurocardiovascular pathology.

Because periodontal disease is one of the most frequent inflammatory diseases of the oral cavity, various theories have emerged postulating periodontal disease as a risk factor for developing severe complications associated with COVID-19. This motivated various studies to integrate questions related to periodontal status. For the present work, we used a previously validated self-report, which is a useful tool for facilitating epidemiological studies of periodontal disease on a large scale. Methodology: A blinded case-control study with participants matched 1:1 by mean age (37.7 years), sex, tobacco habits and diseases was conducted. After the diagnostic samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection were taken in an ad hoc location at Guadalajara University, the subjects were interviewed using structured questionnaires to gather demographic, epidemiological and COVID-19 symptom information. The self-reported periodontal disease (Self-RPD) questionnaire included six questions, and subjects who met the criteria with a score ≥ 2 were considered to have periodontal disease. Results: In total, 369 participants were recruited, with 117 participants included in each group. After indicating the subjects who had self-reported periodontal disease, a statistically significant difference (p value ≤ 0.001) was observed, showing that self-reported periodontal disease (n = 95, 85.1%) was higher in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals than in controls (n = 66, 56.4%), with an OR of 3.3 (1.8–6.0) for SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with self-reported periodontal disease. Cases reported a statistically higher median of symptoms (median = 7.0, Q1= 5.5, Q3 = 10.0) than controls (p value ≤ 0.01), and cases with positive self-RPD had a significantly (p value ≤ 0.05) higher number of symptoms (median = 8.0, Q1 = 6.0, Q3 = 10.0) in comparison with those who did negative self-RPD (median = 6.0, Q1 = 5.0, Q3 = 8.0). Conclusions: According to this study, self-reported periodontal disease could be considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and these individuals present more symptoms.;case-control studies | COVID-19 | periodontal disease | SARS-CoV-2 | self-report;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;11482;Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Occidente, Universidad Jesuita de Guadalajara

Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has been shown to be a tool to early diagnose gastric mucosal damage induced by ischemia. A therapeutic alternative to reduce this type of injury is melatonin (MT), which has gastroprotective effects in I/R models. In this work, the effect of treatment with MT on the electrical properties of gastric tissue, biomarkers of inflammatory (iNOS and COX-2), proliferation, and apoptotic process under I/R conditions in male Wistar rats was evaluated through EIS, histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Treatment with MT prevents gastric mucosa damage, causing a decrease in gastric impedance parameters related to the inflammatory process and cellular damage. This suggests that EIS could be used as a tool to diagnose and monitor the evolution of gastric mucosal injury, as well as in the recovery process in critically ill patients.;;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

It is our objective Methods In this study, we included a cohort of patients with aortic valve damage treated by AVR with mechanical prosthesis, bio prosthesis and we included a control group. Results We found that IL-4 and osteopontin levels were higher in patients with mechanical vs biological prostheses (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively), osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels were decreased (p=0.01), women had lower levels of ET-1 and IL-6, (p=0.02) (p=0.04), respectively. Patients older than 60 years had decreased levels of IL-1ß p<0.001) and a higher concentration of IL-4 p<0.05). IL-1ß, OPG and TNFα were higher in patients with less than 5 years of evolution vs more than 10 years (p=0.004, p=0.02 and p=0.03, respectively). Factors such as age, gender, prosthetic and elevated IL-1B and ET-1 levels are associated with valve dysfunction prosthetic. These results indicate that the inflammatory involvement present prior to valve replacement may be perpetuated by various factors in the long term. Conclusions The findings provide us with the opportunity to effectively treat patients with AVR in the postoperative period, which could prolong the functionality of the bio prostheses.

Disease severity may be associated with a metabolic imbalance related to amino acids, lipids, and energy-generating pathways. The aim of this study was to characterize the profile of amino acids and acylcarnitines in COVID-19 patients. A multicenter, cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 453 individuals were classified by disease severity. Levels of 11 amino acids, 31 acylcarnitines, and succinylacetone in serum samples were analyzed by electrospray ionization–triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Different clusters were observed in partial least squares discriminant analysis, with phenylalanine, alanine, citrulline, proline, and succinylacetone providing the major contribution to the variability in each cluster (variable importance in the projection >1.5). In logistic models adjusted by age, sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and nutritional status, phenylalanine was associated with critical outcomes (odds ratio=5.3 (95% CI 3.16-9.2) in the severe vs. critical model, with an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.90). In conclusion the metabolic imbalance in COVID-19 patients might affect disease progression. This work shows an association of phenylalanine with critical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, highlighting phenylalanine as a potential metabolic biomarker of disease severity.;amino acids | COVID-19 | metabolomics | phenylalanine | SARS – CoV – 2;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;INP;14080;Instituto Nacional de Pediatria

Their relationship with oxidative stress has motivated the research to find therapies and medications capable of suppressing oxidative damage and therefore slowing the progression of these diseases. Glutathione (GSH) is the most important cellular antioxidant in living beings and is responsible for regulating the cellular redox state. However, GSH cannot be administered by any route of administration, so molecules that increase its levels by activating Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway are explored; since Nrf2 regulates the main genes involved in GSH de novo synthesis and recycling. Astrocytes are the most important cell-type in the antioxidant cell response and are responsible for providing GSH and other substrates for neurons to have an efficient antioxidant response. Methotrexate (MTX) is an anti-inflammatory agent that has different cellular effects when administered at low or high concentrations. So in this study, we used MTX different concentrations and exposure times to induce a hormetic antioxidant response in rat primary astrocytes. Our results showed that 20 nM MTX pre-conditioning for 12 h augmented the GSH/GSSG ratio and protected cellular viability against a toxic MTX and H2O2 insult, which was abrogated when Nrf2 was inhibited by brusatol. Hence, MTX subsequent studies as a drug to counteract the progression of some stress-associated neurodegenerative diseases are suggested.";astrocytes | glutathione | hormesis | methotrexate | neurodegeneration | redox state;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;919024;

This study explored whether the lockdown in Italy affected the cat–owner relationship, as well as cat behaviour and welfare. A survey that included questions on owner and cat’s demographics, living environment, cat behaviour and a modified version of the Cat/Dog Relationship Scale (C/DORS) was distributed online during the lockdown and was completed by 548 cat owners, mainly women (81.6%). With regard to the C/DORS subscales, both emotional closeness and cat–owner interactions increased during confinement, as opposed to a reduction in perceived costs. The effect of the type of job, family role and owner’s age on the C/DORS scores suggests that the relationship improved for those owners that, due to the lockdown, increased the time spent with their cats. For 58.8% of respondents, their cat’s general behaviour did not change, but when changes occurred, they were mostly positive (20.4%). Attention-seeking and demanding behaviours were the most increased during lockdown (25.7%). Cats with pre-existing problematic behaviours tended to either remain stable or improve during confinement. The overall positive effects of lockdown-related environmental changes on a cat’s behaviour suggest that some aspects of commonly implemented cat management practices should be revised to improve cat welfare in normal circumstances.;cat welfare | cat–owner interactions | cat–owner relationship | COVID-19 | lockdown;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

A systematic review was carried out in two databases using keywords related to the effects produced by the intake of PEs in the diet on the reproduction of animals for slaughter, only controlled studies developed in vivo were considered. Contradictory results were found, on the one hand, the intake of a high content of polyphenolic compounds from different fodders, in the bovine female, was related to the decrease in fertility, presence of abortions and ovarian cysts; on the other hand, the intake of the high content of PEs induced an increase in the semen quality of the males of the species: cattle, sheep and leporids, so these effects can be attributed to the concentration, the type of PEs, sex, species and even the breed of the animal.";Coumestans | Isoflavones | Lignans | Phytoestrogens | Reproductive effects | Slaughter animals;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

When the needle can-not be recovered instantly, its three-dimensional imaging location must be established and handling decided. In such a situation, its surgical elimination is the most recommen-ded proposal due to the possibility of migrating and inju-ring important anatomical structures. Objective: Conduct a literature review and present a cli-nical case of dental needle rupture located in the pterygo-maxillary space, resolved with a lateropharyngeal intrao-ral approach. Case presentation: An 8-year-old male patient, who co-mes to the consultation for a ruptured dental needle. To obtain its location, a cone-beam computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction was used at closed and open mouth. This test offered greater precision and anatomical correspondence, considering that surgical removal could be performed by an intraoral approach. This was done and during the surgical intervention it was no-ticed that the needle had migrated to an upper and pos-terior location, to the pterygomaxillary space. Faced with this situation, his recovery was more complex, in addition to the one that this procedure represents by itself. Conclusions: Intraoral local anesthesia is not exempt from its own complications such as the rupture of the dental needle. When this event occurs, the result can be very difficult to manage.;complications | dental anesthesia | needle;0;0;;;;undefined;

Along with increasing age, type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of central nervous system disorders and cognitive impairment due to the loss of synaptic function. Central damage triggers an astroglial response, increasing the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which can be found peripherally when the blood-brain barrier is compromised. Aim of the Study: To evaluate the value of GFAP as a peripheral biomarker of central dysfunction. Methods. Serum levels of GFAP were compared between cases of NCD (n = 69) and age-matched controls (n = 69), analyzing the influence of diabetes as contributing factor. Results: We found higher levels of serum GFAP in subjects with NCD compared with the control group (p <0.0001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using the GFAP levels showed 65.22% sensitivity and 71.01% specificity (AUC = 0.7608), indicating good performance in the classification of controls and NCD patients. Logistic regression indicated a positive predictive power of 67.50% considering T2D status; adding GFAP levels, the predictive power rises to 71.93%. GFAP levels and T2D could be considered good predictors of NCD risk. Conclusions: Our findings open the possibility that peripheral GFAP could be used as an objective measurement related, under certain conditions, to central damage; thereby serving as a follow-up marker to refer diabetic patients for appropriate neurological evaluation, which could offer a low cost, minimally invasive strategy to improve the assessment of cognitive affectation and subsequent treatment.";Biomarker | Dementia | Diabetes | GFAP;0;0;;;CONACYT;FIS/IMSS/PROT/PRIO/13/024;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

However, the rate of newborns produced using this technique remains low. Embryos produced through SCNT exhibit abnormal gene expression, often regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications, which establish the genome imprinted for the ontogenetic development of mammals. The objective of the present review was to describe the current state of the efficiency of sheep embryo production and newborn lamb generation through SCNT to offer an up-to-date reference. The primary strategy to improve SCNT in sheep is nuclear reprogramming. As such, the supplementation of vitamin C, scriptaid, zebularine, and oocyte extracts during somatic cell and embryo culture could improve nuclear reprogramming in cloned sheep embryos. Further, the modification of somatic cell chromatin and substitution of histones with protamines have been explored as additional strategies to improve SCNT. Elucidating the complexity of these processes will allow for the application of treatments or strategies aimed at improving the efficiency of SCNT and ensuring the quality of the produced offspring.;Efficiency | Embryos | SCNT | Sheep;0;0;;;CONACYT;570413;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

For IgA/SIgA responses, IL-4/IL-6 mRNA levels were decreased by all drugs and pIgR mRNA was increased by CCK8 and reduced by L365,260. IgA+ B cell percentage and α chain mRNA levels were elicited by CCK8 and L365,260.

Fetal hypoxia causes distress and acidemia. Identifying physiological blood alterations in the puppy during the first minute of life through the blood gas exchange of the umbilical cord could determine the puppy’s risk of suffering asphyxiation during labor. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the birth order and dam’s size during spontaneous labor and the alterations during the first minute of life. The results indicate that the dam’s size and the birth order have considerable physiological and metabolic effects in the puppies, mainly in birth order 1 (BO1) in small-size dogs, while in the medium size, the last puppy presented more alterations, probably because of a prolonged whelping which could have fostered hypoxic processes and death. Likewise, with large-size dogs, intrapartum asphyxiation processes were registered during the first minute of life in any birth order.;asphyxia | hypoxia | physiological blood profile | puppy welfare | size | whelping;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Methods: In this study, COVID-19 contagion and mortality data were used, as well as socio-economic variables, from public databases and open access, with which an econometric model was estimated. Results: It shows that the number of deaths can rise when variables related to vulnerable groups increase, such as poverty, lack of services, gender, and age. In addition, having pre-existing medical conditions or lacking access to water can be a significant factor in the increase in deaths. Conclusions: Therefore, this study suggests more policies be developed for vulnerable groups to reduce gaps in inequality, particularly given the current situation in which greater inequality can exacerbate the impact of a disease or an unforeseen situation, as is the case of COVID-19.;COVID-19 | Health | Poverty | Vulnerability | Water;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The aim was to estimate the prevalence and the characteristics of symptomatic axial OA in Spain. Methods: EPISER2016 is a cross-sectional multicenter population-based study of people aged 40 years or older. Subjects were randomly selected using multistage stratified cluster sampling. Participants were contacted by telephone to complete rheumatic disease screening questionnaires. Two phenotypes were analyzed, patients with Non-exclusive axial OA (NEA-OA) and Exclusive axial OA (EA-OA). To calculate the prevalence and its 95% confidence interval (CI), the sample design was considered and weighting was calculated according to age, sex and geographic origin. Results: Prevalence of NEA-OA by clinical or clinical-radiographic criteria was 19.17% (95% CI: 17.82–20.59). The frequency of NEA-OA increased with age (being 3.6 times more likely in patients aged 80 s or more than in those between 40 and 49 years) and body mass index. It was significantly more frequent in women, as well as in the center of Spain. It was less frequent in those with a higher level of education. Lumbar OA was more frequent than cervical OA. This difference grew with increasing age and was not associated with gender. It was also greater in overweight and obese subjects.

Current guidelines recommend measuring ER with indirect calorimetry (IC) when possible. Due to clinical settings, the use of simple formulas is preferred. Few studies have modeled equations for estimating ER for CKD. Nevertheless, variables of interest such as nutritional status and strength have not been explored in these models. This study aimed to develop and validate a model for estimating REE in patients with CKD stages 3–5, who were not receiving renal replacement therapy (RTT), using clinical variables and comparing it with indirect calorimetry as the gold standard. Methods: In this study 80 patients with CKD participated. Indirect calorimetry (IC) was performed in all patients. The calorimeter analyzed metabolic measurements every minute for 15 min after autocalibration with barometric pressure, temperature, and humidity. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) was performed. Fat-free mass (FFM) was registered among other bioelectrical components. Handgrip strength (HGS) was evaluated and an average of 3 repetitions was recorded. Nutritional status was assessed with the subjective global assessment (SGA). Patients categorized as B or C were then considered as having malnutrition. Results: We analyzed 71 patients and 3 models were generated. Model 1a included FFM; Model 2a included weight; Model 3c included handgrip strength (HGS). All other variables were stepwise, computer-selected with a p < 0.01 significance level; Malnutrition was consistently associated with ER among other clinical variables in all models (p < 0.05). The model that included BIA-FFM had R2adjusted = 0.46, while the model that included weight (Kg) had an adjusted R2adjusted = 0.44. The models had moderate concordance, LC = 0.60–0.65 with the gold standard, whereas other energy expenditure estimation equations had LC = 0.36 and 0.55 with indirect calorimetry. Using these previously validated equations as a reference, our models had concordance values ranging from 0.66 to 0.80 with them. Conclusion: Models incorporating nutritional status and other clinical variables such as weight, FFM, comorbidities, gender, and age have a moderate agreement with REE. The agreement between our models and others previously validated for the CKD patient is good; however, the agreement between the latter and IC measurements is moderate.

We aimed to evaluate epigenetic age and DNA methylome differences between CLZ-treated patients and those without psychopharmacological treatment. The DNA methylome was analyzed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip in 31 CLZ-treated patients with psychotic disorders and 56 patients with psychiatric disorders naive to psychopharmacological treatment. Delta age (Δage) was calculated as the difference between predicted epigenetic age and chronological age. CLZ-treated patients were stratified by sex, age, and years of treatment. Differential methylation sites between both groups were determined using linear regression models. The Δage in CLZ-treated patients was on average lower compared with drug-naive patients for the three clocks analyzed; however, after data-stratification, this difference remained only in male patients. Additional differences were observed in Hannum and Horvath clocks when comparing chronological age and years of CLZ treatment. We identified 44,716 differentially methylated sites, of which 87.7% were hypomethylated in CLZ-treated patients, and enriched in the longevity pathway genes. Moreover, by protein–protein interaction, AMPK and insulin signaling pathways were found enriched. CLZ could promote a lower Δage in individuals with long-term treatment and modify the DNA methylome of the longevity-regulating pathways genes.";clozapine | DNA methylome | epigenetic age | longevity | psychotic disorders;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;766012;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Methods: Mexican patients with gout from the National Rehabilitation Institute and General Hospital of Mexico were enrolled. A healthy control group was also included. We analyzed the frequency and allelic distribution of eight SNPs from seven different genes within the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway: TLR4 rs2149356, CD14 rs2569190, NLRP3 rs3806268, NLRP3 rs10754558, CARD8 rs2043211, IL-1β rs1143623, P2RX7 rs3751142, and PPARGC1B rs45520937 SNPs.

Unfortunately, commercial simulators are costly, which limits their use and makes it necessary to develop low-cost simulators for training purposes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an easily constructed, low-cost, high-fidelity renal simulator for use in diagnostic ultrasound training of veterinary medical students. To construct the simulators, donated cat kidneys were embedded in a prepared agar matrix. The echogenicity of ultrasound scans obtained on the kidney simulator was assessed by the subject lecturers and compared with images acquired during clinical routine diagnostic procedures. Five students with no prior experience of the technique, under the direct supervision of a lecturer, performed five B-mode ultrasound examinations of the renal structure of the simulator. The structure of the kidney was assessed, and its length, width and thickness were measured. Three lecturers performed the same procedure as the students, and their results were used for comparison. Appropriate anatomical and ultrasonographic realism was achieved for each of the three layers of the kidney (cortex, medulla and pelvis), and similar pixel values were obtained with the simulator model and actual clinical diagnostic ultrasounds. In addition, the kidney dimensions acquired by the students were consistent with those acquired by the lecturers. Thus, the proposed kidney simulator can be used for the training of veterinary medicine students in ultrasonographic diagnostic techniques.;kidney | training model | ultrasonography | veterinary education;1;0;;;;undefined;

In this context, this research assessed the feasibility of using landfill leachate as a source of nutrients for the growth of maize. Leachate was treated to precipitate struvite, a rich magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium mineral that can be applied directly as fertilizer. It was used for the growth of maize, which was sowed in three different parcels. A commercial DAP + urea mixture was used to compare, and non-fertilized parcels were used as controls. Struvite was successfully obtained and applied in the fields. A marginal higher maize yield was achieved in two sites when using struvite (6.36% and 2.16%) compared to the commercial fertilizer, even if it was applied in a lower dose to weather conditions. An increase in N and Mg in soil could be observed, which allowed for the assimilation of nutrients in the plants.

When exposed to cold weather, which is a risk factor associated with mortality in neonates, pathways such as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) are activated to achieve temperature control, increasing the circulating levels of catecholamine and cortisol. Consequently, alterations in blood circulation and mechanisms to produce or to retain heat (e.g., vasoconstriction, piloerection, shivering, brown adipocyte tissue activation, and huddling) begin to prevent hypothermia. This study aimed to discuss the mechanisms of thermoregulation in newborn domestic mammals, highlighting the differences between altricial and precocial species. The processes that employ brown adipocyte tissue, shivering, thermoregulatory behaviors, and dermal vasomotor control will be analyzed to understand the physiology and the importance of implementing techniques to promote thermoregulation and survival in the critical post-birth period of mammals. Also, infrared thermography as a helpful method to perform thermal measurements without animal interactions does not affect these parameters.;body temperature | brown adipose tissue | neonate welfare | shivering | thermoregulation | vasoconstriction;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Twenty-eight Pelibuey × Katahdin lambs (20.52 ± 0.88 kg body weight (BW)) were housed in individual pens and assigned to four treatments (n = 7) with different doses of PA: 0 (CON), 1 (PA1), 2 (PA2), and 3 (PA3) g of PA kg−1 of DM for 56 days. Compared to the CON, lambs in PA1 treatment had higher average daily gain (p = 0.03), higher dietary energy utilization (p = 0.01), greater backfat thickness (p = 0.02), greater Longissimus dorsi muscle area (p = 0.01), and better feed conversion ratio (p = 0.02). PA supplementation did not affect (p > 0.05) dry matter intake, carcass yield, biometric measures, and meat chemical composition. All hematological and most of the blood biochemical parameters were similar in lambs of all treatments (p > 0.05). However, compared to the CON, lambs assigned to the PA3 treatment had lower serum urea concentration (p = 0.05) and higher serum albumin concentration (p = 0.03). In conclusion, low doses of PA could be used as a growth promoter in finishing lambs without affecting dry matter intake, carcass yield, meat chemical composition, and health status of the lambs. However, more in vivo research is needed to better understand the impact of bioactive compounds from PA used on productivity, metabolism, and health status of finishing lambs.;bioactive compounds | growth promoters | hematological profile | meat composition;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of E. coli and Salmonella spp. strains present in carnivores from Janos Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. These microorganisms had been isolated from a wide range of domestic and free-range animals, including wild carnivores. Fifty-five individuals were sampled, and the presence of Salmonella and E. coli was determined by bacteriological standard methods. Strains isolated were characterized by molecular methods and in vitro infection assays. Eight different species of carnivores were captured, including coyotes (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), desert foxes (Vulpes macrotis), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), hooded skunks (Mephitis macroura), lynxes (Lynx rufus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and badgers (Taxidea taxus). Salmonella spp. and E. coli were isolated from four species of carnivores. Five Salmonella spp. strains were isolated, and their molecular characterization revealed in three of them the presence of fimbrial and virulence genes associated with cell invasion. In vitro evaluation of these strains showed their capability to invade human Hep2 cells. Sixty-one E. coli strains were isolated; different serotypes and phylogroups were observed from these strains.

The present work reviews the importance of demi-embryo reconstitution, after bisection, and the main factors that limit its success in livestock. It is possible to increase its level of adoption if it is possible to increase the efficiency currently obtained with this technique, this can be achieved by making a more precise selection of the embryos subjected to bisection. Embryo quality is one of the most important factors related to the potential to reconstitute into viable demi-embryos after bisection, which can be used with greater reliability in embryo transfer programs.;Demi-embryo reconstitution | Embryo bisection | Embryo development;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

This paper describes a methodology proposed to define potential areas for leak localization in a WDN in real conditions, considering as a tool a computer program based on the Harmony Search evolutionary technique. It uses as a starting point a hydraulic model in Epanet that is representative of the WDN and makes iterative comparisons until the relative error between the measured pressures and those estimated is reduced. Subsequently, an exhaustive search is carried out with a direct search method in the potential. area resulting from the proposed methodology. The results obtained show that with the application of the methodology it is possible to optimize the search space and increase the effectiveness of the location of non-visible leaks and, thus, the physical efficiency of the WDN.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

There is evidence of the interaction between the gut microbiota metabolic regulation, and obesity. The global problem of obesity has prompted the study of new preventive and/or therapeutic proposals. Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is projected as a possible treatment for obesity and its associated comorbidities. The objective of this study is to synthesize the current documentation that exists on the effect in metabolic and clinical parameters produced by FMT in humans with obesity, as well as to make evident the methodology used in FMT. Primary results indicated the existence of significant changes in the composition of gut microbiota and improvement in some metabolic markers such as a decrease in insulin resistance (IR) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), as well as an increase in high-density cholesterol (HDL). Further changed were noted in clinical markers such as the decrease in body mass index and waist circumference. Secondary results supported the need to standardize the experimental design of FMT, starting with establishing the correct selection of donors to determine the long-term follow-up of FMT. In conclusion, even though there is a limited number of studies and a lack of standardization on the methodology to carry out FMT, some positive metabolic associations have been shown, which is why FMT remains a potentially promising option for treatment adjuvant of obesity.;Fecal donors | Fecal microbiota transplant | Metabolic syndrome | Obesity | Obesogenic gut microbiota;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

The B.1.1.7 lineage was first detected in Mexico during December 2020, showing a slow progressive increase in its circulation frequency, which reached its maximum in May 2021 but never became predominant. In this work, we analyzed the patterns of diversity and distribution of this lineage in Mexico using phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses. Despite the reported increase in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 lineage, in most Mexican states, it did not displace cocirculating lineages, such as B.1.1.519, which dominated the country from February to May 2021. Our results show that the states with the highest prevalence of B.1.1.7 were those at the Mexico-U.S. border. An apparent pattern of dispersion of this lineage from the northern states of Mexico toward the center or the southeast was observed in the largest transmission chains, indicating possible independent introduction events from the United States. However, other entry points cannot be excluded, as shown by multiple introduction events.

Evaluation of sex-and hormone-dependent changes in body weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, oxidative stress markers, and alterations in different types of memory in Sprague–Dawley rats fed with a high fat and high fructose (HFHF) diet were evaluated. After 12 weeks of feeding the male and female rats with HFHF, body weight gain, increase in blood pressure, and generation of dyslipidemia compared to the animals fed with chow diet were observed. Regarding memory, it was noted that gonadectomy reverted the effects of HFHF in the 24 h novel object recognition task and in spatial learning/memory analyzed through Morris water maze, males being more affected than females. Nevertheless, gonadectomy did not revert long-term memory impairment in the passive avoidance task induced by HFHF nor in male or female rats. On the other hand, sex-hormone–diet interaction was observed in the plasma concentration of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide. These results suggest that the changes observed in the memory and learning of MetS animals are sex-and hormone-dependent and correlate to an increase in oxidative stress.;memory | metabolic syndrome | orchiectomy | ovariectomy | oxidative stress;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Animal cruelty encompasses any act that causes a non-human animal unnecessary pain or suffering, including negligence, abandonment, abuse, torture, bestiality, and even theriocide. This represents a red flag for society as a whole because people who commit such acts can escalate violence and direct it to other individuals. Animal cruelty and interpersonal violence—as well as other socially undesirable conduct such as bullying, antisocial personality disorder, rape, and serial murder—are closely related, so timely diagnoses of either one can help prevent acts of aggression. It is necessary, therefore, to analyze and try to understand whether there are early indicators that may help identify potentially violent individuals. It is well known that kids from homes with actual violence in their homes show a high tendency to reproduce such behaviors with both animals and other people. In conclusion, much research and rethinking of the importance of the veterinarian in detecting animal abuse and cruelty is needed to help detect and prevent cases of interpersonal violence that may arise over time.;animal cruelty | animal welfare | one welfare | the link | veterinary social work | violence;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Behavior is the expression of several physiological, endocrine, motor and emotional responses that are coordinated by the central nervous system from the processing of internal and external stimuli. In mammals, seven basic emotional systems have been described that when activated by the right stimuli evoke positive or negative innate responses that evolved to facilitate biological fitness. This review describes the process of how those neurobiological systems can directly influence animal welfare. We also describe examples of the interaction between primary (innate) and secondary (learned) processes that influence behavior.;emotions | learning | neurobiology | Panksepp | welfare | well-being;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

We describe the spectrum of clinicopathologic COVID-19-related oral lesions that can be the first and/or the unique manifestation of the disease. Fourteen patients with a mean age of 58 years (range: 23 to 88 y) with oral lesions were included. All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Patients demonstrated mild symptoms, including dysgeusia, anosmia, fever, and headache. The lesions were recognized and classified into 2 groups: (1) lesions caused by ischemia and/or hemorrhage and (2) lesions secondary to inflammatory events associated with viral load. The palate was most affected (n=8), followed by the tongue (n=4), and both the lip and palate (n=2). Histologic analysis demonstrated thrombosis of small arteries and capillaries, associated with areas of hemorrhage and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for spike protein (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the surface epithelium, salivary glands, inflammatory cells, and endothelial cells. Although the incidence of oral lesions among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 appears to be uncommon, these findings suggest that the oral mucosa can also be a target organ for SARS-CoV-2.;COVID-19 | oral lesions | SARS-CoV-2 | thrombosis;3;0;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

This study aimed to assess the effects of a long-term moderate aerobic exercise protocol on bone microarchitecture and fragility associated with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in aging. Male BALB/c mice (n = 10 per group) underwent a moderate exercise protocol from 13 weeks to 27 (adulthood age) or 108 weeks of age (elderly age) and were then sacrificed. Age-match sedentary mice were included as a control group. Serum cortisol concentrations were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay, C-reactive protein (CRP) by a turbidimetric assay, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) by fluorescent spectroscopy, and total glutathione (GSH) by colorimetric method. The right femur was dissected for morphometric and densitometric analysis by computerized microtomography (µCT), and biomechanical properties were assessed using a three-point bending device. Muscle from the same extremity was obtained to determine relative mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) by RT-qPCR. Statistical differences were evaluated by two-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak method post hoc with P < 0.05. In elderly mice, moderate exercise increased glutathione levels and microarchitecture complexity but decreased bone fragility and oxidative stress markers, cortisol, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, these results suggest a strong link between a pro-inflammatory state and age-conditioned oxidative stress on bone quality. Thus, on a human scale, moderate aerobic exercise may improve bone quality during aging.;Aging | Inflammation | Moderate exercise | Oxide-reduction system | Quality bone;0;0;;;CONACYT;176060;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Results: Two patients (40%) survived after three years of follow-up; the log-rank test showed a statistically significant difference in overall survival between both groups (p = 0.032). All patients tolerated the treatment adequately without reporting any severe clinical or neuroradiological adverse effects. Of the patients included, all showed a decrease in the tumor one month after the end of the treatment, although there was great variability in the response and the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Conclusions: Although future investigations are needed to confirm the findings reported in the present study, the improvement in survival is promising for a group of patients whose prognosis has been catastrophic over the years.

Trypanosoma cruzi DTU II molecular evidence was found in heart, intestine, liver, and breast suggesting an established chronic infection based on the parasite DNA presence in multiple organs but absent in spleen, as in the murine model and chronically infected raccoons (Procyon lotor). For birds, the parasite rejection was explained based on the complement and high body temperature, but these mechanisms vary greatly among the members of the avian class. Therefore, there is a need to investigate whether more bird species can become infected, and if T. furcata has a role in disseminating, transmitting and/or maintaining the parasite.";Barn-owl | Trypanosoma cruzi | Tyto alba | Wild host | Wildlife;5;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Among the cell sources, the utilization of mesenchymal cells (MSCs) has gained great interest because these multipotent cells are capable of differentiating into diverse tissues, in addition to their self-renewal capacity to maintain their cell population, thus representing a therapeutic alternative for those diseases that can only be controlled with palliative treatments. This review aimed to summarize the state of the art of the main sources of MSCs as well as particular characteristics of each subtype and applications of MSCs in TE in seven different areas (neural, osseous, epithelial, cartilage, osteochondral, muscle, and cardiac) with a systemic revision of advances made in the last 10 years. It was observed that bone marrow-derived MSCs are the principal type of MSCs used in TE, and the most commonly employed techniques for MSCs characterization are immunodetection techniques. Moreover, the utilization of natural biomaterials is higher (41.96%) than that of synthetic biomaterials (18.75%) for the construction of the scaffolds in which cells are seeded. Further, this review shows alternatives of MSCs derived from other tissues and diverse strategies that can improve this area of regenerative medicine.;Biocompatible materials | Mesenchymal stem cells | Regenerative medicine | Tissue engineering | Tissue therapy;8;0;;;;undefined;

By finding these trends and biases we will be better equipped to modulate them and find avenues that may lead us to a more integrated view of health inequity, potentially enhancing our capabilities to intervene to ameliorate it. In this study, we characterized at a large scale, the social and cultural determinants most frequently reported in current global research of health inequity and the interrelationships among them in different populations under diverse contexts. We used a data/literature mining approach to the current literature followed by a semantic network analysis of the interrelationships discovered. The analyzed structured corpus consisted in circa 950 articles categorized by means of the Medical Subheadings (MeSH) content-descriptor from 2014 to 2021. Further analyses involved systematic searches in the LILACS and DOAJ databases, as additional sources.

Additionally, there is a need to corroborate whether psychological wellbeing contributes to excess weight in indigenous women. Objective. To determine whether there is an association between lifestyle, psychological well-being, and body mass index (BMI) in indigenous women. Materials and methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 110 female Zapotec university students in Juchitán, Oaxaca, Mexico. The Psychological Well-Being Scale, the Healthy Lifestyle Scale for University Students, and a questionnaire about personal data were used. Body weight and height were measured to calculate BMI. Results. There was a negative correlation between BMI, self-acceptance (r = -0.33; p < 0.01), and life appreciation (r = -0.22; p < 0.05). Positive correlations were found between lifestyle and psychological well-being dimensions, with the strongest correlations being observed between life appreciation and purpose in life (r = 0.55) and self-acceptance (r = 0.48).

It is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). In this study, we evaluated the presence of MAP using bacteriological, molecular, and anatomopathological studies, based on the clinical suspicion of PTB in a zoo, in an area housing 10 scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), five giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis), and three blue wildebeests (Connochaetes taurinus). Materials and Methods: From November 2016 to June 2017, fecal samples were collected from individuals of the three species on four occasions, resulting in a total of 56 fecal samples. In addition, five small intestine samples were collected from the necropsies of three adult scimitar-horned oryx females and two oryx calves. MAP identification was performed through isolation in Herrold’s medium with egg yolk, mycobactin, and sodium pyruvate, Ziehl–Neelsen staining, IS900 polymerase chain reaction (IS900 PCR), and anatomopathological examination of intestine samples. Results: Diffuse granulomatous enteritis with abundant acid-fast bacilli was found in two out of five intestine samples from adult scimitar-horned oryx females. MAP was isolated in 7/56 (12.5%) of the fecal samples from four scimitar-horned oryx, one giraffe, and two wildebeest samples. Two out of 5 (40%) samples obtained from scimitar-horned oryx tested positive. IS900 PCR yielded five positive samples (two fecal samples and three small intestine samples). MAP isolates were classified as Type C (Cattle) using type-specific PCR. Conclusion: These results demonstrated the presence of MAP in the area evaluated and indicated the importance of both sampling live animals and conducting postmortem examinations.

There is scarce evidence of the relationship of oral hygiene and nutritional status in patients on Peritoneal Dialysis (PD). Objective: we aimed to assess the relationship of oral hygiene with nutritional, clinical, and physical performance parameters in PD patients. Methods: this cross-sectional study included outpatients aged 34-69 years. Oral health questionnaire, nutritional, functional, and clinical assessment tools such as Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS), Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), handgrip strength, and Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire (GSQ) were applied. Patients were divided according to debris, calculus, and Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S) in two groups: “clean-slightly dirty” and “dirty-very dirty”. Results: in total, 41 patients were included, those in the “dirty-very dirty” group had a worse nutritional status with higher scores on the MIS tool and worse nutritional diagnosis with SGA as compared to the “clean-slightly dirty” group. The handgrip strength was higher in patients in the best category of oral hygiene, and those with the worst hygiene presented greater severity of gastrointestinal symptoms. The risks of malnutrition in the three indices of oral hygiene with the worst category were statistically significant. Conclusion: poor oral hygiene was associated with poorer nutritional status, lower handgrip, and worse GSQ. Poor oral hygiene might be related to persistent inflammation status and catabolism that favored protein-energy wasting.;Oral hygiene | Periodontitis | Peritoneal dialysis | Probiotics | Protein-energy wasting;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;779601;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In this work, we present a model of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which plays a key role in cell cycle regulation and is related to cell survival, proliferation, and growth in cancer, as well as resistance to antitumor therapies, so finding drugs that act on this pathway is ideal to propose a new adjuvant treatment. The aim of this work was to model, simulate and predict in silico using the Big Data-Cellulat platform the possible targets in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway on which the Opuntia joconostle extract acts, as well as to indicate the concentration range to be used to find the mean lethal dose in in vitro experiments on breast cancer cells. The in silico results show that, in a cancer cell, the activation of JAK and STAT, as well as PI3K and Akt is related to the effect of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis, and that the extract of O. joconostle has an antiproliferative effect on breast cancer cells by inhibiting cell proliferation, regulating the cell cycle and inhibiting apoptosis through this signaling pathway. In vitro it was demonstrated that the extract shows an antiproliferative effect, causing the arrest of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of in silico tools is a valuable method to perform virtual experiments and discover new treatments. The use of this type of model supports in vitro experimentation, reducing the costs and number of experiments in the real laboratory.;breast cancer | cell signaling pathways | in silico prediction | in vitro evaluation | Modeling and simulation;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;UAM;undefined;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

However, evidence of the effectiveness of the thermal windows used in dogs and cats is discrepant. This review aims to analyze and discuss the usefulness of IRT in diverse body regions in household animals (pets) related to recent scientific evidence on the use of the facial, body, and appendicular thermal windows. IRT is a diagnostic method that evaluates thermal and circulatory changes under different clinical conditions. For the face, structures such as the lacrimal caruncle, ocular area, and pinna are sensitive to assessments of stress degrees, but only the ocular window has been validated in felines. The usefulness of body and appendicular thermal windows has not been conclusively demonstrated because evidence indicates that biological and environmental factors may strongly influence thermal responses in those body regions. The above has led to proposals to evaluate specific muscles that receive high circulation, such as the biceps femoris and gracilis. The neck area, perivulvar, and perianal regions may also prove to be useful thermal windows, but their degree of statistical reliability must be established. In conclusion, IRT is a non-invasive technique that can be used to diagnose inflammatory and neoplastic conditions early. However, additional research is required to establish the sensitivity and specificity of these thermal windows and validate their clinical use in dogs and cats.;Cats | Dogs | Infrared thermography | Thermal window;9;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The aim of this study is to determine the source of contamination of MP and characterize the corresponding genotypic and phenotypic properties of the strains found. Nose, pharynx, and MP samples were taken from a group of health science students. We were able to determinate the clonality of the isolated strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and spa gene typing (spa-type). Adhesin and toxin genes were detected, and the capacity of biofilm formation was determined. Several of the MP exhibited strains of S. aureus present in the nose and/or pharynx of their owners. methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (HA-MRSA), and community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains were found, which indicated a variety of genotypes.

The objective of this study was to evaluate CR’s effects on metabolic and reproductive parameters in 12-month-old male Wistar rats. The rats were distributed in three groups: control, CR at 15%, and CR at 35% for 6 (up to 18 months of age) and 12 months (up to 24 months of age). At the end of CR treatment, we evaluated reproductive (male sexual behavior (MSB), sperm quality) and biochemical parameters (plasma glucose, glucose-regulating hormone, and sex steroid levels), and quantified annexin V in the seminiferous epithelium. Results showed that MSB and sperm quality were improved after 6 months of CR associated with increases in plasma testosterone and decrease annexin V in the seminiferous epithelium of the testicles compared to their control group. The metabolic profile of the CR rats also improved compared to controls. However, these effects of CR on reproductive parameters were not maintained after 12 months of CR. Findings suggest that beginning CR at the age of maturity reestablishes the behavioral sexual response and reproductive function in older animals after 6 months of CR and improves endocrine functioning during aging.;Calorie restriction | Male sexual behavior | Seminiferous tubules | Testis | Testosterone;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;718777;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It includes a broad literature review emphasizing the most recent and specialized publications examining key findings to improve our understanding in the performance of the buffalo species (Bubalus bubalis). The complementary topics addressed include reproductive management, parturition, the dam–calf bond, milking routines, and models of confinement and management, in addition to aspects related to milk commercialization. This article summarizes the advances made to date in this production system and its current margins for improvement. The development of dual-purpose water buffalo production systems in Mexico’s tropical wetlands is a relatively recent phenomenon that has progressed and improved due to herd management. Buffaloes are an interesting alternative for dual purpose systems that offer several advantages. The lower milk production of this species compared to cattle is its main limitation. However, the properties of their milk allow one to obtain an added value and make this type of farms competitive. In synthesis, consolidating buffalo production in Mexico’s tropical wetlands will require broadening our knowledge of this species, and perfecting the most appropriate handling procedures. The activities of government agencies and processing enterprises will play vital roles in achieving the integral modernization of this potentially important economic activity.;Allosuckling | Bubalus bubalis | Calving | Imprinting | Mexico wetlands;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

There is no universally accepted benchmark on nutrition competencies for doctors. The objective of this study was to establish, by expert consensus, the objectives of undergraduate nutrition medial education, the nutrition core competencies, and strategies for curriculum development in medical nutrition education. Methods: We administered a Delphi survey to systematically gather the opinion of a panel of Latin American experts in nutrition. The survey questionnaire was constructed considering scientific literature by using a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was defined as >70% agreement on the importance of an item (Likert scale 4 and 5). Results: A four-round Delphi survey was conducted for this research. In the second, third, and fourth rounds, we validated a total of 130 competencies by consensus, which were distributed into four different thematic areas: (1) basic nutrition concepts, (2) public nutrition and nutrition prevention throughout the life cycle, (3) nutrition status and disease, and (4) nutrition care process. Conclusion: The curricula for general physician education in medical school must include health promotion, prevention, and treatment of diseases related to nutrition. This goal can be reached by integrating ≤130 competencies into four different fundamental areas.;competencies | education | medicine | nutrition;3;0;;;;undefined;

Short-term HRV time series are of great clinical interest to study autonomic impairments manifested in chronic diseases such as the end stage renal disease (ESRD) and the response of patients to treatment with hemodialysis (HD). In contrast to Iterative Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform (IAAFT), the Pinned Wavelet Iterative Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform (PWIAAFT) surrogates preserve nonstationary behavior in time series, a common characteristic of HRV. We aimed to test synthetic data and HRV time series for the existence of nonlinearity. Recurrence Quantitative Analysis (RQA) indices were used as discriminative statistics in IAAFT and PWIAAFT surrogates of linear stationary and nonstationary processes. HRV time series of healthy subjects and 29 ESRD patients before and after HD were tested in this setting during an active standing test. Contrary to PWIAAFT, linear nonstationary time series may be erroneously regarded as nonlinear according to the IAAFT surrogates. Here, a lower proportion of HRV time series was classified as nonlinear with PWIAAFT, compared to IAAFT, confirming that the nonstationarity condition influences the testing of nonlinear behavior in HRV. A contribution of nonlinearity was found in the HRV data of healthy individuals. A lower proportion of nonlinear time series was also found in ESRD patients, but statistical significance was not found. Although this proportion tends to be lower in ESRD patients, as much as 60% of time series proved to be nonlinear in healthy subjects. Given the important contribution of nonlinearity in HRV data, a nonlinear point of view is required to achieve a broader understanding of cardiovascular physiology.;active standing | heart rate variability | hemodialysis | nonlinear dynamics | nonstationarity | recurrence analysis | surrogate data;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;DGAPA PAPIIT IN216318;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy is the clinical manifestation of hypoxic injury to the brain and is usually graded as mild, moderate, or severe. The search for useful biomarkers to precisely predict the severity of lesions in perinatal asphyxia and hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a field of increasing interest. As pathophysiology is not fully comprehended, the gold standard for treatment remains an active area of research. Hypothermia has proven to be an effective neuroprotective strategy and has been implemented in clinical routine.

They sense and respond to physiological and environmental changes of their host plant and microbiome. The inter-organism interactions are largely driven by chemical networks mediated by specialized metabolites. The balance of these complex interactions leads to healthy and strong host plants. Endophytic strains have particular machinery to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites with a variety of bioactivities and unknown functions in an ecological niche. Terpenoids play a key role in endophytism and represent an important source of bioactive molecules for human health and agriculture. In this review, we describe the role of endophytic fungi in plant health, fungal terpenoids in multiple interactions, and bioactive fungal terpenoids recently reported from endophytes, mainly from plants used in traditional medicine, as well as from algae and mangroves. Additionally, we highlight endophytic fungi as producers of important chemotherapeutic terpenoids, initially discovered in plants. Despite advances in understanding endophytism, we still have much to learn in this field. The study of the role, the evolution of interactions of endophytic fungi and their terpenoids provide an opportunity for better applications in human health and agriculture.;Bioactivity | Chemotherapeutic | Endophytic fungi | Endophytism | Terpenoids;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;375987;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This study aimed to associate temperamental traits and age with behaviour during paediatric dental treatment. This was an observational and cross-sectional study of patients aged 3–10 years. To determine the temperamental traits, an Emotionality Activity and Sociability Temperament Survey (EAS) was performed with the children’s parents. The type of behaviour was determined with Frankl’s criteria. The total scores for temperamental traits, means, and standard deviations were obtained. The chi-squared test, one-way ANOVA and Student’s t-test were applied. A total of 140 patients, who were 5 ± 2.1 years old, participated in the study. Age was determinant for negative behaviour, with a greater frequency in children ≤5 years old (p < 0.05), and a significant negative correlation between age and behaviour (rho = −0.245, p = 0.001). Patients with higher emotionality and activity presented negative and definitely negative behaviours more frequently (p < 0.01). The values for sociability and shyness were similar for positive or negative behaviours. In conclusion, the temperamental traits of emotionality and activity were more frequent in children with disruptive behaviours; therefore, conducting a survey on temperamental traits can be useful for planning behavioural approaches in paediatric dentistry.";Children’s behaviour | Cooperation | Dental treatment | Temperament survey;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;1014264;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The objectives were to obtain a broader profile of this system and capture values related to buffalo breeding in that area. The study identified a group of producers with high levels of education (17 ± 1.15 years) and years of experience i n agricultural systems (28.75 ± 10.81), especially with buffaloes (9 ± 1.83 years). Land tenure is private, and the average surface area of ranches is 428.75 ± 245.57 hectares, located mainly (92%) in flatlands and floodplains with an average number of animals per hectare 2.03 ± 0.69 AU/h. The area has various vegetable strata (grasses, bushes, trees). Feeding is based on the consumption of vegetable species like Camalote grass (Paspalum fasciculatum), West Indian Azuche grass (Hymenachne amplexicaulis), and Aleman grass (Echinochloa polystachya), complemented with minerals. Production units (PU) 2 and 3 add a low proportion of balanced feed. The average number of animals per PU is 611 ± 50. Dams and calves represent the largest proportions in the herds. The main breed raised in these buffalo production systems is Buffalypso (58% ± 21%), followed by Italian Mediterranean (24% ± 5%) and Murrah (10% ± 14%). The data collected show that the reproduction methods most often utilized, in order of frequency, are fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI), direct mounting (DM), and estrus-detected artificial insemination (EDAI). Proportions are 61% ± 18%, 24% ± 25% and 14% ± 17%, respectively. The DPBPS studied are distinguished by the presence of owners and managers with high levels of education, extensive experience in agricultural systems, and the capacity and willingness to implement new technologies that permit continuous improvement. However, their experience in buffalo production is still limited, so there is ample room for improvement.;Bubalus bubalis | production system | River buffalo | tropical wetlands;1;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

This study aims to explore novel 4D-flow MRI parametric voxel-by-voxel forward flow, reverse flow, kinetic energy and stasis in BAV disease. We hypothesize that novel parametric voxel-by-voxel markers will be associated with aortic dilation and referral for surgery and can enhance our understanding of BAV hemodynamics beyond standard metrics. Methods: A total of 96 subjects (73 BAV patients, 23 healthy controls) underwent MRI scan. Healthy controls had no known cardiovascular disease. Patients were clinically referred for AAo dilation assessment. Indexed diameters were obtained by dividing the aortic diameter by the patient’s body surface area. Patients were followed for the occurrence of aortic surgery. 4D-flow analysis was performed by a single observer in five regions: left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), AAo, arch, proximal descending aorta (PDAo), and distal descending aorta (DDAo). In each region peak velocity, kinetic energy (KE), forward flow (FF), reverse flow (RF), and stasis were measured on a voxel-by-voxel basis. T-tests (or non-parametric equivalent) compared flow parameters between cohorts. Univariate and multivariate analyses explored associations between diameter and parametric voxel-by-voxel parameters. Results: Compared to controls, BAV patients showed reduced stasis (p < 0.01) and increased RF and FF (p < 0.01) throughout the aorta, and KE remained similar. In the AAo, indexed diameter correlated with age (R = 0.326, p = 0.01), FF (R = −0.648, p < 0.001), RF (R = −0.441, p < 0.001), and stasis (R = −0.288, p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, FF showed a significant inverse association with AAo indexed diameter, independent of age. During a median 179 ± 180 days of follow-up, 23 patients (32%) required aortic surgery. Compared to patients not requiring surgery, they showed increased KE and peak velocity in the proximal aorta (p < 0.01), accompanied by increased RF and reduced stasis throughout the entire aorta (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Novel voxel-by-voxel reverse flow and stasis were altered in BAV patients and are associated with aortic dilation and surgical treatment.;4D-flow imaging | bicuspid aortc valve | flow stasis | kinetic energy | parametric mapping | reverse flow;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;NIA;DGECR-2020-00204;National Institute on Aging

We performed gene-based association testing of blood lipid levels with rare (minor allele frequency < 1%) predicted damaging coding variation by using sequence data from >170,000 individuals from multiple ancestries: 97,493 European, 30,025 South Asian, 16,507 African, 16,440 Hispanic/Latino, 10,420 East Asian, and 1,182 Samoan. We identified 35 genes associated with circulating lipid levels; some of these genes have not been previously associated with lipid levels when using rare coding variation from population-based samples. We prioritize 32 genes in array-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci based on aggregations of rare coding variants; three (EVI5, SH2B3, and PLIN1) had no prior association of rare coding variants with lipid levels. Most of our associated genes showed evidence of association among multiple ancestries. Finally, we observed an enrichment of gene-based associations for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol drug target genes and for genes closest to GWAS index single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our results demonstrate that gene-based associations can be beneficial for drug target development and provide evidence that the gene closest to the array-based GWAS index SNP is often the functional gene for blood lipid levels.";association | cholesterol | exome sequencing | gene-based association | lipid;7;1;repositoryam;Green;NHLBI;R01HL127564;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

Due to the complex demographic history of Latin America and the lack of balanced representation of Native American genomes in current imputation panels, the discovery of locally relevant disease variants is likely to be missed, limiting the scope and impact of biomedical research in these populations. Therefore, the necessity of better diversity representation in genomic databases is a scientific imperative. Here, we expand the 1,000 Genomes reference panel (1KGP) with 134 Native American genomes (1KGP + NAT) to assess imputation performance in Latin American individuals of mixed ancestry. Our panel increased the number of SNPs above the GWAS quality threshold, thus improving statistical power for association studies in the region. It also increased imputation accuracy, particularly in low-frequency variants segregating in Native American ancestry tracts. The improvement is subtle but consistent across countries and proportional to the number of genomes added from local source populations. To project the potential improvement with a higher number of reference genomes, we performed simulations and found that at least 3,000 Native American genomes are needed to equal the imputation performance of variants in European ancestry tracts. This reflects the concerning imbalance of diversity in current references and highlights the contribution of our work to reducing it while complementing efforts to improve global equity in genomic research.;GWAS | Imputation | Latin Americans | Native American ancestry | reference panels | underrepresented populations;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;ICGEB;CN-19-29;University of Chicago

The role of dietary eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids in this relationship is unknown. Aim: To investigate the association of EPA and DHA with PAI-1 and resistin, as well as the role of this association on the glucose metabolism of apparently healthy subjects. Subjects and methods: Thirty-six healthy individuals were included. Validated food frequency questionnaires were used to analyse dietary habits. Inflammatory and glucose metabolism markers were quantified. Subcutaneous AT samples were obtained, and adipocyte number, area, and macrophage content were assessed. Results: In 36 subjects aged 56 ± 8 years and with a body mass index of 26 ± 4 kg/m2, logEPA, and logDHA showed significant association with logresistin and a marginal association with PAI-1. Adipocyte number, area, and lognumber of macrophages per adipocyte significantly correlated with PAI-1 but not with logresistin. Although logEPA and logDHA were independently associated with loginsulin, loginsulin resistance, and C-Peptide, the addition of logresistin, but not of PAI-1, into the multivariable model, abolished the associations. Conclusions: EPA and DHA could modulate glucose metabolism across AT functional states. Our data indicate that this association is independent of other metabolic risk factors.;adipose tissue | docosahexaenoic fatty acid | Eicosapentaenoic fatty acid | plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 | resistin;0;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Case reports and case series of SOT were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Twenty-eight studies comprising 30 cases of SOTs were included. Considering all cases published, SOTs mostly occurred simultaneously in the maxilla and mandible (n = 19/63.3%). Lesions were bifocal in 13 (43.3% of all the 30 cases) and multifocal in 17 cases (56.7% of all the 30 cases). All SOTs available in the literature presented the same type of lesion, and two of them also involved another different SOT (n = 2/6.7% of all the 30 cases). Out of all published cases, the most frequent SOTs in the literature were odontomas (n = 10/33.3% of all the 30 cases), squamous odontogenic tumors (OTs) (n = 8/26.7% of all the 30 cases), calcifying epithelial OTs (n = 8/26.7% of all the 30 cases), and adenomatoid OTs (n = 2/6.7% of all the 30 cases). Considering all SOTs cases included, the overall recurrence was 13.3%. Inside a subgroup of the lesion, synchronous calcifying epithelial OT presented the highest (25%). Five cases (16.7% of all the 30 cases) had a previously associated syndrome, with two cases of Schimmelpenning syndrome being reported. Among published SOTs, odontomas were the most common. All SOTs available in the scientific literature showed the same type of OT and mainly affected both jaws simultaneously.

The current hypothesis regarding the cause of infertility is that sperm are highly sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) during spermatogenesis in the testes and transit through the epididymides, so the increase in ROS brought on by obesity could cause oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the activity of the enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) is capable of counteracting oxidative stress in sperm. The male Wistar rat was used as an overweight and obesity model, and analysis of fertility in these groups was carried out including the control group. Serum testosterone levels were determined, and the scrotal fat, testes, and epididymides were extracted. The epididymides were separated ini0 3 principal parts (caput, corpus, and cauda) before evaluating sperm viability, sperm morphology, damage to desoxyribonucleic acid of the sperm, and ROS production. The protein content and specific activity of the three enzymes mentioned above were evaluated. Results showed a gain in body weight and scrotal fat in the overweight and obese groups with decreased parameters for serum testosterone levels and sperm viability and morphology. Fertility was not greatly affected and no DNA integrity damage was found, although ROS in the epididymal sperm increased markedly and Raman spectroscopy showed a disulfide bridge collapse associated with DNA. The specific activities of CAT and GPX increased in the overweight and obesity groups, but those of SOD did not change. The amounts of proteins in the testes and epididymides decreased. These findings confirm that overweight and obesity decrease concentrations of free testosterone and seem to decrease protein content, causing poor sperm quality. Implications. An increase in scrotal fat in these conditions fosters an increase of ROS, but the increase of GPX and CAT activity seems to avoid oxidative stress increase in the sperm without damaging your DNA.;;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Ruminants represent a model for studying the effects of ED in humans due to some similarities in their development. Ruminants are considered of great importance due to continuous exposure to pasture and contaminated soils and human consumption of their meat. The present review aims to describe ED effects in ruminants’ reproduction, when they are consumed in the perinatal, postnatal-pre-adulthood, and adult stages. Feeding with phytoestrogens (PE) rich forage has no nocive consequences on the male reproductive system at any stages of life; in females, they produce more significant harmful effects when administered in adulthood. In the perinatal and postnatal-pre-adulthood stages, negative effects of synthetic ED were found in both males and females.

Enterprises need to respond quickly to the needs of their customers and stakeholders and by adopting agile practices in IT teams, business value is raised in both performance and quality, so it is important to adopt practices and models that ensure the time, scope and cost of a project are achieved successfully. This paper presents a hybrid effort estimation model that uses a story point approach with machine learning techniques to estimate completion time and total cost of a project that is developed with agile methods like Scrum. The main machine learning technique used to implement the project is the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN), its learning capabilities are assessed through 10-Fold cross validation and the estimates are compared with the original dataset and the results obtained from literature to show that estimates are competitive. The proposed approach uses category size labels that improve the original estimation model based on linear regression. The research uses 21 projects developed by six software houses, and training is done on a set created from a technique called data augmentation that generates 42 projects with a small amount of noise. Completion time is measured in days and total cost is valued in Pakistan rupees. All the results are evaluated through accuracy, Mean Squared Error, Mean Relative Error, variance and coefficient of determination.;cost | Effort | estimation | KNN | machine learning | supervised | time;0;0;;;;undefined;

However, those related to insomnia associated with mood disorders remain understudied, even though insomnia is more severe in the presence of comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to determine the direct and indirect costs of insomnia associated with depression and anxiety disorders (DAD) from the perspective of the patient in a private healthcare system. This was an observational study of chronic insomnia associated with DAD at a private Sleep Disorders Clinic in Mexico City between 2019 and 2020. Patients were followed for up to one year. Healthcare resource utilization data were collected through clinical records. Direct and indirect costs associated with insomnia treatment were estimated through micro-costing. The estimated economic burden was projected to 5 years adjusting for inflation and discounting future costs. A deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed. The median cost of the first year of insomnia treatment associated with DAD was US$3537.57 per patient. The work productivity loss represented the highest economic burden (63.84%) followed by direct medical costs (28.32%), and the direct non-medical costs (7.85%). The estimated annual economic burden for patients treated in the private healthcare system in Mexico was US$293 million. The costs of insomnia associated with DAD at a private clinic in México were found to be high. The burden of the costs faced by these patients is substantial relative to the median income of the population.

Methodology: Equilibrium solubility tests were carried out to prepare formulations with the excipients, in which indomethacin presented a greater increase in solubility; the systems were characterized by self-emulsification time, physical stability, particle size, zeta potential, dissolution profiles and permeation through synthetic membrane. Results: The experimental design of self-emulsifying delivery systems allowed to create formulations that increase the solubility of indomethacin in an order of 105 times with respect to the aqueous solubility. The feasible formulations presented autoemulsification times less than 60 seconds, in addition, the particle size distributions of the dispersions were less than 300 nm, with polydispersity index smaller than 0.3, and zeta potential values lower than -25 mV. The dissolution profiles showed that the formulations comply with a similarity factor value greater than 50, in addition, the permeability through a synthetic membrane is higher for the selfemulsifying formulations than the reference product. Conclusion: The formulation of indomethacin into self-emulsifying delivery systems enhances the solubility in aqueous medium, increases dissolution and accelerate release.

This family of receptors recognizes and mediates the action of several endogenous ligands (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors and local hormones) and also intervenes in the pathogenesis of various diseases, which is why they are targeted by approximately 30 to 40% of medications that are used in daily clinical practice and of various illegal drugs as well. X-ray crystallography is one of the essential tools that has allowed to observe the structure of these receptors in the amino acids that participate in this interaction, which allows to know the binding site of the endogenous ligand and of synthetic molecules that act on them to modulate their action. Molecular modeling or ""docking"" is also a computational bioinformatics tool that supports research on receptor-ligand binding, which allows the design and development of increasingly specific drugs.

However, is unknown whether this METy can be different when measured resting energy expenditure (REE) is used. The purposes of this article are to: (a) To determine whether there is equivalence between METy values calculated using measured REE (METy-mea) and METy using predicted BMR (METy-est). (b) To determine whether METy values of different activities are dependent on age, sex, and body composition. Methods: A cross-sectional study with a sample of 122 Mexican children (5–11 years old) was conducted. With indirect calorimetry, energy expenditure was measured at rest and during 16 sedentary- to vigorous-intensity physical activities. METy were obtained in two forms: METy-mea and METy-est. Equivalence testing was used to compare METy-mea and METy-est. To examine the individual-level agreement, Bland-Altman plots were graphed, and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. Linear regression models were estimated having METy as the outcome. Results: For 15 activities, there was equivalence between METy-mea and METy-est (t > 2.05, p < 0.050). However, at the individual-level, for 7 activities the agreement between METy-eREE and METy-mREE was inadequate (ICC<0.75). In the Bland-Altman plots was evident that in 8 activities METy-est was biased compared to METy-mea, METy-est had more correlations with body mass index and body fat. Conclusions: In conclusion, at group-level, for most activities METy-mea and METy-est were equivalent. However, at the individual level, METy-est of many activities is not a valid estimate of METy-mea. METy-est of many physical activities were dependent on adiposity, which could be an artifact introduced when BMR is predicted.   .;Child | energy expenditure | exercise | metabolic equivalent | physical activity | sedentary behavior;0;0;;;;undefined;

Methods: Patients (n = 17) diagnosed with sleep apnea or primary snoring were included in this study and subsequently treated with MADs. Changes were assessed using a polysomnographic study (PSG), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and an imaging study with computed tomography scanning (CT). Studies were performed before and after the use of MAD. Anteroposterior measurements were taken in the sagittal plane at the hard palate, glottis, and supraglottic levels along the hard palate axis. Afterward, measurements were taken in the axial plane at the same levels along the hard palate axis. Results: From the six recorded measurements, the airway caliber increased by five. However, these changes were significant only in two measurements (sagittal hard palate and axial supraglottic). Snoring was controlled in 16 of the 17 subjects. From these sixteen, 12 subjects had a correct opening of the airway at the hard palate level. Moreover, daytime sleepiness decreased in all subjects. Discussion: Present results suggest that sagittal hard palate and axial supraglottic opening after use of MAD are mainly responsible for eliminating snoring and improve sleep apnea.;Mandibular Advance Device | Primary Snoring | Sleep Apnea | sleep disorder;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;2013-1-201587;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The inhibition of Aβ aggregation has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for AD. Pristine C60 has shown the capacity to interact with the Aβ peptide and interfere with fibril formation but induces significant toxic effects in vitro and in vivo. Objective: To evaluate the potential of a series of C60 multiadducts to inhibit the Aβ fibrillization. Methods: A series of C60 multiadducts with four to six diethyl malonyl and their corresponding disodium-malonyl substituents were synthesized as individual isomers. Their potential on Aβ fibrillization inhibition was evaluated in vitro, in cellulo, and silico. Antioxidant activity, acetylcholinesterase inhibition capacity, and toxicity were assessed in vitro. Results: The multiadducts modulate Aβ fibrils formation without inducing cell toxicity, and that the number and polarity of the substituents play a significant role in the adducts efficacy to modulate Aβ aggregation. The molecular mechanism of fullerene-Aβ interaction and modulation was identified. Furthermore, the fullerene derivatives exhibited antioxidant capacity and reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity. Conclusion: Multiadducts of C60 are novel multi-target-directed ligand molecules that could hold considerable promise as the starting point for the development of AD therapies.;Alzheimer's disease | fullerenes | molecular dynamics | nanoparticles | polymerization | therapy;1;0;;;CONACYT;319328;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

To evaluate the association between life-course leisure-time physical activity (PA) and prostate cancer (PC) among males living in Mexico City. Materials and methods. Information from 394 incident PC cases and 794 population controls matched by age (± 5 years), was analyzed. Using leisure-time PA information at different life stages, life-course PA patterns were constructed. The association between PA and PC was estimated using an unconditional logistic regression model. Results. Three life-course PA patterns were identified: low PA (71.0%), moderate PA (22.0%), and high PA (7.0%); this last pattern was characterized by higher levels and consistent PA practice. Compared with inactive males, those in the high PA pattern (OR: 0.50; 95%CI: 0.26-0.93) had significantly lower PC odds. Conclusion. Intense and regular PA could reduce the possibility of PC. These results are in accordance with PA World Health Organization recommendations.";actividad física | cáncer de próstata | life-course | METs | METS | Mexico | México | patrones | physical activity | prostate cancer;1;1;;;CONACYT;140482;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Perinatal asphyxia is one of the main causes of mortality worldwide and is an important factor in triggering physio-metabolic disorders that result in serious neurological consequences and learning disorders not only in human foetuses and neonates, but also in animals. In recent years, the search for new pharmacological protocols to prevent and reverse physio-metabolic disorders and brain damage derived from perinatal asphyxia has been and continues to be the subject of intense research. Currently, within these pharmacological protocols, therapeutic strategies have been evaluated that use respiratory and hormonal stimulants, as well as hypothermic therapies in combination with other putative neuroprotective agents. Similarly, energy supplements have been evaluated with the objective of preventing perinatal asphyxia and treating new-borns with this condition, and to decrease the incidence of neonatal and foetal deaths associated with it. However, despite these promising advances, this pathology has persisted, since the administration of these therapies in low doses may not exert a neuroprotective effect or, in high doses, can trigger adverse effects (such as reduced cardiac contractility, reduced cerebral blood flow, poor perfusion, sympathetic and neuroendocrine stimulation, and increased blood viscosity) in human foetuses and neonates as well as in different animal models (rats, piglets, sheep and rabbits). Therefore, it is important to determine the minimum effective dose with which these therapies exert a neuroprotective effect, as well as the mode of administration, the duration of therapy, etc. Therefore, until a powerful strategy is found to improve the consequences of suffocation, this topic will continue to be the subject of intensive research in the future.;hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy | neonatal mortality | perinatal asphyxia;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

In Mexico, at least eight Leptospira serogroups are known to affect sheep, but little is known about their distribution. The aim was to analyse the spatial distribution of seroreactive sheep to eight serogroups of Leptospira spp. through ecological niche modelling from the state of Veracruz. We carried out a cross-sectional, multistage, and stratified epidemiological study, sampling 405 sheep in different regions of the state (north, center, and south). The sera were analysed using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) to identify seropositivity to eight Leptospira serogroups (Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pyrogenes, Grippotyphosa, Canicola, Pomona, Hardjo, Wolffi, and Tarassovi). Management variables in the sampled herds were evaluated through a survey among the producers, which was analysed using the chi-squared test for cross-tabulation. Geospatial modelling was conducted using MAXENT and 19 climatic variables, and validation was carried out using the area under the curve (AUC). No positive animals were found for Pomona in any area of Veracruz, and there was only one case of seroreactivity to Grippotyphosa. The total seroprevalence found was 53.83% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.84–58.75). The main serogroup found was Sejroe (55.31%, 95% CI 50.32-60.20%), followed by Canicola (8.64%, 95% CI 6.17-11.92%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (4.69%, 95% CI 2.93-7.36%), Tarassovi (3.95%, 95% CI 2.35-6.47%), Pyrogenes (2.47%, 95% CI 1.26-4.64%), Australis (0.99%, 95% CI 0.32-2.69%), and Grippotyphosa (0.25%, 95% CI 0.01-1.59%). The predictive model for Australis was not significant. Acceptable predictive models (AUC > 0.7-0.8) were found for Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pyrogenes, and Tarassovi, while for Sejroe, it was excellent (AUC > 0.85); consequently, the climatic variables that most contributed to the model were those related to precipitation. The potential distribution of Pyrogenes, Icterohaemorrhagiae, and Canicola was located to a greater extent in the three regions; Pyrogenes and Tarassovi were distributed mostly in the north and central regions, and Sejroe was mostly located in the center and south of the state. Ecological niche modelling could support epidemiological control and surveillance programs for affected sheep herds in the state of Veracruz.";animal health | disease distribution | leptospirosis | Ovis orientalis | spatial analysis;0;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Recently, murine lungs have been shown to be a significant source of hematopoietic progenitors in a process known as extramedullary hematopoiesis. Using multiparametric flow cytometry, we have identified mesenchymal, endothelial, and hematopoietic progenitor cells that express the secreted small protein Isthmin 1 (ISM1). Further characterization of hematopoietic progenitor cells indicated that ISM1+ Lineage- Sca-1+ c-kit+ (ISM1+ LSK) cells are enriched in short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs). Moreover, most Sca-1+ ISM1+ cells express the residence marker CD49a, and this correlated with their localization in the extravascular region of the lung, indicating that ISM1+ cells are lung-resident cells. We also observed that ISM1+ cells express TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9, and, in a mouse model of sepsis induced by P. aeruginosa, we observed that all the LSK and ISM1+LSK cells were affected. We conclude that ISM1 is a novel biomarker associated with progenitor-like cells. ISM1+ cells are involved in the response to a bacterial challenge, suggesting an association between ISM1-producing cells and dangerous inflammatory responses like sepsis.;;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Early diagnosis of syphilis, a disease that has increased in recent decades, is essential for adequate management, particularly in people living with HIV (PLWH). This study aimed to comprehensively characterize oral secondary syphilis in a group of 47 PLWH. A group of PLWH with oral secondary syphilis attending four HIV-referral centers in Mexico City was included (2004–2021). Clinical and laboratory data were retrieved, and an exhaustive oral examination was performed following the established criteria. Demographic, clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and serological features of the patients were analyzed. Approximately 11% of PLWH with oral secondary syphilis demonstrated negative Venereal Disease Research Laboratory tests. A noticeable feature was the absence of symptoms in 95.7% of cases, despite the clinically evident appearance of the lesions. In contrast to previous results, 18% of ulcerations were detected to be deep, crateriform, and infiltrative, and 22% of the mucous patches were highly keratotic lesions. Most samples (77.3%) showed superficial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the superficial lamina propria, with perivascular and perineural patterns, and immunohistochemistry was positive in 66.7% of the cases. The ""great imitator"" appears not only clinically but also histopathologically and immunohistochemically, where features may be comparable with those of chronic inflammatory processes, deep infections, or malignant processes. Although not recommended as a routine assay, IHC could be a critical tool, particularly in PLWH with atypical clinical features or with negative and/or dubious serology.";AIDS | Diagnosis | FTA-abs | HIV | Oral lesions | PCR | Secondary syphilis | VDRL;0;0;;;;undefined;

Methods: five waves of a Mexican cross-sectional survey were analyzed to identify changes in food, energy, and nutrient supplies in householdsFood groups were created using the NOVA classification. The content of energy and nutrients was estimated using Mexican and U.S. databasesThe education and income interaction with energy and nutritional supply was analyzed. Results: in this period, the supply of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, processed meat and dairy, fish and seafood, prepared food, and ultra-processed food and drinks increased, whereas unprocessed or minimally processed (UMP) cereals and tubers, legumes, meat, dairy, eggs, and all processed culinary ingredients decreased. These changes have implied a higher supply of protein, total fat, cholesterol, vitamins A and C, calcium and sodium. Total energy, energy density, carbohydrates, and magnesium and potassium density decreased. Across waves, UMP and processed cereals were the main supply for energy, carbohydrates, fiber, iron and potassium. Dairy was the main supply of saturated fat. UMP and processed cereals were the main source of sodium in 1984, whereas ultra-processed cereals were the main source of sodium in 2018. Conclusions: although UMP foods remain the main group in most Mexican households, their supply has decreased over the years, whereas the supply of ultra-processed foods has increased.;;2;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

It is also a drug traditionally used in dermatological therapies due to its anti-inflammatory effect. In recent years its antioxidant, antiexcitotoxic, and antiapoptotic effects have been described in different ischemic damage models, traumatic damage, and models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Finally, dapsone has proven to be a safe and effective drug as a protector against heart, renal and pulmonary cells damage; that is why it is now employed in clinical trials with patients as a neuroprotective therapy by regulating the main mechanisms of damage that lead to cell death. Objective: The objective of this study is to provide a descriptive review of the evidence demonstrating the safety and therapeutic benefit of dapsone treatment, evaluated in animal studies and various human clinical trials Methods: We conducted a review of PubMed databases looking for scientific research in animals and humans, oriented to demonstrate the effect of dapsone on regulating and reducing the main mechanisms of damage that lead to cell death.

The reported effect of aerobic expression of Vitreoscilla haemoglobin (VHb) in different organisms are revised. The use of VHb to reduce overflow metabolism is proposed and studied through flux balance analysis in E. coli at a fixed maximum substrate and oxygen uptake rates. Simulations showed that the presence of VHb increases the growth rate, while decreasing acetate production, in line with the experimental measurements. Therefore, aerobic VHb expression is considered a potential tool to reduce overflow metabolism in cells.;Flux balance analysis | Overflow metabolism | P/O ratio | Vitreoscilla haemoglobin;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The aim is to better understand the functionality of these receptors and their role in maintaining the temperature of animals, or those susceptible to thermal stress. The majority of peripheral receptors are TRP cation channels formed from transmembrane proteins that function as transductors through changes in the membrane potential. TRP are classified into seven families and two groups. The data gathered for this review include controversial aspects because we do not fully know the mechanisms that operate the opening and closing of the TRP gates. Deductions, however, suggest the intervention of mechanisms related to G protein-coupled receptors, dephosphorylation, and ligands. Several questions emerge from the review as well. For example, the future uses of these data for controlling thermoregulatory disorders and the invitation to researchers to conduct more extensive studies to broaden our understanding of these mechanisms and achieve substantial advances in controlling fever, hyperthermia, and hypothermia.;Ion channels | Mammals | Thermoregulation | TRP;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Therefore, maternal and neonatal outcomes may not be the same. This paper aimed to analyze the association between pregestational BMI (pBMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) with maternal and neonatal outcomes in adolescent and adult pregnant women. The authors performed an observational study that included 1112 women, where 52.6% (n = 585) were adolescents. Sociodemographic information, pBMI, GWG, neonatal anthropometric measures, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were obtained. Adolescent women had a mean lower (21.4 vs. 26.2, p ≤ 0.001) pBMI than adults and a higher gestational weight gain (12.3 vs. 10.7 kg, p ≤ 0.001). According to Poisson regression models, gestational diabetes is positively associated with insufficient GWG and with pregestational obesity. Furthermore, the probability of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension increased with pBMI of obesity compared to normal weight. Preeclampsia, anemia, and preterm birth were not associated with GWG. Insufficient GWG was a risk factor, and being overweight was a protective factor for low birth weight and small for gestational age. We conclude that pBMI, GWG, and age group were associated only with gestational diabetes and low birth weight.;Adolescent pregnancy | Anemia | Mexico | Perinatal outcomes | Preeclampsia;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;A3-S-40575;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It is an endemic disease in swine production in the central region of Mexico and causes nervous signs and high mortality in suckling pigs, pneumonia in growing pigs, orchitis in boars and mummification during gestation. PRV hemagglutinates most red blood cells (RBCs) of domestic species. For serological diagnosis, the hemagglutination inhibition test is used, and in this test, guinea pig, bovine and chicken RBCs have been commonly used. In this investigation, hemagglutination with PRV was evaluated using the RBCs of seven domestic species (chicken, bovine, horse, pig, dog, guinea pig and rabbit). In the hemagglutination test, the following parameters were evaluated: temperature (25 °C and 37 °C), bottoms of the wells (V and U), erythrocyte concentration (0.5%, 0.75%, and 1%), and reading time (15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min). Significant differences (P < 0.001) were found in most of the evaluated treatments. The best hemagglutination results were obtained with chicken, bovine and horse RBCs. The hemagglutination titer is higher (2 dilutions) when using chicken RBCs than when using bovine or horse RBCs. If chicken RBCs are used in the inhibition of hemagglutination, the test will be more sensitive, while it is more specific when bovine or horse RBCs are used. The hemagglutination readings are imprecise when using RBCs from dogs, pigs, guinea pigs and rabbits. RBCs from these species should not be used for the diagnosis or investigation of PRV.;Blue eye disease | Diagnosis | Hemagglutinating activity | Porcine orthorubulavirus;0;0;;;;IT-201918;

Research on the distribution, sale, and consumption of these substances is scarce and mostly focuses on men, which limits the understanding of their use and possible public policies. Our ethnographic research concentrates on women who live and work on the street under marginalized conditions in Mexico City. Methods: A Grounded Theory approach was used to frame the two-year-long field work. A field diary was kept for the multi-sited ethnography and participant observations in street-based settings, as well as five in-depth interviews with female distributors, sellers, and/or users of inhalants. Data was analyzed based on four dimensions: biography, representation as a dealer or user, social dynamics, and geographical distribution of networks to distribute, sell, and use inhalants. Results: Women involved in the distribution, sale and use of inhalants are motivated by gender violence and socioeconomic vulnerability. They shape reciprocity networks to purchase inhalants in dangerous urban areas and avoid being mugged and physically or sexually assaulted. Although men are the ones who offer protection, women employ women to sell the inhalants and strengthen trust in the community. Distribution begins in clandestine places where combinations of unknown solvents are prepared in 20-L containers. Each liter is supplied for 1.92 USD to be retailed in 9.58 USD per liter in the streets. Particular language and cultural street-codes are necessary conditions in distribution and sales points for safe use and protection from authorities and out-group members. Conclusion: Trust and cooperation are crucial in reciprocity networks formed by women who distribute, sell and use inhalants in the streets. These networks compensate for the lack of social security and safety, empower women in the street community, and provide income needed to survive marginality.;Cooperation | Inhalants | Reciprocity networks | Street | Trust | Women;0;0;;;;undefined;

We considered that the first 3 months are crucial to understand how knowledge has been generated by performing a bibliometric analysis, including the citations to these articles to guide researchers in exploring this field, and to evaluate the relationship between confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths with the number of papers per country. METHODS: Scientific publications were obtained from PubMed (January-March 2020) and their citations during the first 6 months retrieved from the Scopus database. An analysis of the number of papers by country, approach (type and category of publication), and impact was made. A multiple linear regression model was implemented to analyze the correlation between the number of publications and confirmed cases and deaths. RESULTS: A total of 2,530 publications were analyzed with 59,104 citations (23.4 citations/article), written by authors from 67 countries. China was the country with more publications (988, 39%) and more citations (36,416, 63%) followed by the United States with 423 articles (16.7%) and 7,458 citations (12.6%). The coauthorship network identified 10,756 authors. According to the multivariate analysis, both confirmed cases and deaths were significantly correlated with the number of publications per country (corrected by population size and gross domestic product). CONCLUSION: The correlation with the number of publications suggests that cases and deaths had some impact on the medical literature, reflecting how rapidly the scientific community has been on the frontline in the fight against COVID-19.;Bibliometrics | Coronavirus | COVID-19 | Pandemic | SARS-CoV-2;13;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Alterations in either one of these parameters have been shown to trigger physiological changes that can compromise the welfare of the species and the replicability and robustness of the results obtained. Due to the nature and complexity of evaluating and managing the species involved in research protocols, non‐invasive tools such as infrared thermography (IRT) have been adopted to quantify these parameters without altering them or inducing stress responses in the animals. IRT technology makes it possible to quantify changes in surface temperatures that are derived from alterations in blood flow that can result from inflammatory, stressful, or pathological processes; changes can be measured in diverse regions, called thermal windows, according to their specific characteristics. The principal body regions that were employed for this purpose in laboratory animals were the orbital zone (regio orbitalis), auricular pavilion (regio auricularis), tail (cauda), and the interscapular area (regio scapularis). However, depending on the species and certain external factors, the sensitivity and specificity of these windows are still subject to controversy due to contradictory results published in the available literature. For these reasons, the objectives of the present review are to discuss the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in vasomotor responses and thermogenesis via BAT in laboratory animals and to evaluate the scientific usefulness of IRT and the thermal windows that are currently used in research involving laboratory animals.";Infrared thermography | Laboratory animals | Thermal windows;10;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Clinical medicine considers thermoreg-ulation a mechanism that allows animals to adapt to varying thermal environmental conditions, a process in which the presence of feathers, hair, or glabrous skin influences heat loss or heat retention, respectively, under hot and cold environmental conditions. Evaluating body temperature provides vital information on an individual’s physiological state and health status since variations in euther-mia maintenance in vertebrates reflect a significant cellular metabolism deviation that needs to be assessed and quantified. IRT is a non-invasive tool for evaluating thermal responses under thermal stress conditions in animals, where the presence or absence of feathers, hair, and glabrous skin can affect readings and the differences detected. Therefore, anatomical regions, the characteristics of feathers, hair, glabrous skin such as structure, length, color, and extension, and strategies for dissipating or retaining heat together constitute a broad area of opportunity for future research into the phenomena of dermal thermoregulation in domestic species.;Behavior | Birds | Feathers | Glabrous skin | Hair | Skin | Thermoregulation;15;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Coyotes (Canis latrans) and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) are two canid species that are widely distributed, in Mexico, and they are sympatric throughout most of their distribution range. However, trophic dynamic and overlap between them have not been thoroughly studied. In order to better understand their ecological relationship and potential competitive interactions, we studied the trophic niche overlap between both canids in a temperate forest of Durango, Mexico. The results are based on the analysis of 540 coyote and 307 gray fox feces collected in 2018. Both species consumed a similar range of food items, but the coyote consumed large species while the gray fox did not. For both species, the most frequently consumed food categories throughout the year and seasonally were fruit and wild mammals (mainly rodents and lagomorphs). Coyotes had higher trophic diversity in their annual diet (H' = 2.33) than gray foxes (H' = 1.80). When analyzing diets by season, trophic diversity of both species was higher in winter and spring and tended to decrease in summer and autumn. When comparing between species, this parameter differed significantly during all seasons except for summer. Trophic overlap throughout the year was high (R0 = 0.934), with seasonal variation between R0 = 0.821 (autumn) and R0 = 0.945 (spring). Both species based their diet on the most available food items throughout each season of the year, having high dietary overlap which likely can lead to intense exploitative competition processes.

The number of treatments performed in Latin America has been increasing, and Mexico is the third country with the most assisted reproduction cycles performed in the region. However, Mexico lacks a national regulation for assisted reproduction. Therefore, it is necessary to implement regulations that allow for a safe clinical practice based on ethics which can be available to any social group. Main body: The aim of this review was to examine the existing legislation that regulates human assisted reproduction practices in Mexico, but also to examine the legal analysis of the policies, laws, and regulations in effect in some countries in Latin America, North America, and Europe. For this, seven databases were consulted, and 34 articles from 2004 to 2021 referring to the practice of ART within the legal framework and the anthropological analysis that this entails were analyzed. Eight documents were also consulted such as the Mexican General Health Law of the Official Journal of the Federation (February 7, 1984) with its last published reform (DOF 01-06-2021). And three official agency websites were also consulted. No specific legislation was found for human assisted reproduction practices in Mexico; however, assisted reproduction clinics are ruled under some agreements implemented by national organizations such as the Mexican Association of Reproductive Medicine and, at the Latin America level, the Latin America Network of Assisted Reproduction (abbreviated REDLARA in Spanish); in addition, the practice of ART is considered, although not explicitly, in the General Health Law. Conclusion: In Mexico, there is no legal regulation in charge of assisted reproduction practices, which is why there is an urgent need to establish human assisted reproduction laws without incurring discriminatory and unconstitutional acts, and at the same time, be in accordance with scientific advances. This will allow a considerable reduction in the violation of human rights.";Europe | Human Assisted Reproduction | Latin America | Law | Legislation | Mexico | North America | Reforms | Regulations;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;598630;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if matured cumulus-oocyte complexes exposure to cryoprotectants (CPAs) or vitrification affects oocytes and cumulus cells viability, but also if DNA damage is generated in cumulus cells, affecting fertilization and embryo development. Results: The DNA damage in cumulus cells was measured using the alkaline comet assay and expressed as Comet Tail Length (CTL) and Olive Tail Moment (OTM). Results demonstrate that oocyte exposure to CPAs or vitrification reduced oocyte (75.5 ± 3.69%, Toxicity; 66.7 ± 4.57%, Vitrification) and cumulus cells viability (32.7 ± 5.85%, Toxicity; 7.7 ± 2.21%, Vitrification) compared to control (95.5 ± 4.04%, oocytes; 89 ± 4.24%, cumulus cells). Also, significantly higher DNA damage expressed as OTM was generated in the cumulus cells after exposure to CPAs and vitrification (39 ± 17.41, 33.6 ± 16.69, respectively) compared to control (7.4 ± 4.22). In addition, fertilization and embryo development rates also decreased after exposure to CPAs (35.3 ± 16.65%, 22.6 ± 3.05%, respectively) and vitrification (32.3 ± 9.29%, 20 ± 1%, respectively). It was also found that fertilization and embryo development rates in granulose-intact oocytes were significantly higher compared to denuded oocytes in the control groups. However, a decline in embryo development to the blastocyst stage was observed after CPAs exposure (1.66 ± 0.57%) or vitrification (2 ± 1%) compared to control (22.3 ± 2.51%). This could be attributed to the reduction in both cell types viability, and the generation of DNA damage in the cumulus cells. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that oocyte exposure to CPAs or vitrification reduced viability in oocytes and cumulus cells, and generated DNA damage in the cumulus cells, affecting fertilization and embryo development rates. These findings will allow to understand some of the mechanisms of oocyte damage after vitrification that compromise their developmental capacity, as well as the search for new vitrification strategies to increase fertilization and embryo development rates by preserving the integrity of the cumulus cells.";Cryoprotectants | Cumulus cells | DNA damage | Matured oocytes | Porcine | Vitrification;3;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;598630;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This allows them to know the disease and information about other conditions or comorbidities, treatments, and typical consequences of the Mexican population. This indicates that an expert in a domain knows technical information about the domain and contextual factors that interact with it in the real world, contributing to new knowledge generation. For capturing and managing information about the DM, it is necessary to design and implement techniques and methods that allow: determining the most relevant conceptual dimensions and their correct organization, the integration of existing medical and clinical information from different resources, and the generation of structures that represent the deduction process of the doctor. An Ontology Network is a collection of ontologies of diverse knowledge domains which can be interconnected by meta-relations. This article describes an Ontology Network for representing DM in Mexico, designed by a proposed methodology. The information used for Ontology Network building include the ontological resource reuse and non-ontological resource transformation for ontology design and ontology extending by natural language processing techniques. These are medical information extracted from vocabularies, taxonomies, medical dictionaries, ontologies, among others. Additionally, a set of semantic rules has been defined within the Ontology Network to derive new knowledge. Results: An Ontology Network for DM in Mexico has been built from six well-defined domains, resulting in new classes, using ontological and non-ontological resources to offer a semantic structure for assisting in the medical diagnosis process. The network comprises 1367 classes, 20 object properties, 63 data properties, and 4268 individuals from seven different ontologies. Ontology Network evaluation was carried out by verifying the purpose for its design and some quality criteria. Conclusions: The composition of the Ontology Network offers a set of well-defined ontological modules facilitating the reuse of one or more of them. The inclusion of international vocabularies as SNOMED CT or ICD-10 reinforces the representation by international standards. It increases the semantic interoperability of the network, providing the opportunity to integrate other ontologies with the same vocabularies. The ontology network design methodology offers a guide for ontology developers about how to use ontological and non-ontological resources in order to exploit the maximum of information and knowledge from a set of domains that share or not information.;Design methodology | Knowledge representation | Ontology network;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;785078;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It is therefore customary to enhance skin colour changes by submitting early citrus varieties to ethylene degreening treatment, which implies a cost and may result in external disorders. In this study, the effect on consumer expectations (sensory and hedonic) of providing them with information about the internal maturity of non-degreened mandarins (greenish-coloured rind) was evaluated. RESULTS: Mandarins with three different external colour indices (CI), CI = −6, CI = +1 and CI = +5, and three ways of conveying information, were investigated: (i) No information (NoInfo), (ii) The text ‘Mandarins ready to eat’ (Text) and (iii) Text + Visualisation of mandarin flesh (orange-coloured in all cases) (Text+Flesh). Consumer expected liking, purchase intention and sensory expectations were markedly affected after receiving the different information types. The greatest effect was detected when Text+Flesh information was provided. Rind mandarin colour was also a determinant factor of how consumer expectations were modified by the received information. Moreover, our results revealed some differences among Spanish and Mexican consumers, since maturity information had a stronger effect on hedonic expectations of Mexican consumers. CONCLUSIONS: When mandarins reach CI = +5 (pale orange-coloured rind with small areas still green), letting consumers know that mandarins are ready to eat by means of Text+Flesh information may be a non-cost strategy to avoid degreening treatment or to shorten its length. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.;CATA questions | expected liking | flesh visualisation | label | purchase intention | rind colour;3;0;;;GVA;PTA2017‐14164‐I;Generalitat Valenciana

While the burden of HIV is historically concentrated in urban areas and high-risk groups, subnational estimates that cover multiple countries and years are missing. This paucity is partially due to incomplete vital registration (VR) systems and statistical challenges related to estimating mortality rates in areas with low numbers of HIV deaths. In this analysis, we address this gap and provide novel estimates of the HIV mortality rate and the number of HIV deaths by age group, sex, and municipality in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Methods: We performed an ecological study using VR data ranging from 2000 to 2017, dependent on individual country data availability. We modeled HIV mortality using a Bayesian spatially explicit mixed-effects regression model that incorporates prior information on VR completeness. We calibrated our results to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. Results: All countries displayed over a 40-fold difference in HIV mortality between municipalities with the highest and lowest age-standardized HIV mortality rate in the last year of study for men, and over a 20-fold difference for women. Despite decreases in national HIV mortality in all countries—apart from Ecuador—across the period of study, we found broad variation in relative changes in HIV mortality at the municipality level and increasing relative inequality over time in all countries. In all six countries included in this analysis, 50% or more HIV deaths were concentrated in fewer than 10% of municipalities in the latest year of study. In addition, national age patterns reflected shifts in mortality to older age groups—the median age group among decedents ranged from 30 to 45 years of age at the municipality level in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico in 2017. Conclusions: Our subnational estimates of HIV mortality revealed significant spatial variation and diverging local trends in HIV mortality over time and by age. This analysis provides a framework for incorporating data and uncertainty from incomplete VR systems and can help guide more geographically precise public health intervention to support HIV-related care and reduce HIV-related deaths.;HIV mortality | HIV/AIDS | Latin America | Mapping | Small area estimation | Spatial statistics | Vital registration;55;1;repositoryam;Green;BMGF;undefined;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

The identification of clinical and molecular factors associated with the reversal, or regression, from IFG to a normoglycemia state would enable more efficient cardiovascular risk reduction strategies. The aim of this study was to identify clinical and biological predictors of regression to normoglycemia in a non-European population characterized by high rates of type 2 diabetes. Methods: We conducted a prospective, population-based study among 9637 Mexican individuals using clinical features and plasma metabolites. Among them, 491 subjects were classified as IFG, defined as fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL at baseline. Regression to normoglycemia was defined by fasting glucose less than 100 mg/dL in the follow-up visit. Plasma metabolites were profiled by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Multivariable cox regression models were used to examine the associations of clinical and metabolomic factors with regression to normoglycemia. We assessed the predictive capability of models that included clinical factors alone and models that included clinical factors and prioritized metabolites. Results: During a median follow-up period of 2.5 years, 22.6% of participants (n = 111) regressed to normoglycemia, and 29.5% progressed to type 2 diabetes (n = 145). The multivariate adjusted relative risk of regression to normoglycemia was 1.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25 to 1.32) per 10 years of age increase, 0.94 (95% CI 0.91–0.98) per 1 SD increase in BMI, and 0.91 (95% CI 0.88–0.95) per 1 SD increase in fasting glucose. A model including information from age, fasting glucose, and BMI showed a good prediction of regression to normoglycemia (AUC = 0.73 (95% CI 0.66–0.78). The improvement after adding information from prioritized metabolites (TG in large HDL, albumin, and citrate) was non-significant (AUC = 0.74 (95% CI 0.68–0.80), p value = 0.485). Conclusion: In individuals with IFG, information from three clinical variables easily obtained in the clinical setting showed a good prediction of regression to normoglycemia beyond metabolomic features.

The aim of this work is to search for specific features that can help physicians recognize this disease. Methods: This study included 84 FHTG cases, 728 subjects with common mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (CHTG) and 609 normotriglyceridemic controls. All subjects underwent genetic, clinical and biochemical assessments. A set of 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with triglycerides levels, as well as 37 rare variants within the five main genes associated with hypertriglyceridemia (i.e. LPL, APOC2, APOA5, LMF1 and GPIHBP1) were analyzed. A panel of endocrine regulatory proteins associated with triglycerides homeostasis were compared between the FHTG and CHTG groups. Results: Apolipoprotein B, fibroblast growth factor 21(FGF-21), angiopoietin-like proteins 3 (ANGPTL3) and apolipoprotein A-II concentrations, were independent components of a model to detect FHTG compared with CHTG (AUC 0.948, 95%CI 0.901–0.970, 98.5% sensitivity, 92.2% specificity, P < 0.001). The polygenic set of SNPs, accounted for 1.78% of the variance in triglyceride levels in FHTG and 6.73% in CHTG. Conclusions: The clinical and genetic differences observed between FHTG and CHTG supports the notion that FHTG is a unique entity, distinguishable from other causes of hypertriglyceridemia by the higher concentrations of insulin, FGF-21, ANGPTL3, apo A-II and lower levels of apo B. We propose the inclusion of these parameters as useful markers for differentiating FHTG from other causes of hypertriglyceridemia.;ANGPTL3 | Apolipoprotein B | Chylomicronemia | Familial hypertriglyceridemia | FGF-21 | Mexicans | Primary dyslipidemias;5;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;169342;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

While a number of genes and variants have been identified in recent decades as causative or protective agents of this condition, a limited number of studies have been conducted in mixed populations, such as Mexican Mestizos. The historical convergence of two founding groups and three ethnicities, and the increasing north-to-south gradient of Native American ancestry in Mexico resulted in a subpopulation structure with considerable genetic diversity. In this work, we investigate the influence of 21 known susceptibility variants for PD. Our case–control study, with a cohort of 311 Mexican Mestizo subjects, found a significant risk association for the variant rs1491942 in LRRK2. However, when stratification by ancestry was performed, a risk effect for MTHFR rs1801133 was observed only in the group with the highest percentage of European ancestry, and the PD risk effect for LRRK2 rs1491942 was significant in subjects with a higher ratio of Native American ancestry. Meta-analyses of these SNP revealed the effect of LRRK2 rs1491942 to be even more significant than previously described in populations of European descent. Although corroboration is necessary, our findings suggest that polymorphism rs1491942 may be useful as a risk marker of PD in Mexican Mestizos with greater Native American ancestry. The absence of associations with the remaining known risk factors is, in itself, a relevant finding and invites further research into the shared risk factors’ role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of this neurodegenerative disorder.;;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;FOSISS 2015:262327;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Its amplitude and growth slope are a measurement of the stimulation achieved by a tone pip on the auditory nerve. The stimulation and recording system constructed for this purpose, the features of this potential obtained in a group of 43 children, and its possible clinical use are described. The ECR is obtained by averaging the EEG epochs acquired each time the cochlear implant (CI) processes a tone pip of known frequency and intensity when the patient is sleeping and using the CI in everyday mode. The ECR is sensitive to tone pip intensity level, microphone sensitivity, sound processor gain, dynamic range of electrical current, and responsiveness to electrical current of the auditory nerve portion involved with the electrode under test. It allows individual evaluation of intracochlear electrodes by choosing, one at the time, the central frequency of the electrode as the test tone pip frequency, so the ECR measurement due to a variable intensity tone pip allows to establish the suitability of the dynamic range of the electrode current. Results: There is a difference in ECR measurements when patients are grouped based on their auditory behavior. The ECR slope and amplitude for the Sensitive group is 0.2 μV/dBHL and 10 μV at 50 dBHL compared with 0.04 μV/dBHL and 3 μV at 50dBHL for the Inconsistent group. The clinical cases show that adjusting the dynamic range of current based on the ECR improved the patient’s auditory behavior. Conclusions: ECR can be recorded regardless of the artifact due to the electromyographic activity of the patient and the functioning of the CI. Its amplitude and growth slope versus the intensity of the stimulus differs between electrodes. The relationship between minimum ECR detection intensity level and auditory threshold suggests the possibility of estimating patient auditory thresholds this way. ECR does not depend on the subject’s age, cooperation, or health status. It can be obtained at any time after implant surgery and the test procedure is the same regardless of device manufacturer.;Cochlear implant fitting | Current dynamic range | Objective test | Pediatric population;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Due to its alarming rate in comparison to North American standards, child mortality is particularly a health concern in Mexico. Despite this fact, there remains a dearth of studies that address its spatio-temporal identification in the country. The aims of this study are i) to model the evolution of child mortality risk at the municipality level in Greater Mexico City, (ii) to identify municipalities with high, medium, and low risk over time, and (iii) using municipality trends, to ascertain potential high-risk municipalities. Methods: In order to control for the space-time patterns of data, the study performs a Bayesian spatio-temporal analysis. This methodology permits the modelling of the geographical variation of child mortality risk across municipalities, within the studied time span. Results: The analysis shows that most of the high-risk municipalities were in the east, along with a few in the north and west areas of Greater Mexico City. In some of them, it is possible to distinguish an increasing trend in child mortality risk. The outcomes highlight municipalities currently presenting a medium risk but liable to become high risk, given their trend, after the studied period. Finally, the likelihood of child mortality risk illustrates an overall decreasing tendency throughout the 7-year studied period. Conclusions: The identification of high-risk municipalities and risk trends may provide a useful input for policymakers seeking to reduce the incidence of child mortality. The results provide evidence that supports the use of geographical targeting in policy interventions.;Bayesian mapping | Child mortality risk | Children’s health | Mexico | Space-time interactions;3;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

During ageing, histological alterations in the epididymis and decreased protein synthesis have been found. This might affect the sperm maturation process. The aim of this study was to determine if the changes in the epididymis during ageing might cause alterations in sperm maturation. Wistar rats of 3-4 months old (young) and 18-21 months old (old) were used. The testosterone concentration was determined and the epididymides were dissected and divided in three regions: caput, corpus, and cauda. The tissues were used for histological processing and sperm extraction. Testosterone concentration decreased 34% in the old animals compared to the young ones. The distribution of mannose, sialic acid, and N-acetylglucosamine in the glycocalyx of the sperm membrane of old animals was different from that of young animals. The same occurred with phosphatidylserine externalisation and protein phosphorylation at tyrosine residues. Epididymis histology in old animals showed tubular and cellular degeneration. Our results suggest that ageing affects maturational markers, likely due to alterations in the epididymis as a result of the testosterone decrease associated with ageing.;ageing | epididymis | externalization of phosphatidylserine | membrane carbohydrates | rats | sperm | sperm maturation | testosterone | tyrosine phosphorylation;0;0;;;CONACYT;CD.CBS.373.2017;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The first was carried out through the construction of an instrument that measures three dimensions of quality of life at work: Quality of life, organi-zational management, and organizational performance. Once the questionnaire was prepared, it was distributed to a group of teachers in a focus group so as to validate clarity and rel- evance. Criterion validity was established by comparing the proposed scale of quality of life at work with other instruments that measure quality of life at work. Construct validity was evaluated by exploratory factor analysis, using factor analysis with simple Varimax rotation, with the KMO and Bartlett test. The overall Cronbach's Α value was 0.983, which indicates that there is evidence that internal consistency can be characterized as good.

The article begins by describing the neurophysiological pathway of pain, followed by a discussion of the importance of the limbic system in responses to pain and anxiety, since prolonged exposure to situations that cause stress and pain generates such physiological changes as tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, hyperthermia, and heart rate variability (HRV), often accompanied by altered emotional states, deficient rest, and even aggressiveness. In the long term, animals may show deficiencies in their ability to deal with changes in the environment due to alterations in the functioning of their immune, nervous, and endocrinologic systems. In conclusion, pain and anxiety directly impact the homeostasis of organisms, so it is necessary to conduct objective evaluations of both sensations using behavioral scales, like the horse grimace scale, complemented by assessments of blood biomarkers to analyze their correlation with physiological parameters: Heart rate, respiratory rate, HRV, theparasympathetic tone activity index, lactate and glucose levels, and temperature. Additional tools – infrared thermography, for example – can also be used in these efforts to improve the quality of life and welfare of horses.;Anxiety | Equines | Nociception | Pain | Welfare;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Due to their close co-existence with humans, broad attention has been given to identifying these expressions in certain species, especially dogs. This review aims to analyze and discuss the advances in identifying the facial expressions of domestic dogs and their clinical utility in recognizing pain as a method to improve daily practice and, in an accessible and effective way, assess the health outcome of dogs. This study focuses on aspects related to the anatomy and physiology of facial expressions in dogs, their emotions, and evaluations of their eyebrows, eyes, lips, and ear positions as changes that reflect pain or nociception. In this regard, research has found that dogs have anatomical configurations that allow them to generate changes in their expressions that similar canids—wolves, for example—cannot produce. Additionally, dogs can perceive emotions similar to those of their human tutors due to close human-animal interaction. This phenomenon—called “emotional contagion”—is triggered precisely by the dog’s capacity to identify their owners’ gestures and then react by emitting responses with either similar or opposed expressions that correspond to positive or negative stimuli, respectively. In conclusion, facial expressions are essential to maintaining social interaction between dogs and other species, as in their bond with humans. Moreover, this provides valuable information on emotions and the perception of pain, so in dogs, they can serve as valuable elements for recognizing and evaluating pain in clinical settings.;Animal welfare | Emotions | Human-dog interaction | Pain | Positive and negative stimuli;10;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The study was carried out in La Serena city, region of Coquimbo, Chile and 22 semi-intensive dairy goat farms were assessed using the Animal Welfare Indicators protocol. In each evaluation, the following indicators and information were gathered: physical and behavioural indicators of animal welfare, farmers' sociodemographic information, farm facilities, husbandry practices and management of the farm, and farmers' perception of animal welfare. Of the goats evaluated (n = 446), the vast majority had a body condition score (BCS) considered normal (n = 349; 78.25%). The main welfare problems were poor hair condition, faecal soiling, overgrown claws and improper disbudding or dehorning. The majority of farmers (96%) considered it 'rather important' or 'very important' to handle their goats in a gentle manner, expressing concern about the welfare of their animals and considering pain as a negative experience for goats. A lower than expected percentage of very thin animals (low BCS) were seen, considering the drought conditions and the forage shortage that affects the region, and no animals were observed with signs of thermal stress. The semi-intensive production systems could be an alternative to pasture-based systems to overcome environmental challenges.";Animal welfare | Assessment | Dairy goats | Drought | Indicators | Perception;0;0;;;;undefined;

Objective: To compare the influence of nutritional status on oxidative stress (OS) markers in children aged 3-6 years. Methods: Children were categorized into four groups: underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. Glucose (Glu), cholesterol (Chol), high-density lipoproteins, insulin, triacylglycerols (TG), triacylglycerols/glucose (TyG) index, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were analyzed. In addition, OS [malondialdehyde (MDA) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT)] and antioxidant defense markers [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and the ratio of reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG)] were quantified. Results: Children with obesity showed significantly higher levels of MDA and 3-NT, and increased SOD activity compared with normal weight children. Glu, Chol, TG levels, TyG indexes, HOMA-IR, MDA, 3-NT, and SOD positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention percentiles (CDC PC). However, CAT concentration and the GSH/GSSG ratio correlated negatively with BMI and CDC PC. In children with underweight, we found a positive correlation of TG levels and TyG indexes with BMI, whereas both markers positively correlated with BMI and CDC PC in children with overweight. MDA negatively correlated with BMI in children with underweight, while a positive association was observed in children with overweight. Finally, SOD, CAT, and GSH/GSSG negatively correlated with both BMI and CDC PC in children with overweight. Conclusions: Malnutrition, especially obesity, is associated with metabolic and OS disturbances in preschool children. It is urgent to design strategies to prevent malnutrition in this age group since this stage of development is crucial to potentially avoid future co-morbidities.;children | insulin resistance | malnutrition | obesity | overweight | oxidative stress | underweight;5;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Anthropomorphism is defined as the tendency to attribute human forms, behaviors, and emotions to non-human animals or objects. Anthropomorphism is particularly relevant for companion animals. Some anthropomorphic practices can be beneficial to them, whilst others can be very detrimental. Some anthropomorphic behaviors compromise the welfare and physiology of animals by interfering with thermoregulation, while others can produce dehydration due to the loss of body water, a condition that brings undesirable consequences such as high compensatory blood pressure and heat shock, even death, depending on the intensity and frequency of an animal’s exposure to these stressors. Malnutrition is a factor observed due to consumption of junk food or an imbalance in caloric proportions. This can cause obesity in pets that may have repercussions on their locomotor apparatus. Intense human–animal interaction can also lead to the establishment of attachment that impacts the mental state and behavior of animals, making them prone to develop aggression, fear, or anxiety separation syndrome. Another aspect is applying cosmetics to pets, though scientific studies have not yet determined whether cosmetic products such as coat dyes, nail polish, and lotions are beneficial or harmful for the animals, or to what extent. The cohabitation of animals in people’s homes can also constitute a public health risk due to infectious and zoonotic diseases. In this context, this paper aims to analyze the adverse effects of anthropomorphism on the welfare of companion animals from several angles—physiological, sanitary, and behavioral—based on a discussion of current scientific findings.;Attachment | Behavior | Emotions | Health | Human–animal interaction | Malnutrition | Pet clothes | Zoonoses;9;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Using Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and PubMed databases, a systematic search was performed for studies published in scientific journals that investigated the effects of TANs supplementation on the variables of interest. Only studies with weaned or older sheep were included. The data analyzed were extracted from 53 peer-reviewed publications. The sheep included in the present study were between 2 and 6 months old, and between 12 and 31 kg of body weight. The effects of TANs were analyzed using random-effects statistical models to examine the standardized mean difference (SMD) between treatments with TANs and control (no TANs). Heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression and a subgroup analysis was performed for covariates that were significant. Supplementation with TANs did not affect dry matter intake, pH, color (L* and b*), Warner–Bratzler shear force, cooking loss and meat chemical composition (p > 0.05). Supplementation with TANs increased daily weight gain (SMD = 0.274, p < 0.05), total antioxidant capacity (SMD = 1.120, p < 0.001), glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity (SMD = 0.801, p < 0.001) and catalase (SMD = 0.848, p < 0.001), and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in blood serum (SMD = −0.535, p < 0.05). Supplementation with TANs decreased feed conversion rate (SMD = −0.246, p < 0.05), and the concentration of MDA (SMD = −2.020, p < 0.001) and metmyoglobin (SMD = −0.482, p < 0.05) in meat.

Even though lactation demands high energy expenditures, behaviors known as allonursing (the nursing of non-descendant infants) and allosuckling (suckling from any female other than the mother) have been reported in various species of wild or domestic, and terrestrial or aquatic animals. These behaviors seem to be elements of a multifactorial strategy, since reports suggest that they depend on the following: species, living conditions, social stability, and kinship relations, among other group factors. Despite their potential benefits, allonursing and allosuckling can place the health and welfare of both non-filial dams and alien offspring at risk, as it augments the probability of pathogen transmission. This review aims to analyze the biological and physiological foundations and bioenergetic costs of these behaviors, analyzing the individual and collective advantages and disadvantages for the dams’ own offspring(s) and alien neonate(s). We also include information on the animal species in which these behaviors occur and their implications on animal welfare.;Animal perinatology | Fostering | Lactation | Mismothering | Non-offspring nursing;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a public health problem in Mexico, and uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is one of the main etiological agents. Flagella, type I fimbriae, and curli promote the ability of these bacteria to successfully colonize its host. Aim. This study aimed to determine whether flagella-, type I fimbriae-, and curli-expressing UPEC induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines in an established coculture system. Methods. The fliC, fimH, and csgA genes by UPEC strain were disrupted by allelic replacement. Flagella, type I fimbriae, and curli were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). HTB-5 (upper chamber) and HMC-1 (lower chamber) cells cocultured in Transwell® plates were infected with these UPEC strains and purified proteins. There was adherence to HTB-5 cells treated with different UPEC strains and they were quantified as colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Results. High concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were induced by the FimH and FliC proteins; however, these cytokines were detected in low concentrations in presence of CsgA. Compared with UPEC CFT073, CFT073∆fimH, CFT073∆fimH∆fliC, and CFT073∆csgA∆fimH strains significantly reduced the adherence to HTB-5 cells. Conclusion. The FimH and FliC proteins are involved in IL-6 and IL-8 release in a coculture model of HTB-5 and HMC-1 cells.";Adherence | Coculture | Cytokines | Fimbriae | UPEC;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;HIMFG;undefined;Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez

The presumptive B. cereus (s.l.) isolates were tested using a tRNACys-PCR-based approach and the results identified species related phylogenetically to B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. toyonensis. Their toxigenic potential was assessed by serological tests to detect enterotoxins (Nhe and Hbl) and by PCR targeting the hemolysin BL (hbl) component C (hblC) and non-hemolytic enterotoxin component A (nheA). The antibiotic profiles of the isolates showed a high resistance to β-lactams (100% of the isolates), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (100%), tetracycline (90%), erythromycin (77%), clindamycin (74%), and chloramphenicol (42%). Our results indicate the presence of B. cereus s.l. with toxigenic characteristics in Mexican chili powder. Because of the potential for these organisms to cause disease through their production of various toxins, and resistance to antibiotics, we recommend that a microbiological risk assessment must be considered in the Mexican regulatory requirements.;Antibiotics resistance | Bacillus cereus sensu lato | Mexican chili powder | TRNA -PCR Cys;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;UAQ;FONDEC-UAQ-2019-FCQ202001;Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro

Data were recorded for 143 journeys encompassing 1,040 commercial cattle, originating from feedlots, free-range, and dairy production systems. Details on journey distance, vehicle type, cattle type, and animals' origin were gathered from abattoir reports.We found that carcase bruising (41%) and hoof disorders (43.9%) had the highest prevalence, regardless of the production system.Variables such as cattle type and production system influenced liver condemnations; old bulls extensively raised were more prone to present parasitosis such as Fasciola hepatica.Transportation conditions (journey distance, vehicle type) and cattle type might have influenced the development of hoof disorders in the evaluated animals. Multivariable logistic regression showed that animals'origin was a potential risk factor for severe bruising and high muscle pH, with cull dairy cows getting the most serious damage. In general, cattle transport conditions were factors that showed interactions with three of the evaluated indicators (severe hoof injuries, carcase bruising, meat pH24h).

This study evaluates the effect of HIU (40 kHz, 9.6 W/cm2, 20 and 40 min) and post-mortem development on the yield and physicochemical quality of rabbit meat in samples treated with HIU pre- and post-storage in a freezer (120 h at −20 °C). Twenty rabbit carcasses were vacuum packed 12 h post-mortem, placed in a fridge at 4 °C for 24 h, and divided in two groups (HIU application before or after freezing), before assigning the treatments. The results show that HIU before freezing produced intense and bright orange-yellow colours, whereas its application after freezing resulted in pale red tones. HIU application accelerates rigor mortis resolution when it is applied before freezing and causes a significant decrease in pH immediately following the HIU treatment. Post-freezing application of HIU is not recommended because it considerably increased weight loss and toughening of the meat when long exposure times were used (40 min). In contrast, a short treatment duration with HIU mitigated the effects of freezing and produced significant increases in water-holding capacity (WHC) after cold storage. The yield (weight loss) of the rabbit meat was not affected when HIU was applied pre-freezing. The application of HIU pre-freezing constitutes a promising technology because it increased the tenderness and the WHC of rabbit meat. However, more research is needed to improve the appearance before scaling up to industrial levels.;Freezing | High intensity ultrasound | Meat quality | Rabbit meat | Yield;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Design: A cross-sectional experimental study was conducted at Acupuncture Facility at Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, Ciudad de México, México. Participants: Fifteen healthy university students (seven women) aged 22.5 ± 1.36 (mean ± SD) participated in the present study to investigate the changes in cardiovascular function after standing active standing and their modification with manual acupuncture in Pericardium 6 (Neiguan) acupoint in healthy volunteers. Interventions: The treatment consisted of one session of manual acupuncture in the Pericardium 6 (Neiguan) in the right arm. The following data for continuous beat-to-beat registration: mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), total peripheral resistance (TPR), and left ventricular ejection time were computed in healthy volunteers after standing. The obtained signals were plotted and averaged, and a linear correlation of each average was calculated. Besides, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for the recording periods of 1–10 after the standing position in basal and treated conditions. Results: Acupuncture was showed to increase the speed of change in MAP, HR, and TPR and decreased the speed of changes in SV and LVET when comparing the slopes of the initial cardiovascular changes related to active standing. Besides, Pearson analysis showed that acupuncture treatment modifies to higher correlation the cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress. Conclusions: We found that manual acupuncture in the right PC6 boosted the initial adaptive mechanisms to orthostatic stress in healthy subjects. It is valuable to initiate clinical trials to see if this treatment improves symptoms in patients with orthostatic hypotension.;Heart rate | Left ventricular ejection time | Mean arterial pressure | Orthostatic stress | Pericardium 6 acupoint;0;0;;;;undefined;

Labour is a crucial moment for numerous species and is usually the most painful experience in females. Contrary to the extensive research in humans, there are limited pain studies associated with the birth process in domestic animals. Nonetheless, awareness of parturition has increased among the public, owners, and the scientific community during recent years. Dystocia is a significant factor that increases the level of parturition pain. It is considered less common in polytocous species because newborns’ number and small size might lead to the belief that the parturition process is less painful than in monotocous animal species and humans. This review aims to provide elements of the current knowledge about human labour pain (monotocous species), the relevant contribution of the rat model to human labour pain, and the current clinical and experimental knowledge of parturition pain mechanisms in domestic animals that support the fact that domestic polytocous species also experience pain. Moreover, both for women and domestic animal species, parturition’s pain represents a potential welfare concern, and information on pain indicators and the appropriate analgesic therapy are discussed.;Delivery | Distress | Farrowing | Labour | Pain | parturition | Whelping;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The objective of this study was to evaluate the capability of micro-Raman spectroscopy to classify teeth of different fluorosis severities, applying principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA), and estimate the model cross-validation accuracy. Forty teeth of different fluo-rosis severities and a control group were analyzed. Ten spectra were captured from each tooth and a total of 400 micro-Raman spectra were acquired in the wavenumber range of 250 to 1200 cm–1, including the bands corresponding to stretching and bending internal vibrational modes ν1, ν2, ν3, and ν4 (PO43–). From the analysis of the micro-Raman spectra an increase in B-type carbonate ion substitution into the phosphate site of the hydroxyapatite as fluorosis severity increases was iden-tified. The PCA-LDA model showed a sensitivity and specificity higher than 94% and 93% for the different fluorosis severity groups, respectively. The cross-validation accuracy was higher than 90%. Micro-Raman spectroscopy combined with PCA-LDA provides an adequate tool for the diagnosis of fluorosis severity.

In recent years, buffalo production has been incorporated into the region, with possibilities for development in profitable and sustainable models. To study this option in depth, a broad bibliographic review was carried out focusing on the ecological characteristics of tropical zones and the physiological and productive characteristics of buffaloes. We also investigated the structure and functioning of dual‐purpose systems that have worked in cattle and that can be optimized with this alternative animal species. The possibility of taking sustainable advantage of abundant forage resources in the region was detected through intensive grazing models, as well as agrosilvopastoral systems, due to the gregarious qualities of buffaloes and responding to their thermoregulation needs. In this way, the productive and regenerative capacities of the dual‐purpose system could be increased, as well as the quality of meat and milk, which could be marketed as differentiated products, taking advantage of their outstanding nutritional qualities. Integral management of the dual‐purpose system is proposed, retaking the bases of the original model of family characters, diversified and with low investments and risks, which with specific innovations can be an effective development option for producers in the region.;;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the effect of dapsone on tactile allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia and to determine its anti-oxidant effect in a spinal cord injury (SC) model in rats. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Neuropathic pain (NP) as result of traumatic spinal cord injury is a deleterious medical condition with temporal or permanent time-course. Painful stimuli trigger a cascade of events that activate the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, inducing an increase in oxidative stress. Since there is no effective treatment for this condition, dapsone (4,4'diaminodiphenylsulfone) is proposed as potential treatment for NP. Its anti-oxidant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties have been documented, however, there is no evidence regarding its use for treatment of NP induced by SCI. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effect of dapsone as preventive or acute treatment after NP was already established. Furthermore, participation of oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring lipid peroxidation (LP) and glutathione concentration (GSH) in rats with SCI. RESULTS: Acute treatment with dapsone (3.1-25 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased nociceptive behaviors in a dose-dependent manner, decreased LP, and increased GSH in the injured tissue 15 days after the injury was produced. On the other hand, preventive treatment (3 h post-injury, once daily for 3 days) with dapsone (3.1-25 mg/kg, i.p.) yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the anti-nociceptive effect of dapsone is regulated through the decrease of oxidative stress and the excitotoxicity is associated with the activation of NMDA receptors.Level of Evidence: N/A.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

The objective of this review article is to present the current knowledge on the factors that cause stress in fighting bulls during bullfights, including their dying process, by discussing the neurobiology and their physiological responses. The literature shows that biochemical imbalances occur during bullfights, including hypercalcaemia, hypermagnesaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperlactataemia, and hyperglycaemia, associated with increased endogenous cortisol and catecholamine levels. Creatine kinase, citrate synthase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels also increase, coupled with decreases in pH, blood bi-carbonate levels, excess base, partial oxygen pressure, and oxygen saturation. The intense exercise also causes a marked decrease of glycogen in type I and II muscle fibres that can produce myoglobinuria and muscular necrosis. Other observations suggest the presence of osteochondrosis. The existing information allows us to conclude that during bullfights, bulls face energy and metabolic demands due to the high intensity and duration of the exercise performed, together with muscular injuries, physiological changes, and high enzyme concentrations. In addition, the final stage of the bullfight causes a slow dying process for an animal that is sentient and conscious of its surroundings.;Abattoir | Animal welfare | Cattle | Fighting bulls | Pain | Sensitisation | Stunning;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The text examines some of the key sequences from these films, and analyzes the way in which these diseases appear in Mexican cinema as allegories that reflect on the social order and that express the collective fears and concerns of a certain historical moment.;Epidemics | Infecto-contagious diseases | Mexican cinema | Mexico;0;0;;;;undefined;

September 2021;The Lancet;01406736;16590;1474547X;Journal;398;10303;;870-905;"Background: Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 has targeted elimination of preventable child mortality, reduction of neonatal death to less than 12 per 1000 livebirths, and reduction of death of children younger than 5 years to less than 25 per 1000 livebirths, for each country by 2030. To understand current rates, recent trends, and potential trajectories of child mortality for the next decade, we present the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 findings for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality in children younger than 5 years of age, with multiple scenarios for child mortality in 2030 that include the consideration of potential effects of COVID-19, and a novel framework for quantifying optimal child survival. Methods: We completed all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality analyses from 204 countries and territories for detailed age groups separately, with aggregated mortality probabilities per 1000 livebirths computed for neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and under-5 mortality rate (U5MR). Scenarios for 2030 represent different potential trajectories, notably including potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impact of improvements preferentially targeting neonatal survival. Optimal child survival metrics were developed by age, sex, and cause of death across all GBD location-years. The first metric is a global optimum and is based on the lowest observed mortality, and the second is a survival potential frontier that is based on stochastic frontier analysis of observed mortality and Healthcare Access and Quality Index. Findings: Global U5MR decreased from 71·2 deaths per 1000 livebirths (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 68·3–74·0) in 2000 to 37·1 (33·2–41·7) in 2019 while global NMR correspondingly declined more slowly from 28·0 deaths per 1000 live births (26·8–29·5) in 2000 to 17·9 (16·3–19·8) in 2019. In 2019, 136 (67%) of 204 countries had a U5MR at or below the SDG 3.2 threshold and 133 (65%) had an NMR at or below the SDG 3.2 threshold, and the reference scenario suggests that by 2030, 154 (75%) of all countries could meet the U5MR targets, and 139 (68%) could meet the NMR targets. Deaths of children younger than 5 years totalled 9·65 million (95% UI 9·05–10·30) in 2000 and 5·05 million (4·27–6·02) in 2019, with the neonatal fraction of these deaths increasing from 39% (3·76 million [95% UI 3·53–4·02]) in 2000 to 48% (2·42 million; 2·06–2·86) in 2019. NMR and U5MR were generally higher in males than in females, although there was no statistically significant difference at the global level. Neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years in 2019, followed by lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, congenital birth defects, and malaria. The global optimum analysis suggests NMR could be reduced to as low as 0·80 (95% UI 0·71–0·86) deaths per 1000 livebirths and U5MR to 1·44 (95% UI 1·27–1·58) deaths per 1000 livebirths, and in 2019, there were as many as 1·87 million (95% UI 1·35–2·58; 37% [95% UI 32–43]) of 5·05 million more deaths of children younger than 5 years than the survival potential frontier. Interpretation: Global child mortality declined by almost half between 2000 and 2019, but progress remains slower in neonates and 65 (32%) of 204 countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, are not on track to meet either SDG 3.2 target by 2030. Focused improvements in perinatal and newborn care, continued and expanded delivery of essential interventions such as vaccination and infection prevention, an enhanced focus on equity, continued focus on poverty reduction and education, and investment in strengthening health systems across the development spectrum have the potential to substantially improve U5MR. Given the widespread effects of COVID-19, considerable effort will be required to maintain and accelerate progress.

It is generating incorrect eating habits until adulthood. The problem comes to be generated by factors of education, geographical areas and family economy. Methodology: This work consists of a study carried out in a rural community in the State of Oaxaca in children between the ages of 3 and 12, to whom questionnaires were applied to know their eating habits, in addition, anthropometric measurements such as height, weight and BMI. Results: It was determined through this work that most children in this community hardly consume junk food. Their heights and weights were compared with data from children of the same age obtained by the World Health Organization (WHO). It was observed within the ranges of the exact parameters obtained in the children studied. Conclusion: Children must be fed healthily so as not to generate subsequent health problems, such as chronic diseases, among which are mainly diabetes, hypertension, obesity and other health problems that, in addition to the impact on the quality of life of people, over the years becomes a very significant economic burden to the health sector and the economy of the families themselves.;Chronic Disease | Economy | Food | Public Health;1;0;;;;undefined;

To meet this aim, a validation study was conducted with a sample of Mexican adults (n=115, 37% men) that were randomly divided into two groups to develop and validate new equations to estimate TEE. TEE was measured by indirect calorimetry and heart rate monitoring for at least three days. These measurements were considered as the reference method. The predictors of TEE were age, sex, fat and fat-free mass, body weight and physical activity level (PAL), which was assessed with two questions. The accuracy of factorial methods (e.g. FAO/WHO or Ainsworth's metabolic equivalents list) and empirical equations to estimate TEE was compared. Multiple linear regression and Intra-class correlation coefficients were estimate as agreement measurement. The equation developed is as follows: TEE (kcal / d) = 1331.712 - (686.344 x sex, men: 1, women: 2) + (18,051 x body weight, kg) - (16.020 x age, years) + (894.007 x PAL). The accuracy of the equation was modest in the development (R2 = 54.4, standard error = 511.3) and validation (R2 = 59.2, standard error = 372.8) samples. However, this equation had higher accuracy than factorial methods or empirical equations. The equation was developed to estimate the TEE of Mexican adults, which can be used as a general guide to provide nutritional counselling.;Adults | Heart rate | Indirect calorimetry | Physical activity | Resting energy expenditure | Total energy expenditure;0;0;;;;undefined;

This article seeks to provide a synthetic and practical explanation about the function of the main intracellular signaling pathways, exemplifying the importance of each of these through the pathophysiological explanation of various diseases in which there is a prominent role. Among the signaling pathways treated in this work are those activated by protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), phosphatodylinositol- 3-kinase (PI3K), Ca2+/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), the tyrosine kinase (TK) family, the Ras superfamily, as well as the MAPK pathway. In addition, other components of importance for signaling pathways are addressed, such as the ubiquitin-proteosome system, integrins, as well as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and other cell cycle regulators. Some of the diseases treated within the text are diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, various cardiac arrhythmias, cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, nephrotic syndrome, etc., which are diseases of great relevance in current medicine.;Cell proliferation | Cell signaling pathways | MAPK | PI3K | Signal transduction pathways;0;0;;;;undefined;

Tramadol is a widely prescribed analgesic drug for dogs and cats; it has a synthetic partial agonism on μ-opioid receptors and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. However, the biotransformation and resultant metabolites differ between species and depend on cytochrome interactions. Dogs mainly produce the inactive N-desmethyl tramadol metabolite, whereas cats exhibit an improved antinociceptive effect owing to rapid active O-desmethyltramadol metabolite production and a longer elimination half-life. Tapentadol, a novel opioid with dual action on μ-receptors and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitory activity, is a promising option in dogs, as it is less reliant on metabolic activation and is unaffected by cytochrome polymorphisms. Although scientific evidence on the analgesic activity of tapentadol in both species remains limited, experimental studies indicate potential benefits in animals. This review summarizes and compares the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy of tramadol and tapentadol in dogs and cats with different pain conditions. According to the available data, tramadol seems a more suitable therapeutic option for cats and should preferably be used as a component of multimodal analgesia in both species, particularly dogs. Tapentadol might possess a superior analgesic profile in small animals, but additional studies are required to comprehensively evaluate the activity of to manage pain in dogs and cats.";Analgesia | cats | dogs | pain | tapentadol | tramadol;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Qualitative study through 85 semi-structured interviews with those responsible for the implementation, dissemination and application activities, and of the operational personnel in primary care centers and hospitals in seven states of Mexico.The content was coded and analyzed with ATLAS.ti 7.0. Results. The main barriers found were the failure to update the CPGs and low alignment with other standards, and the impossibility of implementing them due to work overload and limited resources. Conclusions. The effort to implement CPG seems to have been erratic and insufficient, and the evaluation of its use non-existent. It is proposed to create integrated and contextualized strategies that prove to be more effective and efficient for the successful implementation of the CPG.;calidad de la atención de salud | Guía de Práctica Clínica | implementación | implementation | Mexico | México | practice guideline | quality of health care;2;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It also discusses adoption and responsible ownership, identifies what failed in promoting positive human-dog interaction, and suggests strategies to address this problem. It concludes that adoption alone is not an effective solution but that it is necessary to offer education and awareness programs for owners, organize sterilization campaigns, and develop and apply - with the corresponding authorities - measures to ensure animal welfare that will provide benefits for society and improve animal quality of life. The role of veterinarians is fundamental in education and in disseminating the necessary information to orient people before they acquire a pet and prevent animal abandonment to resolve this problem.;Canine overpopulation | Dog population management | Free-roaming dogs | Public health | Stray dogs | Zoonosis;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Relevant peer-reviewed literature published between 1980 and 2021 was retrieved from CAB Abstracts, PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases. Although animals were used to produce draught power since their domestication and are still being used for this purpose, mechanisation has markedly reduced animal labour demand in agriculture. However, the process was uneven across continents according to economic constraints, and draught animals are currently concentrated in small production units located on terrains that do not favour agriculture mechanisation in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Generally, equids can work at rates similar to those of bovids or faster but can sustain the work for shorter periods of time. In addition, buffaloes possess tough hooves and resistance to disease that make them suitable for working in wetlands and clay soils. Draught animals allow a marked reduction of both GHG emissions and non-renewable energy consumption as compared with agricultural machinery. In addition, they may allow obtaining profits from otherwise non-usable lands. Therefore, their use should be promoted in rural areas where low investments are usually the only ones feasible, and the energy of the animals can be obtained at a low cost by feeding them harvest residues and by-products. However, more attention should be paid to the quality of human–animal interactions—due to the close contact between animals and humans while working—and to the welfare of draught animals when transported and slaughtered—due to the high prevalence of injuries they suffer when subjected to these practices.;Animal welfare | Bovids | Buffaloes | Cattle | Donkeys | Draught animals | Equids | Greenhouse gas emission | Horses | Rural activities;12;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In Mexico, there are no national, state, nor municipal estimates that inform the country’s situation over time. The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence of LBW at the national, state, and municipal levels from 2008 to 2017, and to estimate the LBW incidence based on maternal sociodemographic characteristics, prenatal care and marginalization indexes at the national level using open national data. We used spatial data analysis to georeferenced LBW incidence at the three levels of geographical disaggregation studied. At the national level, the incidence of LBW increased progressively from 6.2% (2008) to 7.1% (2017), and the country’s capital represented the area with the highest incidence. Southeastern and central states reported the highest LBW regional incidence. At the municipal level, the number of municipalities with an incidence of LBW ≥8% increased in both male and female newborns. The incidence of LBW was higher as the marginalization indexes increases. The results from this study may assist in the identification of vulnerable groups and the development of public health programs and policies with an intersectoral approach that improves maternal and child nutrition.;;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

A semi-structured interview was applied to 114 production units, chosen by stratified random sampling. The interview included technological, production and socioeconomic aspects. Twenty-eight variables were initially explored and 12 were used for multivariate analysis, which included Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and K-means Cluster. The characterisation carried out showed that the production units that predominate in northeastern Michoacán have survived with a low technological level, having as strengths the diversification of their activities and the use of family labour. On the contrary, production units with a high technological level and high productivity are few and less diversified. This shows the need to generate differentiated public policies for each cluster, aimed at strengthening the aspects that have allowed them to survive and guaranteeing a market for their production, before promoting the use of technologies.;Family labour | Holstein model | Multivariate analysis | Small-scale dairy systems;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of chronic stress on the viability, integrity, and maturation of rat oocytes depending on estrous cycle phases, specifically proestrus, estrus, and diestrus. Methods: For this purpose, adult female rats were stressed daily by cold water immersion (15◦C) for 30 consecutive days. Results: In chronically stressed female rats, irregular estrous cyclicity, increased corticosterone levels, decreased oocyte viability, and an increased percentage of abnormal oocytes were obtained in all the estrous cycle phases, resulting in reduced oocyte maturation during proestrus.

Hyperexcitability of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and oxidative stress have been reported to be associated with pain development. Amantadine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has been proposed as a potential therapy for NP. However, its use has not been tested for NP after SCI. Methods: To produce SCI, 120 female Wistar rats were used, a contusion injury to the T10 and T12 thoracic vertebrae was performed from heights of 6.25 mm and 12.5 mm. Nociceptive behaviour, was evaluated with the use of von Frey filaments for 31 days. The final products of lipid peroxidation (LP) and concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the injured tissue were quantified by fluorescence spectrophotometry. The antinociceptive effect of the acute (15 days after the injury) and chronic (once daily for three days immediately after the injury) with amantadine (6.25–50 mg/Kg. I.p.) was determined. Finally, the LP and GSH were quantified in the injured tissue. Results: Acute treatment with amantadine reduced nociceptive behaviour. Concomitantly, LP was decreased by Amantadine treatment while GSH increased in the injured tissue. Similar effects were observed with chronic treatment with amantadine. Conclusions: Data from this study suggested that the antinociceptive effects of amantadine treatment are modulated through oxidative stress and excitotoxicity reduction associated with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors activation. Significance: This study suggests that acute treatment with amantadine decreases hypersensitivity threshold and frequency of hypersensitivity response in a dose-dependent manner, in rats with SCI, by decreasing oxidative stress. Since amantadine is an easily accessible drug and has fewer adverse effects than current treatments for hypersensitivity threshold and frequency of hypersensitivity response, amantadine could represent a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of neuropathic pain. However, further research is required to provide evidence of the effectiveness and feasibility.;;2;0;;;CONACYT;578487/ CVU;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It has been reported that some ameloblastomas could arise from dentigerous cyst walls; thus, the development of ameloblastoma from dentigerous cysts may be due to differential protein expression. Our aim was to identify a membrane protein that is differentially expressed in ameloblastomas with respect to dentigerous cysts. Methods: We analyzed the SDS-PAGE profiles of membrane proteins from ameloblastomas and dentigerous cysts. The protein in a band present in the ameloblastoma sample, but apparently absent in the dentigerous cyst sample was identified via mass spectrometry as the chaperonin Hsp60. We used western blotting and immunohistochemistry to analyze its overexpression and localization in ameloblastoma. Results: We found a differential band of 95 kDa in the membrane proteins of ameloblastoma. In this band, the chaperonin Hsp60 was identified, and its overexpression was corroborated using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Hsp60 was localized in the plasma membrane of all ameloblastoma samples studied; in addition, it was found in the cell nucleus of the plexiform subtype of conventional ameloblastoma. Conclusions: Our results suggest that Hsp60 may be involved in ameloblastoma development, and could therefore be a potential therapeutic target for ameloblastoma treatment.";Dentigerous cyst | Differential expression | Hsp60 | Membrane proteins | Odontogenic tumors;0;0;;;CONACYT;230110;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In low- and middle-income countries, adolescents' offspring growth little has been studied. Objective: To determine the association of maternal sociodemographic characteristics with weight, length, and BMI change in adolescents' offspring in their first year of life. Methods: This is a one-year follow-up study that included adolescent mothers and their offspring from 2010 to 2017. The infant anthropometric variables were performed at birth, 3, 6, and 12 months. Maternal health, pregnancy, and social variables were evaluated as well as birth outcomes. Crude, percentage, Z score, and percentile changes of weight, length, and BMI were evaluated from birth to 1-year-old. Statistical analyses were adjusted by maternal chronological age, socioeconomic status, breastfeeding duration, the timing of introduction of complementary feeding, among other variables. Results: We examined 186 dyads (mother-infant). The median maternal age was 15.5 years, and the mean pre-pregnancy BMI was 20. The mean gestational age was 39.1 weeks for infants, birth weight was 3,039 g, and length at birth was 49.5-cm. Maternal chronological age, the timing of introduction of complementary feeding, socioeconomic status, and maternal occupation were associated with offspring's weight gain at 12 months. Length gain was associated with exclusive breastfeeding. Socioeconomic status and occupation were associated with offspring's BMI change. When performing adjusted multivariable analyses, weight and length at birth were associated weight and BMI at 12 months. Conclusions: Weight at birth may negatively predict infant's weight and BMI changes at 12 months, while length at birth may positively predict the changes. Maternal chronological age, socioeconomic level, occupation, and the timing of the introduction of complementary feeding were associated with the weight change. Only exclusive breastfeeding was associated with length Z-score change in adolescents' offspring in their first 12-months of life.;body weight | breastfeeding | child growth | infant | Mexico | pregnancy during adolescence;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;INPer;212250-49451;Instituto Nacional de Perinatología

A total of 52 female dogs were evaluated and distributed in four categories: C1 (4.0–8.0 kg, n = 19), C2 (8.1–16.0 kg, n = 16), C3 (16.1–32.0 kg, n = 11), and C4 (32.1–35.8 kg, n = 6). The dams produced 225 liveborn puppies and 47 were classified as stillbirth type II. Blood samples were taken from the umbilical vein to evaluate the concentration of gases, glucose, lactate, calcium, hematocrit levels, and blood pH. The liveborn puppies in C2, C3, and C4 had more evident physiological alterations (hypercapnia, acidosis) than those in C1 (p < 0.05). These signs indicate a process of transitory asphyxiation. The stillborn pups in all four categories had higher weights than their liveborn littermates. C3 and C4 had the highest mean weights (419.86 and 433.79 g, respectively) and mortality rates (C3 = 20.58%, C4 = 24.58%). Results suggest that if the weight of the bitch is >16.1 kg in eutocic births, there is a higher risk of intrapartum physiological alterations and death.

The operating principle of IRT is detecting the heat irradiated in anatomical regions characterized by a high density of near-surface blood vessels that can regulate temperature gain or loss from/to the environment by modifying blood flow. This is essential for understanding the various vascular thermoregulation mechanisms of different species, such as rodents and ruminants’ tails. The usefulness of ocular, nasal, and vulvar thermal windows in the orbital (regio orbitalis), nasal (regio nasalis), and urogenital (regio urogenitalis) regions, respectively, has been demonstrated in cattle. However, recent evidence for the river buffalo has detected discrepancies in the data gathered from distinct thermal regions in these large ruminants, suggesting a limited sensitivity and specificity when used with this species due to various factors: the presence of hair, ambient temperature, and anatomical features, such as skin thickness and variations in blood supplies to different regions.

We discuss recent findings on four thermal windows—the orbital and nasal regions, mammary gland in the udder region (regio uberis), and vulvar in the urogenital region (regio urogenitalis)—to elucidate the factors that modulate and intervene in validating thermal windows and interpreting the information they provide, as it relates to the clinical usefulness of IRT for cattle (Bos) and the river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).;Animal welfare | Bubalus bubalis | Cows | Infrared thermography | River buffalo | Thermal window;30;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In contrast, fever is a controlled state, since the body adjusts its stable temperature range to increase body temperature without losing the thermoregu-lation capacity. Fever refers to an acute phase response that confers a survival benefit on the body, raising core body temperature during infection or systemic inflammation processes to reduce the survival and proliferation of infectious pathogens by altering temperature, restriction of essential nutrients, and the activation of an immune reaction. However, once the infection resolves, the febrile response must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive tissue damage. During fever, neurolog-ical, endocrine, immunological, and metabolic changes occur that cause an increase in the stable temperature range, which allows the core body temperature to be considerably increased to stop the invasion of the offending agent and restrict the damage to the organism. There are different metabolic mechanisms of thermoregulation in the febrile response at the central and peripheral levels and cellular events. In response to cold or heat, the brain triggers thermoregulatory responses to coping with changes in body temperature, including autonomic effectors, such as thermogenesis, vasodilation, sweating, and behavioral mechanisms, that trigger flexible, goal-oriented actions, such as seeking heat or cold, nest building, and postural extension. Infrared thermography (IRT) has proven to be a reliable method for the early detection of pathologies affecting animal health and welfare that represent economic losses for farmers. However, the standardization of protocols for IRT use is still needed. Together with the complete understanding of the physiological and behavioral responses involved in the febrile process, it is possible to have timely solutions to serious prob-lem situations. For this reason, the present review aims to analyze the new findings in pathophysiological mechanisms of the febrile process, the heat-loss mechanisms in an animal with fever, ther-moregulation, the adverse effects of fever, and recent scientific findings related to different pathol-ogies in farm animals through the use of IRT.";Animal welfare | Febrile response | Hyperthermia | Infectious process | Pathogen | Pyrogen | Thermogenesis | Thermolysis | Thermoregulation | Thermoregulatory behavior;18;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Methods: Immunohistochemistry for perilipin 1 and adipophilin was performed in 12 human tooth germs (TG), 27 conventional ameloblastoma (AM), and 8 ameloblastic carcinoma (AC) samples. Cytoplasmic staining was analyzed using an immunoreactive score (IRS), and the results were compared for the TG, AM, and AC samples by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's post-test and confirmed by Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Perilipin 1 was negative in 91.7% of the TG samples, positive in 48.2% of the AM samples, and positive in 87.5% of the AC samples. Adipophilin was positive in 100% of the TG samples, 92.6% of the AM samples, and 100% of the AC samples.

Most infectious diseases are spatially limited by the presence of the transmitter, whose abundance and survival are influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of food sources. A tool that facilitates its study is the use of Geographic Information Systems. The objective of this study was to analyze the interaction of populations of hematophagous bats and humans, through the development of a probable model of dispersal of D. rotundus based on known shelters and different environmental variables, in addition to analyzing the relationship between shelters identified for three years and their proximity to human settlements, as a process of coexistence. The study was conducted in the state of San Luis Potosí from 2014 to 2016. A total of 180 shelters of D. rotundus distributed towards the Huasteca region were identified, 80 % of these were built by man and 57 % were inhabited. A buffer of 5 km around from the location of each shelter was calculated, finding inside a total of 976 rural communities and 15 cities, with 337,836 inhabitants. The average distance from shelters to the first human settlement was 518.65 ± 11.33 m. It is necessary to continue studying the association between urbanization and the emergence of zoonoses, through the understanding of the interactions between wild animals-livestock-humans.;Coexistence | GIS | Human population | Vampire bat | Zoonoses;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It is important that mother and young establish a bond based on a learning mechanism defined as “imprinting” early after parturition during the sensitive period, on which the welfare and survival of the offspring will depend. This review aims to summarize and discuss current knowledge regarding the imprinting process, the neurobiological pathways that are triggered during this sensitive period, and the development of the cow–calf bond. Touch, hearing, vision, and smell seem to be the predominant senses involved during imprinting in buffaloes and other mammalian farm species. In buffalo, bonding is very particular due to the expression of specific behaviors, such as allo-suckling and communal rearing. In general, imprinting and the subsequent bond may be affected by the lack of experience of the mothers or dystocic parturitions, which occur most frequently with male calves and in primiparous dams. The main problems in the development of this process include lack of seeking a protected and isolated place to give birth; moving from the birth-site after parturition; insufficient postpartum care; aversion or aggressiveness towards the newborn, or abandonment of the newborn. The process can develop differently according to the species. However, the correct development of the cow–calf relationship represents, regardless of the species, a key factor for their fitness.";Animal welfare | Bonding | Buffaloes | Imprinting | Mother–young relationship;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The primary aim of this study was to examine the associations among screen-based activities, physical activity, and dietary habits in school-aged children in Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta, and Mexico City, Mexico. The secondary aim was to examine these associations across sex. The School Physical Activity and Nutrition survey was used to assess screen-based activities (TV watching, video game use, computer use), physical activity, and dietary habits. Organized activity/sports participation, unhealthy dietary habits, and household income were correlated with screen-based activities. While TV watching was associated with decreased participation in organized activity/sports participation, computer and video game use was associated with increased organized activity/sports participation. Boys engaged in more TV watching and video game use compared to girls. All screen-based activities were associated with age among boys; whereas video game and computer use were associated with higher income among girls. These findings suggest a need for sex-and age-specific strategies that acknowledge the differential use of screen-based activities across sex and age.

No evidence of MFCC has been reported during active labor, a critical stage at the end of pregnancy for the mother-child binomial. Therefore, this exploratory study compares the short-term MFCC between nonlaboring and laboring women by applying nonlinear joint symbolic dynamics (JSD). Forty-four pairs of maternal-fetal RR interbeat intervals series were longitudinally analyzed during the third trimester of pregnancy (TT, 36.5 ±1.7 weeks of gestation) and later at active parturition at term (P, 39.4 ±1.2 weeks gestation), corresponding to low-risk pregnant women (N=22). For each pair of maternal-fetal interbeat intervals series at TT and P, a word distribution density matrix was calculated to assess general and partial coupling behavior. The JSD approach revealed changes in the MFCC, permitting the identification of differences between the TT and P conditions (p < 0.0001). The general indices revealed a significant increment of the short-term MFCC at P and the probability of similar (alike) and opposite cardiovascular fluctuations. Partial indices also confirmed coupling changes between both conditions. Our results show short-term MFCC increments at P, probably influenced by the effects of the intense uterine contractile activity and other interactions on both fetal and maternal heart rhythm fluctuations. We conjecture that JSD analysis of maternal and fetal heart rate during labor may be appropriate for monitoring physiological mechanisms involved in the mother-child binomial.;Cardiac coupling | Heart rate | Human labor | Joint symbolic dynamics | Maternal-fetal interactions;0;0;;;SEP;511-6/2020-7841;Secretaría de Educación Pública

The Androgen Receptor gene is important in this pathology due to its participation, mainly, in the inguinoscrotal phase of testicular descent. We determine the length of the CAG tract in the Androgen Receptor (AR) gene in Mexican patients with nonsyndromic cryptorchidism. One hundred and 15 males were included; of these, 62 had nonsyndromic cryptorchidism and 53 were healthy volunteers. DNA was extracted from a peripheral blood samples, subsequently, the CAG tract in exon 1 of AR gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Mexican patients with nonsyndromic cryptorchidism presented 25.03 ± 2.58 repeats of CAG tract in the AR gene compared to 22.72 ± 3.17 repeats of CAG tract in Mexican healthy individuals (p≤0.0001; t value of 4.3). Furthermore, the deletion of codon 57 that corresponds to the deletion of a leucine residue at position 57 (Del L57) in the AR gene was found for the first time in a nonsyndromic cryptorchidism patient. This molecular alteration has been related previously to testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT). The CAG tract in the AR gene is longer in patients with nonsyndromic cryptorchidism than in healthy individuals, supporting the association between this polymorphism of the AR gene and nonsyndromic cryptorchidism in the Mexican population.";Androgen Receptor | CAG repeat polymorphism | Mexican patients | nonsyndromic cryptorchidism | PolyQ;1;0;;;;undefined;

Timely and comprehensive estimates of the prevalence of smoking tobacco use and attributable disease burden are needed to guide tobacco control efforts nationally and globally. Methods: We estimated the prevalence of smoking tobacco use and attributable disease burden for 204 countries and territories, by age and sex, from 1990 to 2019 as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. We modelled multiple smoking-related indicators from 3625 nationally representative surveys. We completed systematic reviews and did Bayesian meta-regressions for 36 causally linked health outcomes to estimate non-linear dose-response risk curves for current and former smokers. We used a direct estimation approach to estimate attributable burden, providing more comprehensive estimates of the health effects of smoking than previously available. Findings: Globally in 2019, 1·14 billion (95% uncertainty interval 1·13–1·16) individuals were current smokers, who consumed 7·41 trillion (7·11–7·74) cigarette-equivalents of tobacco in 2019. Although prevalence of smoking had decreased significantly since 1990 among both males (27·5% [26·5–28·5] reduction) and females (37·7% [35·4–39·9] reduction) aged 15 years and older, population growth has led to a significant increase in the total number of smokers from 0·99 billion (0·98–1·00) in 1990. Globally in 2019, smoking tobacco use accounted for 7·69 million (7·16–8·20) deaths and 200 million (185–214) disability-adjusted life-years, and was the leading risk factor for death among males (20·2% [19·3–21·1] of male deaths). 6·68 million [86·9%] of 7·69 million deaths attributable to smoking tobacco use were among current smokers. Interpretation: In the absence of intervention, the annual toll of 7·69 million deaths and 200 million disability-adjusted life-years attributable to smoking will increase over the coming decades. Substantial progress in reducing the prevalence of smoking tobacco use has been observed in countries from all regions and at all stages of development, but a large implementation gap remains for tobacco control. Countries have a clear and urgent opportunity to pass strong, evidence-based policies to accelerate reductions in the prevalence of smoking and reap massive health benefits for their citizens.

Therefore, the study was approached in two stages. In the first stage, the orchiectomy was performed in 30 adult pigs. The testicles were stored at 5.00 ˚C in physiological saline solution for 5, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hr. The spermatozoa were obtained by backflushing the vas deferens. The spermogram and fluorometric study were performed for each sample to evaluate the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) and acrosome reaction (AR). The second stage included the fertilization test, 16 prepubertal sows were selected, after synchronizing the oestrous cycle and the post-cervical artificial insemination was performed with the refrigerated sperm samples from each P-OQ time. The percentage of live sperm remained without significant changes until 96 hr P-OQ. An increase in the percentage of spermatozoa that showed a PS exposure was observed. The premature AR was evident after 72 hr. Considering that the artificial insemination was performed ensuring a minimum number of live sperms, no significant differences were observed in the number of embryos and corpora lutea. The results indicated that pig sperm collected from the epididymal tail P-OQ and stored for 5 and up to 72 hr at 5.00 ˚C had viable characteristics and maintained their fertilization ability. However, there was an increase in the loss of phospholipid asymmetry of the plasma membrane as time increased (72 and 96 hr), therefore, sperm viability was decreased.;Fertilization | Phospholipid asymmetry | Sperm | Swine;0;0;;;CONACYT;425681;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The presence of maternal obesity imposes an overload to these physiological adaptations that may result in increased risk for the development of cardiometabolic complications during and after pregnancy. The aim of this study is to describe total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), glucose, and arterial blood pressure (BP) trajectories and to analyze the association of these cardiometabolic risk indicators during pregnancy with pre-pregnancy body mass index (pBMI) and monthly gestational weight gain (MGWG). Subjects/methods: A prospective cohort study of pregnant women was conducted in Mexico City. Monthly samples of blood were taken during clinical follow-up and biochemical and blood pressure were measured during each visit. Adjusted linear mixed-effect regression models were fit to describe the trajectories of these biomarkers during pregnancy and to analyze the association with pBMI and MGWG. Results: Seven hundred and twenty women were included of which 16.6% had pre-gestational obesity, 33.2% had pre-gestational overweight, 45.8% had normal pBMI and 4.4% had pre-gestational underweight. Women with pre-gestational obesity had higher lipids concentrations in the beginning of pregnancy (TC: β̂ = 33.08, p = 0.010; TG: β̂ = 31.29, p = <0.001) but the concentrations increased less than in women with normal pBMI (TC: β̂ = −14.18, p = 0.001; TG: β̂ = −5.42, p < 0.001). By the end of pregnancy, women with pre-gestational obesity had lower concentrations of lipids than women with normal pBMI. By contrast, women with pre-gestational obesity had higher glucose concentrations and higher BP levels than women with normal pBMI over pregnancy. Conclusions: pBMI is differentially associated with longitudinal trajectories of maternal biochemical markers of cardiometabolic risk. MGWG did not significantly affect the biochemical indicators or BP trajectories. Our results suggest that pBMI is more relevant to predicting adverse cardiometabolic markers trajectories during pregnancy than MGWG.";;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;NIEHS;PAPIIT IA200712;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences

The study of the hypothalamic neuromodulation of thermoregulation offers broad areas of opportunity with practical applications that are currently being strengthened by the availability of efficacious tools like infrared thermography (IRT). These areas could include the following: understanding the effect of climate change on behavior and productivity; analyzing the effects of exercise on animals involved in sporting activities; identifying the microvascular changes that occur in response to fear, pleasure, pain, and other situations that induce stress in animals; and examining thermoregulating behaviors. This research could contribute substantially to understanding the drastic modification of environments that have severe consequences for animals, such as loss of appetite, low productivity, neonatal hypothermia, and thermal shock, among others. Current knowledge of these physiological processes and complex anatomical structures, like the nervous systems and their close relation to mechanisms of thermoregulation, is still limited. The results of studies in fields like evolutionary neuroscience of thermoregulation show that we cannot yet objectively explain even processes that on the surface seem simple, including behavioral changes and the pathways and connections that trigger mechanisms like vasodilatation and panting. In addition, there is a need to clarify the connection between emotions and thermoregulation that increases the chances of survival of some organisms.

progress of prevention and control efforts and assist with improving the precision and efficiency of targeting efforts. We aimed to assess HIV incidence and HIV mortality for all second-level administrative units across sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: In this modelling study, we developed a framework that used the geographically specific HIV prevalence data collected in seroprevalence surveys and antenatal care clinics to train a model that estimates HIV incidence and mortality among individuals aged 15–49 years. We used a model-based geostatistical framework to estimate HIV prevalence at the second administrative level in 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for 2000–18 and sought data on the number of individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) by second-level administrative unit. We then modified the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) to use these HIV prevalence and treatment estimates to estimate HIV incidence and mortality by second-level administrative unit. Findings: The estimates suggest substantial variation in HIV incidence and mortality rates both between and within countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with 15 countries having a ten-times or greater difference in estimated HIV incidence between the second-level administrative units with the lowest and highest estimated incidence levels. Across all 44 countries in 2018, HIV incidence ranged from 2·8 (95% uncertainty interval 2·1–3·8) in Mauritania to 1585·9 (1369·4–1824·8) cases per 100 000 people in Lesotho and HIV mortality ranged from 0·8 (0·7–0·9) in Mauritania to 676·5 (513·6–888·0) deaths per 100 000 people in Lesotho. Variation in both incidence and mortality was substantially greater at the subnational level than at the national level and the highest estimated rates were accordingly higher. Among second-level administrative units, Guijá District, Gaza Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV incidence (4661·7 [2544·8–8120·3]) cases per 100 000 people in 2018 and Inhassunge District, Zambezia Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV mortality rate (1163·0 [679·0–1866·8]) deaths per 100 000 people. Further, the rate of reduction in HIV incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2018, as well as the ratio of new infections to the number of people living with HIV was highly variable. Although most second-level administrative units had declines in the number of new cases (3316 [81·1%] of 4087 units) and number of deaths (3325 [81·4%]), nearly all appeared well short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths between 2010 and 2020. Interpretation: Our estimates suggest that most second-level administrative units in sub-Saharan Africa are falling short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths by 2020, which is further compounded by substantial within-country variability. These estimates will help decision makers and programme implementers expand access to ART and better target health resources to higher burden subnational areas.

DFAs have been considered beneficial for health, particularly polyunsaturated (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) exert their function on DFA metabolism by modulating gene expression, and have drawn great attention for their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review explicitly examined the effects of DFAs on miRNA expression associated with metabolic diseases, such as obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as inflammation, published in the last ten years. DFAs have been shown to induce and repress miRNA expression associated with metabolic disease and inflammation in different cell types and organisms, both in vivo and in vitro, depending on varying combinations of DFAs, doses, and the duration of treatment. However, studies are limited and heterogeneous in methodology. Additionally, recent studies demonstrated that high fat ketogenic diets, many enriched with saturated fats, do not increase serum saturated fat content in humans, and are not associated with increased inflammation. Thus, these findings shed light on the complexity of novel treatment and DFA interventions for metabolic disease and to maintain health. Further studies are needed to advance molecular therapeutic approaches, including miRNA-based strategies in human health and disease.;Cardiovascular disease | Dietary fatty acids | Inflammation | Metabolic disorders | MiRNA expression | Monounsaturated fatty acids | Polyunsaturated fatty acids;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;INPer;5895;Instituto Nacional de Perinatología

Radioresistance is one of the major causes of disease progression and mortality in cancer; therefore, it is a significant challenge in the treatment of locally advanced, recurrent and metastatic cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms that control hallmarks of cancer have a key role in the development of radiation resistance of cancer cells. Recent advances in DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling and non-coding RNAs identified in the control of signal transduction pathways in cancer and cancer stem cells have provided even greater promise in the improvement of understanding cancer radioresistance. Many epigenetic drugs that target epigenetic enzymes revert the radioresistant phenotypes decreasing the possibility that resistant cancer cells will develop refractory tumors to radiotherapy. Epigenetic profiles identified as regulators of DNA damage repair, hypoxia, cell survival, apoptosis and invasion are determinants in the development of tumor radioresistance; hence, they also are promising in personalized medicine to develop novel targeted therapies or biomarkers to follow-up the effectiveness of radiotherapy. Now, it is clear that radiotherapy can influence a complex epigenetic network for transcriptional reprogramming, enabling the cells to adapt and avoid the effect of radiotherapy. This review aims to highlight the epigenetic modifications identified in cancer radioresistance and to discuss approaches to disable epigenetic networks to increase the sensitivity and specificity of radiotherapy.";DNA methylation | Epi-miRNAs | Epigenetic | Histones | Non-coding RNAs | Radioresistance;14;0;;;ODMH;47301022;Ohio Department of Mental Health

Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has been proposed for assessing the heart response to autonomic activity, which is documented to be altered in different cardiac diseases. The objective of the study was to evaluate changes of HRV in patients with aortic stenosis by an active standing challenge. Twenty-two volunteers without alterations in the aortic valve (NAV) and twenty-five patients diagnosed with moderate and severe calcific aortic valve stenosis (AVS) participated in this cross-sectional study. Ten minute electrocardiograms were performed in a supine position and in active standing positions afterwards, to obtain temporal, spectral, and scaling HRV indices: mean value of all NN intervals (meanNN), low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) bands spectral power, and the short-term scaling indices (α1 and αsign1 ). The AVS group showed higher values of LF, LF/HF and αsign1 compared with the NAV group at supine position. These patients also expressed smaller changes in meanNN, LF, HF, LF/HF, α1, and αsign1 between positions. In conclusion, we confirmed from short-term recordings that patients with moderate and severe calcific AVS have a decreased cardiac parasympathetic supine response and that the dynamic of heart rate fluctuations is modified compared to NAV subjects, but we also evidenced that they manifest reduced autonomic adjustments caused by the active standing challenge.;Active standing | Aortic valve disease | Cardiac autonomic modulation;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;488303;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In high-income countries, sexual minorities are at a higher risk for disordered eating behaviors. It is not known whether these findings can be extrapolated to Mexico. Objective. Determine whether there are any differences in disordered eating behaviors among Mexican youth according to sexual orientation and analyze the potential role of experiences of violence and discrimination as mediators of these differences. Method. Data from a representative sample of Mexican youth (12 to 29 years old, n = 27,876) were analyzed. Three groups were identified: young people who were not in love (NIL), who were in love with people of the opposite sex (ILOS), or in love with people of the same sex (ILSS). Restrictive behaviors, secret eating, and self-induced vomiting were identified through a scale created for the survey. Results. ILSS men had a higher risk of restrictive thoughts and behaviors (B = .31), secret eating (OR = 2.21), and self-induced vomiting (OR = 3.65) than ILOS youth. Among women, there was only a difference in self-induced vomiting (RM = 2.49). In both sexes, being a young ILSS had an indirect effect on restrictive behaviors through its association with experiences of violence, discrimination at school, and sexual violence. Discussion and conclusion. Mexican sexual minority men are at a higher risk of disordered eating behaviors, whereas sexual minority women are at a higher risk of purging. Part of the differences in restrictive behaviors were explained by the increased risk for experiences of prejudice faced by sexual minority youth.;discriminación | discrimination | eating and food ingestion disorders | gender | género | inequidades | inequities | Orientación sexual | Sexual orientation | trastornos de la alimentación y de la ingestión de alimentos | violence | violencia;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Different methods have been used for their management: synthetic nematicides, organic amendments and biological control. These methods have had different levels of success. Little is known of the use of native rootstock, which could be a good alternative for tomato production. The objective of this study was to evaluate three native S. lycopersicum rootstocks (genotypes: Manzana, Ciruelo and Arriñonado) with a commercial saladette-type hybrid (Cid F1®) of indeterminate growth to determine the best combinations of rootstock and hybrid, their response in the presence of the nematode M. incognita, and their productivity under greenhouse conditions. The variables evaluated were soil nematode population, root gall index, crop yield, and fruit parameters: weight, polar and equatorial diameters, pH, electric conductivity, total soluble solids, and firmness. The combination Cid F1-Manzana genotype significantly reduced the root gall index, relative to the control, showing moderate resistance and low juvenile second-stage M. incognita (J2) nematode populations in the soil. The three rootstocks, Manzana, Ciruelo and Arriñonado, increased yield by 125.90, 97.06 and 77.5%, respectively, relative to the control. The largest diameters of the fruits were recorded when the Hybrid Cid F1® was grafted onto Manzana. The use of native rootstock with the hybrid is a viable alternative that can increase yield and fruit quality of tomatoes in systems of protected agriculture.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

The present study was conducted with high-performance Holando-Argentino cows. Our objective was to study TNF-α and its receptors pattern expression in cows from a region characterized by extreme climatic seasonality. Animals were evaluated in three periods: spring (n = 15), summer (n = 14) and autumn (n = 11). Meteorological records from a local station were used to estimate the temperature and humidity index (THI) by means of an equation previously defined. A THI higher than 68 is indicative of stressing conditions. During the summer period, the animals were exposed to 8.5 ± 1.09 h of heat stress, or THI > 68. In spring, stress hours were reduced to 1.4 ± 0.5 every day, while during the autumn, there were no recorded heat stress events. Expression of TNF-α, and its receptors was determined by qPCR. During the summer, TNF-α and its receptors expression diminished drastically compared to the rest of the year, when stressful conditions were infrequent. We conclude that animals that are not physiologically prepared to resist high temperatures might have a less efficient immune response, reinforcing the need to develop new strategies to improve animal welfare.;Cytokines | Dairy cattle | Heat stress | Immune response;7;0;;;CONICET;PIP 2014-2016;Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas

We aim to compare disorders of gaming in both diagnostic systems using a sample of young adults in Mexico. Methods: Self-administered survey to estimate the prevalence of DSM-5 IGD and ICD-11 GD in 5 Mexican universities; 7,022 first-year students who participated in the University Project for Healthy Students, part of the World Health Organization World Mental Health International College Student Initiative. Cross-tabulation, logistic regression, and item response theory were used to inform on 12- month prevalence of DSM-5 IGD and ICD-11 GD, without and with impairment. Results: The 12-month prevalence of DSM-5 IGD was 5.2% (95% CI, 4.7 to 5.8), almost twice as high as the prevalence using the ICD-11 GD criteria (2.7%; 95% CI, 2.4 to 3.1), and while adding an impairment requirement diminishes both estimates, prevalence remains larger in DSM-5. We found that DSM-5 cases detected and undetected by ICD-11 criteria were similar in demographics, comorbid mental disorders, service use, and impairment variables with the exception that cases detected by ICD-11 had a larger number of symptoms and were more likely to have probable drug dependence than undetected DSM-5 cases. Conclusion: DSM-5 cases detected by ICD-11 are mostly similar to cases undetected by ICD-11. By using ICD-11 instead of DSM-5, we may be leaving (similarly) affected people underserved.

In this work, we explore the capacity of an achiote seed extract and its main compounds to modulate the lifespan and antistress responses on Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as the mechanisms involved in these effects. Achiote lipophilic extract, bixin, and δ -tocotrienol were applied on nematodes to carry out lifespan, stress resistance, and fertility assays. The achiote seed extract increased the median and maximum lifespan up to 35% and 27% and increased resistance against oxidative and thermal stresses without adverse effects on fertility. The beneficial effects were mimicked by a bixin+ δ -tocotrienol mixture. All the effects on lifespan and stress resistance were independent of caloric restriction but dependent on the insulin/insulin growth factor-1 pathway.

Recent studies have documented that estrogens are able to modify the DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair mechanisms. On the other hand, it has been proposed that DDR machinery can be altered by estrogen signaling pathways, that can be related to cancer progression and chemoresistance.

The idea is to define path curves where the roots of a polynomial can take values by determining an initial and a final polynomial. As a consequence, structural stability and bifurcation of the system can be obtained. Structural stability is obtained by preserving the same stability of the initial and final polynomials. However, the system bifurcates by changing the stability of the final polynomial with respect to the initial polynomial. The aim is achieved by the design of a piecewise linear controller that is applied to affine linear systems. Our results are mathematically proved and numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the approach.;chaos | Monoparametric family | piecewise linear control | unstable dissipative system;3;0;;;CONACYT;A1-S-30433;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Recently, an approach for metallic superlattices based on the theory of finite periodic systems was published. Unlike most, if not all, of the published approaches that are valid in the n → 8 limit, the finite periodic systems approach is valid for any value of n, allows one to determine analytical expressions for scattering amplitudes and dispersion relations. It was shown that, for frequencies below ωp, large metallic-layer thickness, and electromagnetic fields moving along the so-called “true” angle, anomalous results with an apparent parity effect appear. We show here that these results are related to the lack of unitarity and the underlying phenomena of absorption and loss of energy. To solve this problem we present two compatible approaches, both based on the theory of finite periodic systems, which is not only more accurate, but has also the ability to reveal and predict the intra-subband resonances. In the first approach we show that by keeping complex angles, above and below ωp, the principle of flux conservation is fully satisfied. The results above ωp remain the same as in Pereyra (2020). This approach, free of assumptions, where all the information of the scattering process is preserved, gives us insight to improve the formalism where the assumption of electromagnetic fields moving along the real angles is made. In fact, we show that by taking into account the induced currents and the requirement of flux conservation, we end up with an improved approach, with new Fresnel and transmission coefficients, fully compatible with those of the complex-angle approach. The improved approach also allows one to evaluate the magnitude of the induced currents and the absorbed energy, as functions of the frequency and the superlattice parameters. We show that the resonant frequencies of intra-subband plasmons, which may be of interest for applications, in particular for biosensors, can be accurately determined. We also apply the approach for the transmission of electromagnetic wave packets, defined in the optical domain, and show that the predicted space-time positions agree extremely well with the actual positions of the wave packet centroids.;Biosensors | Induced currents and absorption | Metallic superlattices | Phase time in metallic superlattices | Plasmon resonances in optical regime | The true refraction angle in metals | Transmittance of electromagnetic fields;1;1;repositoryam;Green;APC;undefined;Association of Pathology Chairs

Employment of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is very limited and lung ultrasound (LUS) can be an alternative tool for the early evaluation of ILD. Objective: To determine the validity of LUS in the early detection of ILD in patients with SSc. Methods: Sixty-eight patients with SSc ≥18 years without respiratory symptoms were included. A rheumatologist rated the subclinical respiratory condition, another rheumatologist blinded to the clinical assessment performed the LUS. To determine validity HRCT was performed as well. Results: Prevalence of ILD in SSc patients was 41.2% in contrast to the 4.8% healthy controls (P = .0001). Variables associated with LUS and HRCT findings were anti-centromere antibodies (P = .005) and the Rodnan skin score (P = .004). A positive correlation was present between the findings of HRCT and LUS (P = .001). Sensitivity and specificity were 91.2% and 88.6% respectively. Good reliability in the LUS findings was found between observers (k = .72). Conclusions: By proving to be a valid, trustworthy and feasible alternative tool, we consider that LUS can be implemented for the early detection of ILD in SSc.;Interstitial lung disease | Lung ultrasound | Systemic sclerosis;7;0;;;;undefined;

The transit of spermatozoa through the epididymis is necessary to generate changes in the sperm membrane, such as the assembly of various carbohydrates that are added to the spermatazoan's surface to prepare it for successful fertilisation of the oocyte. No studies have yet analysed whether Cd alters the presence and distribution of these carbohydrates. We aimed to evaluate the changes induced by Cd in the distribution pattern of N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, mannose and fucose on the sperm membrane in the epididymis (e.g. caput, corpus, cauda) and if it alters the epididymal epithelium. Male Wistar pups were treated with Cd doses (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) on postnatal days 1-49. At postnatal day 90, they were humanely killed, sperm samples were obtained from the epididymis and tissue samples were taken for histological analysis. Cd concentrations in the blood and epididymis increased in proportion to the dose administered and decreased the serum testosterone levels and sperm quality. Histological analysis revealed alterations in the epithelium in all Cd-treated groups. Cd altered the distribution patterns of carbohydrates and fluorescence indices.

The poor clinical prognosis and lack of successful treatments for metastatic breast cancer patients demand the development of new tumor-selective therapies. Thus, it is necessary to develop treatments capable of releasing therapeutic agents to both primary tumors and metastases that avoid toxic side effects in normal tissue, and neural stem cells are an attractive vehicle for tracking tumor cells and delivering anti-cancer agents. The authorspreviously demonstrated that a soluble form of growth arrest specific 1 (GAS1) inhibits the growth of triple-negative breast tumors and glioblastoma. Methods: In this study, the authors engineered ReNcell CX (EMD Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) neural progenitor cells to express truncated GAS1 (tGAS1) under a tetracycline/on inducible system using lentiviral vectors. Results: Here the authors show that treatment with ReNcell-tGAS1 in combination with tetracycline decreased primary tumor growth and inhibited the formation of metastases in tumor-bearing mice by diminishing the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in orthotopic mammary gland tumors. Moreover, the authors observed that ReNcell-tGAS1 prolonged the survival of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: These data suggest that the delivery of tGAS1 by ReNcell cells could be an effective adjuvant for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.;breast cancer | gene therapy | growth arrest specific 1 | metastases | neural stem cells;2;0;;;CONACYT;1563;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Methods: Mediation analysis was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of the -514C>T LIPC gene variant on HDL-C levels, T2D risk, and body mass index (BMI), in 2105 Mexican mestizo participants. We also assessed the functional effect of the -514C>T LIPC variant on the promoter activity of a reporter gene in the HepG2 cell line. Results: Direct effects show that the -514C>T LIPC polymorphism is significantly associated with increased HDL-C plasma levels (β = 0.03; p < 0.001). The -514C>T variant resulted in an indirect protective effect on T2D risk through increasing HDL-C levels (β = − 0.03; p < 0.001).

In Mexico, food self-sufficiency is declining. Rural policies in the country have stimulated the production of cash crops to the detriment of the traditional intercropping system, the milpa. Such a decline may have negative consequences for the food security of subsistence farmers. This study aimed to assess changes in nutritional self-sufficiency over the last 30 years and the role of milpa systems in food security for two communities in the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. The study used satellite images, censuses, and field data to estimate food production. Three cropping systems, monoculture of maize, monoculture of common bean, and the milpa were compared in terms of nutrients and vitamins produced. Furthermore, a household typology was developed for each community to contrast nutritional self-sufficiency levels between the different household types. Results showed that the milpa produced more volume of food per area compared to the other systems. The milpa also produced all the nutrients and vitamins (except for B12) required to feed at least 2 persons ha-1. Monocultures of maize lacked vitamins A, B9, B12, and C, and the common bean lacked vitamins A, B12, and C. While farmers recognized the importance of the milpa, they preferred monocultures due to the reduced labor demands of this system. Households that obtained most of their income from off-farm activities had the lowest nutritional self-sufficiency. Enhancing nutritional self-sufficiency through crop diversification has the potential to not only improve the nutrition of subsistence farmers, but also to enhance ecosystem service provision, promote biodiversity conservation and restoration, and improve resilience to climate change.;;12;1;repositoryvor;Green;CGIAR;A4032.09.20;Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers

Loss-of-function mutations in the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) are an infrequent cause of primary ovarian failure. Objective: To analyze the molecular physiopathogenesis of a novel mutation in the FSHR identified in a woman with primary ovarian failure, employing in vitro and in silico approaches, and to compare the features of this dysfunctional receptor with those shown by the trafficking-defective D408Y FSHR mutant. Methods: Sanger sequencing of the FSHR cDNA was applied to identify the novel mutation. FSH-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and desensitization were tested in HEK293 cells. Receptor expression was analyzed by immunoblotting, receptor-binding assays, and flow cytometry. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to determine the in silico behavior of the mutant FSHRs. Results: A novel missense mutation (I423T) in the second transmembrane domain of the FSHR was identified in a woman with normal pubertal development but primary amenorrhea. The I423T mutation slightly impaired plasma membrane expression of the mature form of the receptor and severely impacted on cAMP/protein kinase A signaling but much less on β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Meanwhile, the D408Y mutation severely affected membrane expression, with most of the FSH receptor located intracellularly, and both signal readouts tested. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed important functional disruptions in both mutant FSHRs, mainly the loss of interhelical connectivity in the D408Y FSHR. Conclusions: Concurrently, these data indicate that conformational differences during the inactive and active states account for the distinct expression levels, differential signaling, and phenotypic expression of the I423T and D408Y mutant FSHRs.;follicle-stimulating hormone | follicle-stimulating hormone receptor | gonadotropins | inactivating mutations | primary ovarian failure;4;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

However, information on the potential of micromineral supplements in this regard is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of 20 mg (control) and 40 mg Cu (from supplemental CuSO4)/kg dietary dry matter (DM) on nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation characteristics, and enteric CH4 emissions measured with the tracing technique of sulfur hexafluoride. Six Holstein bulls were divided into two groups of three animals and assigned to one of two experimental diets in a crossover design. Percentages of apparent digestibility of DM, neutral detergent fiber, and N did not differ (P>0.05) between treatments. Supplemental Cu decreased (P<0.001) total tract digestibility of Cu by 25%. There were no differences (P>0.05) between treatments in ruminal fluid pH or, acetate:propionate ratio. Emission of CH4 tended (P<0.1) to decrease by 23% with supplemental Cu. This study showed that 40 mg Cu/kg dietary DM is a feasible dietary level in cattle, because supplemental Cu from CuSO4 did not impair nutrient digestibility and tended to decrease enteric CH4 emissions.;Cattle | Copper | Digestion | Methane | Sulfur hexafluoride;1;0;;;;undefined;

Recent data suggest that tissue dysfunction, not just acute damage, may initiate or perpetuate an inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to find out if any neurological dysfunction in preschool children secondary to damage generated during the perinatal period is associated with the magnitude of perinatal risks and long-term modifications in the serum concentrations of inflammatory molecules. The participants, aged 1–4 years, were on neurodevelopmental follow-up and rehabilitation therapy from the first three months of life and had no acute disease data. We classified the children into three groups according to the importance of their perinatal risks: low, medium, and high. The results show that 1) the magnitude of perinatal risks correlated with the severity of neurological dysfunction; 2) the greatest changes in the concentrations of the molecules of the inflammatory process were associated with the most altered neurological signs. This suggests that persistent nervous system dysfunction keeps inflammatory responses active even in the absence of an acute process of infection or damage.";inflammation | neurodevelopment | neurological signs | perinatal risks | sequelae;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Globally comparable, annual, local estimates of routine first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) coverage are critical for understanding geographically precise immunity patterns, progress towards the targets of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), and high-risk areas amid disruptions to vaccination programmes caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)5–8. Here we generated annual estimates of routine childhood MCV1 coverage at 5 × 5-km2 pixel and second administrative levels from 2000 to 2019 in 101 LMICs, quantified geographical inequality and assessed vaccination status by geographical remoteness. After widespread MCV1 gains from 2000 to 2010, coverage regressed in more than half of the districts between 2010 and 2019, leaving many LMICs far from the GVAP goal of 80% coverage in all districts by 2019. MCV1 coverage was lower in rural than in urban locations, although a larger proportion of unvaccinated children overall lived in urban locations; strategies to provide essential vaccination services should address both geographical contexts. These results provide a tool for decision-makers to strengthen routine MCV1 immunization programmes and provide equitable disease protection for all children.";;35;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0084;National Institutes of Health

A combination of pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine is the treatment of choice; nevertheless, these two drugs produce severe side effects and are only effective against acute toxoplasmosis, hence, less toxic novel compounds with anti-toxoplasma activity are greatly needed. Natural compounds seem to be a promising source to identify lead compounds against T. gondii. In this review, the in vitro and in vivo activities of extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds obtained from different plants are described. In addition, some biological and pathological generalities of the parasite are reviewed as well. Data were obtained from a bibliographic search throughout digital faculty libraries, Google Scholar search engine, Science Direct, SciELO databases, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Founded records include the evaluation of 58 extracts, 14 fractions, and 7 compounds belonging to 53 species of 33 plant families. Predominant studies were made on in vivo RH T. gondii tachyzoites strain and very few in in vivo models of both acute and chronic toxoplasmosis.

In this study, we investigated the effect of disease and short-term SupplO 2 on cardiovascular and respiratory autonomic regulation. Linear and nonlinear indices were extracted from the beat-to-beat variability of heart rate (HR), systolic (SYS) blood pressure and respiration (RESP) in IPF patients and healthy subjects spontaneously breathing ambient air (AA) and during SupplO 2 at 3 L/min. It was found that the effects on autonomic nervous systems (ANS) regulation were better demonstrated by the Granger causality (GC) method. GC was significantly higher (p<0.01) in patients compared to controls for the interactions RESP→SYS and BBI→SYS.Clinical Relevance - Short-term SupplO2 in IPF could adversely affect systolic blood pressure variability in particular.

Nutritional status and diet have a major impact on the COVID-19 disease process, mainly because of the bidirectional interaction between gut microbiota and lung, that is, the gut-lung axis. Individuals with inadequate nutritional status have a pre-existing imbalance in the gut microbiota and immunity as seen in obesity, diabetes, hypertension and other chronic diseases. Communication between the gut microbiota and lungs or other organs and systems may trigger worse clinical outcomes in viral respiratory infections. Thus, this review addresses new insights into the use of probiotics and prebiotics as a preventive nutritional strategy in managing respiratory infections such as COVID-19 and highlighting their anti-inflammatory effects against the main signs and symptoms associated with COVID-19. Literature search was performed through PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science databases; relevant clinical articles were included. Significant randomised clinical trials suggest that specific probiotics and/or prebiotics reduce diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, cough, sore throat, fever, and viral infection complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. These beneficial effects are linked with modulation of the microbiota, products of microbial metabolism with antiviral activity, and immune-regulatory properties of specific probiotics and prebiotics through Treg cell production and function. There is a need to conduct clinical and pre-clinical trials to assess the combined effect of consuming these components and undergoing current therapies for COVID-19.";COVID-19 | Immunity | Microbiota | Nutritional status | Viral infections;11;0;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Adenosine acts through specific receptors and is a negative inotropic and chronotropic agent. Blockage of its cardiac receptors can cause tachycardia (with arrhythmogenic potential) due to the intense activity of β1 receptors. In terms of tissue protection, caffeine inhibits hyperoxia-induced pulmonary inflammation by decreasing proinflammatory cytokine expression in animal models. The protection that caffeine provides to tissues is not limited to the CNS, as studies have demonstrated that it generates attenuation of inflammatory effects in pulmonary tissue. It inhibits the effects of some pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevents functional and structural changes.";Animal model | Caffeine | Cardiorespiratory effect | Tissue protection;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

CPV has developed several strategies to evade innate immune response mediated by type I interferons (IFN-I) to achieve a successful infection. The aim of this work was to evaluate the capability of CVP-2c to evade the IFN-I mediated response in infected cells. To establish the role of this response, the gene expression of interferon β (IFNβ), IFIT1, IFIT3, MAVS, and STING were estimated in MDCK cells infected with CPV-2c. Viral replication and gene expression was evaluated by quantitative PCR, also, a treatment with IFN-I (interferon omega) was included to confirm the role of IFN-I during CPV infection. The results revealed that CPV-2c infection stimulates the expression of IFNβ moderately, in these cells. Due to low IFNβ induction, the IFIT1 and IFIT3 expression were also low, and therefore CPV-2c was able to replicate in these cells. However, when the cells were treated with exogenous IFN-I, the IFNβ expression was higher, leading to an increased gene expression of IFIT1 and IFIT3, responsible for antiviral control. The overexpression of these proteins reduced the expression of NS1 and VP2 viral genes and hence viral replication. MAVS and STING expression on infected cells showed a mild increase compared to IFNβ, suggesting that the viral infection could partially modify its expression. All results obtained in this study showed that during CPV-2c infection in MDCK cells, the IFNβ expression was altered since this cytokine is one of the most critical factors for the control and inhibition of viral replication.;Antiviral immunity | Canine parvovirus | IFNβ | Viral pathogenesis;0;0;;;CONACYT;469811;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Even though there are numerous results in the deterministic case, there are few results for the behavior of numerical solutions in a population dynamic with random fluctuations. First, we show, using the Euler-Maruyama scheme, that the boundedness of numerical solutions and the convergence of the scheme are preserved in the stochastic case. Second, we analyze a property of the long-term behavior of a Lotka-Volterra system with stochastic environmental fluctuations known as turnpike property. In optimal control theory, the optimal solutions dwell mostly in the neighborhood of a balanced equilibrium path, corresponding to the optimal steady-state solution. Our study shows, by means of the Stochastic Maximum Principle, that this turnpike property is preserved, when the noise in the system is small. Numerical simulations are implemented to support our results.;;1;1;;;;undefined;

Material and methods: Data sources: Medline, Science Direct, SciELO, ProQuest, and EBSCOhost databases were searched for articles published between 1986 and 2020. Study selection: Articles were included if they were carried out with healthy adult athletes of different levels of sports experience, in which the association of negative EB and low EA with SHC and with EII was evaluated. Study Appraisal and Synthesis: Of 198 records identified, 61 studies were assessed, and 26 documents met the inclusion criteria. Results: Similar associations between EB and EA (directly measured) with basal concentrations of testosterone, TNF- , and amenorrhea's presence, but not with estradiol and α IL-6, were obtained. EA (directly measured), compared to low EA surrogates, was associated with SHC in fewer studies (6 versus 11). At rest, highly trained athletes with low EB or low EA, compared to their counterparts with an adequate energy intake, showed lower levels of LH and estradiol, but not of progesterone and IL-6; although inconsistent results of testosterone, FSH, TNF-α, and amenorrhea's presence. Conclusions: The methodology for evaluating or interpreting EB or EA and biomarkers seems to determine differences between the studies' results.

Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as a public health concern on the American continent during late 2015. As the number of infected grew so did the concerns about its capability to cause long-term damage especially with the appearance of the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Proteins from the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were proposed as the cellular receptors, however, due to the ability of the virus to infect a variety of cell lines different strategies to elucidate the tropism of the virus should be investigated. Hypothesis. Pseudotyping is a powerful tool to interrogate the ability of the glycoprotein (GP) to permit entry of viruses. Aim. We aimed to establish a highly tractable pseudotype model using lenti- and retro-viral backbones to investigate the entry pathway of ZIKV. Methodology. We used different glycoprotein constructs and different lenti- or retro-viral backbones, in a matrix of ratios to investigate production of proteins and functional pseudotypes. Results. Varying the ratio of backbone and glycoprotein plasmids did not yield infectious pseudotypes. Moreover, the supplementation of the ZIKV protease or the substitution of the backbone had no positive impact on the infectivity. We showed production of the proteins in producer cells implying the lack of infectious pseudotypes is due to a lack of successful glycoprotein incorporation, rather than lack of protein production. Conclusion. In line with other reports, we were unable to successfully produce infectious pseudotypes using the variety of methods described. Other strategies may be more suitable in the development of an efficient pseudotype model for ZIKV and other flaviviruses.;Glycoprotein | Pseudotype | Zika virus;0;0;repositoryvor;Green;MRC;MR/R010307/1;Medical Research Council

As the diagnosis confirmation is performed by a postmortem neuropathological examination of the brain, this disease can be confused with other types of dementia at early stages. About 860,000 Mexicans are affected by dementia, most of them with insufficient access to adequate comprehensive health care services. Plasma biomarkers could be a rapid option for early diagnosis of the disease. Objective: This study aimed to analyze some plasma biomarkers (amyloid-β, tau, and lipids) in Mexican AD patients and control subjects with no associated neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: Plasma amyloid-β peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42), total and phosphorylated tau protein (T-tau and P-tau), and cholesterol and triglyceride levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in AD patients and control subjects. Results: In Mexican AD patients, we found significantly lower levels of Aβ42 (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. In contrast, significantly higher levels of P-tau (p < 0.05) and triglycerides (p < 0.05) were observed in AD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the severity of dementia and plasma P-tau levels, Aβ42/Aβ40 and P-tau/T-tau ratios, and triglycerides concentrations. This correlation increased gradually with cognitive decline. Conclusion: The detection of these plasma biomarkers is an initial step in searching for a timely, less invasive, and cost-efficient diagnosis in Mexicans.;Alzheimer's disease | amyloid-β | early diagnosis | Mexican patients | tau protein;1;0;;;CONACYT;99096803;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Three hundred and thirty-six (336) Holstein-Friesian (780 ± 36 kg BW; which had lactated more than twice) were sampled by coccygeal venipuncture, 7 d before, and 7 and 14 d after parturition. For each sample and metabolite serum concentrations were stratified in thresholds and related to MY. When BHBA levels were high 7 d before parturition and were related to MY at d-7 postpartum, it was observed that 11.00 % of the cows lost 0.370 kg d-1 of milk. In contrast, no relationship was observed between BHBA prepartum and MY on d-14 of lactation. It was not observed any association between high NEFA and low Ca2+ levels prepartum and MY. NEFA concentrations ≥ 0.5 mmol L-1 on d-7 before calving were 7.6 more susceptible for lameness incidence (P≤ 0.01), and when BHBA ≥ 0.8 mmol L-1 cows were 2.4 times more likely to develop ketosis (P≤0.05) in the first 60 d in milk. In brief, data indicate that a high proportion of cows are above the thresholds of β-hydroxybutyrate and non-esterified fatty acids, and are also deficient in calcium, when determined one week before parturition.

During the first week, the sheep received daily water ad libitum. During the second and third week, the sheep received 60% daily water in relation to the first 7 days intake. Analysis of variance was used to compare the mean values between sampling days. Stepwise regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between the biochemical analytes. The glucose (GLU), total cholesterol (COL-T), triglycerides (TAG), urea, albumin (ALB), total protein (PROT-T), sodium ion (Na+), creatine kinase (CK), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and aldosterone (Aldo), were determined.

Since its genome was sequenced, several molecular tools have been developed to study the mechanisms behind this outstanding and extraordinary ability. The complexity of its genome due to its sheer size and the disproportionate expansion of a large number of repetitive elements, may be a key factor at play during tissue remodeling and regeneration mechanisms. Transcriptomic analysis has provided information to identify candidate genes networks and pathways that might define successful or failed tissue regeneration. Nevertheless, the epigenetic machinery that may participate in this phenomenon has largely not been studied. In this review, we outline a broad overview of both genetic and epigenetic molecular processes related to regeneration in axolotl, from the macroscopic to the molecular level. We also explore the epigenetic mechanisms behind regenerative pathways, and its potential importance in future regeneration research. Altogether, understanding the genomics and global regulation in axolotl will be key for elucidating the special biology of this organism and the fantastic phenomenon that is regeneration.;Ambystoma mexicanum | Epigenetic processes | Molecular | Regeneration;3;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;284748;

This study aims to critically review epidemiological data on the prevalence of dental caries in Latin American and Caribbean countries (LACC) and its impact on the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of the population. Although the majority of national surveys did not include all age groups and several countries reported a reduction in the prevalence of cavitated carious lesions, most nations still exhibited a high burden of decayed teeth. OHRQoL evaluation was limited to children and older adults only, and was not included in any national survey. Study heterogeneity and methodological issues hindered comparison of evidence between studies and over time, and updating national level data on caries prevalence and its impact on OHRQoL should be prioritized in LACCs.;Caribbean Region | Dental Caries | Epidemiology | Latin America | Quality of Life;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;IADR;undefined;International Association for Dental Research

The knowledge of the chemical composition of the various microbial structures and the biological activity they trigger is decisive to know its origin and pathogenic aspects. Therefore, the magnitude of the damage caused by these bacteria is the consequence of their recognition and response to these pathogenicity factors, as well as by the host s resistance mechanisms. In addition to the great induction capacity of biological processes associated with their structural components, actinomycetes have developed various strategies that are associated with their virulence, such as: survival in phagocytic cells, deviation of apoptotic mechanisms towards necrosis cell, biofilm formation, release of extracellular vesicles, induction of extracellular traps, release of enzymes and release of toxins. This paper presents some evidence that allows us to understand the host-parasite relationship and that in the future can be considered possible therapeutic targets for the design of new strategies in the treatment of these infections.;Actinomycetes | Mycobacterium | Nocardia | Pathogenicity;0;0;;;;undefined;

Sensitisation, or an enhanced response to painful stimuli, is a well-discussed phenomenon in the human medical literature, which can arise from previous injury to an area, inflammatory reactions, or previous overstimulation of the stress axes. A number of events that occur prior to arrival at, or in the slaughterhouse, may lead to presence of these factors. This includes previous on-farm pathology, injuries arising from transport and handling and lack of habituation to humans. Whilst there is limited evidence of a direct effect of these on the processes of sensitisation in animals at slaughter, by analogy with the human neurobiology literature the connection seems plausible. In this review a neurobiological approach is taken to discuss this hypothesis in the light of basic science, and extrapolations from existing literature on the slaughter of ruminants. To confirm the postulated link between events at slaughter, and processes of hypersensitisation, further dedicated study is required.;Abattoir | Animal welfare | Cattle | Halal | Kosher | Pain | River buffalo | Sensitisation | Shechita | Stunning;11;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The study identifies that the publication of the review period duration is a consolidated practice in Latin America: in 2005, 36.6% of scientific articles published it, in contrast to 94.2% in 2018. Although the editorial practice has been consolidated, the fact that the duration of the peer review process has increased in all areas, is a big concern: Social Sciences show the highest increase with 66.5%, compared to 62.5% for Humanities and 5.2% for Sciences; in 2018, Social Sciences take 213.3 days, compared to 162.4 days taken by Humanities and 205.1 by Sciences. The study comprises a study period of 14 years and a scientific output of more than 500 Latin American journals, a circumstance that enables the findings to be considered as representative of the areas and of the region.

Thirty-six male Pelibuey lambs (25.21 ± 0.96 kg BW) were housed in individual pens during a 56-day feeding period and were randomly assigned to four treatments: (1) Control (CON): Basal diet without HM; (2) HM1: CON + 1 g of HM kg−1 dry matter (DM); (3) HM2: CON + 2 g of HM kg−1 DM; and (4) HM3: CON + 3 g of HM kg−1 DM. Data were analyzed using the GLM (General Linear Model) procedure of statistical analysis system (SAS), and linear and quadratic effects were tested to evaluate the effects of the HM level. A quadratic increase was observed in the dry matter intake and in daily weight gain (p < 0.05) of lambs fed with HM2 and HM1, respectively. However, final body weight, body condition, carcass characteristics, and meat quality were similar among treatments (p > 0.05). It was observed a linear increase (p < 0.05) in the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. Lymphocytes in blood from lambs supplemented with the HM1 diet increased and segmented neutrophils decreased compared to lambs receiving the CON treatment (p < 0.05). The concentration of uric acid in the blood had a linear increase (p <0.05) and the serum creatinine level decreased (p < 0.05) as the HM dietary dose increased. In conclusion, dietary inclusion of 2 and 1 g of HM kg−1 of DM improves feed consumption and daily weight gain, respectively, without affecting carcass characteristics, meat quality, and health status on finishing lambs.";Biochemical profile | Fattening lamb | Hematological profile | Meat quality;5;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

However, this protein has been associated with mechanisms of tumorigenesis in several neoplasms. The expression patterns and roles of caveolin-1 in the oral epithelium and in embryonic and odontogenic tumor tissues are still unclear. Material and Methods: The expression of caveolin-1 was evaluated in samples of the normal gingival epithelium (n=7), human tooth germ (TG) (n=12), ameloblastoma (AM) (n=83), and ameloblastic carcinoma (AC) (n=9) by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, AM samples were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results: Most TG (91.7%), AM (73.5%) and AC (100%) samples showed diverse patterns of immunohistochemical positivity for caveolin-1, while only one gingival sample was positive. The transcript levels of cav-1 were significantly upregulated by 14.9-fold in AM tissue (P = 0.0014) compared to those in normal gingival epithelial tissue, as shown by qRT-PCR. Presence of caveolin-1 protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The caveolin-1 immunoexpression patterns throughout the stages of TG show its importance during odontogenesis. Conclusions: The overexpression of caveolin-1 in AM and AC compared to its expression in normal gingival epithelium (adult tissue) suggests a possible role of caveolin-1 in protumoral events, but due to the similar immunoexpression observed in AM and AC, caveolin-1 may not necessarily participate in the malignant transformation process. However, future studies are needed to clarify and confirm these hypotheses.;Ameloblastic carcinoma | Ameloblastoma | Caveolin-1 | Immunohistochemistry | Real-time polymerase chain reaction;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Currently, the study of the affective states (emotions) of nonhuman animals is attracting great scientific interest focused primarily on negative experiences such as pain, fear, and suffering, which animals experience in different stages of their lives or during scientific research. Studies underway today seek to establish methods of evaluation that can accurately measure pain and then develop effective treatments for it, because the techniques available up to now are not sufficiently precise. One innovative technology that has recently been incorporated into veterinary medicine for the specific purpose of studying pain in animals is called infrared thermography (IRT), a technique that works by detecting and measuring levels of thermal radiation at different points on the body’s surface with high sensitivity. Changes in IRT images are associated mainly with blood perfusion, which is modulated by the mechanisms of vasodilatation and vasoconstriction. IRT is an efficient, noninvasive method for evaluating and controlling pain, two critical aspects of animal welfare in biomedical research. The aim of the present review is to compile and analyze studies of infrared thermographic changes associated with pain in laboratory research involving animals.;Animal welfare | Animals | Pain | Thermal images | Vascular change;18;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Pharmacological treatments do not reduce Aβ aggregation neither restore learning and memory. Noninvasive techniques have emerged as an alternative to treat AD, such as stimulation with electromagnetic fields (EMF) that decrease Aβ deposition and reverses cognitive impairment in AD mice, even though some studies showed side effects on parallel magnetic fields stimulation. As a new approach of magnetic field (MF) stimulation, vortex magnetic fields (VMF) have been tested inducing a random movement of charged biomolecules in cells, promoting cell viability and apparently safer than parallel magnetic fields. In this study we demonstrate the effect of VMF on Aβ aggregation. The experimental strategy includes, i) design and construction of a coil capable to induce VMF, ii) evaluation of VMF stimulation on Aβ peptide induced-fibrils-formation, iii) evaluation of VMF stimulation on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line in the presence of Aβ peptide. We demonstrated for the first time that Aβ aggregation exposed to VMF during 24 h decreased ~ 86% of Aβ fibril formation compared to control. Likewise, VMF stimulation reduced Aβ fibrils-cytotoxicity and increase SH-SY5Y cell viability. These data establish the basis for future investigation that involve VMF as inhibitor of Aβ-pathology and indicate the therapeutic potential of VMF for AD treatment.;Alzheimer’s disease | amyloid β plaques | magnetic stimulation | Rodin coil | Thioflavin-t assay;5;0;;;;undefined;

Objective: To determine and compare the effect of low-flow acute supplemental oxygen on the hemodynamics of IPF patients and matched healthy subjects. Methods: Descriptive and comparative study in 20 IPF-patients and 19 Control-subjects, (60-80 years old) breathing ambient air followed by acute nasal low-flow (3 L/min) supplemental oxygen. Non-invasive methods were used during the supine position to evaluate oxygen saturation, heart rate, stroke volume index, cardiac output index, total peripheral resistance and arterial blood pressure. Results: Breathing ambient air, IPF (vs. Control) presented lower values in stroke volume index (38.7 [29.4–43.2] vs. 45.4 [38.4–50.9] mL•kg-1•m2; p=0.009) and cardiac output index (2.484 [2.268 – 2.946] vs. 2.857 [2.628 – 3.054] L•min−1•m−2; p=0.028), with higher total peripheral resistance (1644 [1559–2076] vs. 1505 [1366–1784] dyne•s•cm−5; p=0.017). During supplemental oxygen (vs. ambient air), both groups increased oxygen saturation above 94% (p<0.001) while heart rate decreased about 6 to 8% (p<0.001); stroke volume index increased around 7% in the Control-group (p=0.004) but only 1% in the IPF-group (p=0.017). In addition, IPF showed increments in total peripheral resistance (1644 [1559–2076] vs. 1706 [1554–2278] dyne•s•cm−5; p=0.017) with subsequent decrements in cardiac output index (2.484 [2.268 – 2.946] vs. 2.362 [2.139 – 2.664] L•min−1•m−2; p<0.001). Conclusion: Low-flow acute supplemental oxygen in IPF causes a meaningful decrement in cardiac output due to greater reduction in heart rate and increment in total peripheral resistance than matched healthy subjects.

Convalescent sera of hamsters, dogs, and cows showed the presence of IgG antibodies, recognizing a recombinant version of this protein expressed in Escherichia coli (rGspDLC) in Western blot assays. In a pilot vaccination study, a group of eight hamsters was immunized on days zero and 14 with 50 µg of rGspDLC mixed with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (FIA). On day 28 of the study, 1,000 LD50 (Lethal Dose 50%) of a virulent strain of Leptospira interrogans serovar Canicola (LOCaS46) were inoculated by an intraoral submucosal route (IOSM). Seventy-five percent protection against disease (p = 0.017573, Fisher’s exact test) and 50% protection against infection were observed in this group of vaccinated hamsters. In contrast, 85% of non-vaccinated hamsters died six to nine days after the challenge.

There are different hypotheses about the women and nonhuman mammals’ motivation towards placentophagia, but few have been subject to hypotheses testing. In women, the controversy continues; on the one hand, researchers attribute benefits like increased breast milk, weight gain in newborns, decreased postpartum depression and fatigue, and improved mothers’ mood. In contrast, bacterial or viral infections, hormonal, or trace elements that could become toxic for both the mother and baby are reported as possible health risks. Other reports argue a lack of scientific rigor to support the self-reported benefits of placentophagia. Also, the way the placenta is prepared (raw, cooked, dehydrated, processed, or encapsulated) alters its components, and thus the desired effects. This review provides relevant information and the different hypotheses and points of view around placentophagia.

Study design: The study design is an observational study of consecutive COVID-19 cases that were treated in Mexican healthcare units and hospitals between February 27 and April 27, 2020. Methods: Epidemiological, clinical and sociodemographic data were analysed from outpatients and hospitalised patients. Cox regression models were used to analyse the risk of mortality after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Results: In total, 15,529 patients with COVID-19 were characterised; 62.6% of patients were aged older than 40 years, 57.8% were men and 1.4% were of indigenous ethnicity. A high proportion had a history of diabetes (18.4%), hypertension (21.9%) and obesity (20.9%). Among hospitalised patients, 11.2% received health care in the intensive care unit. Advanced age, male sex, indigenous ethnicity and having a history of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, were significantly associated with a high risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diabetes and obesity were the comorbidities most highly associated with death through the models used in this study. Moreover, living in Mexico City and Mexico State (where there is easy access to medical services) and walking (rather than driving or getting public transport) were negatively associated with mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Diabetes, hypertension and obesity combined with older age, male sex and indigenous ethnicity increase the risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Mexican population. It is recommended that the incidence of COVID-19 is monitored in indigenous communities, and access to health services is increased nationwide.";Chronic diseases | COVID-19 | Risk factors | SARS-CoV-2 | Vulnerable populations;11;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

A successful intervention to prevent this condition has been exercise-based therapy. Metformin (MTF), an anti-diabetic drug with pleiotropic effects, is known to retain redox homeostasis. However, the combined use of MTF with exercise has shown controversial experimental results. Our research group has shown that MTF-treatment does not limit the benefits provided by exercise, probably by inducing a hormetic response. Hence, our aim was to evaluate the effect of exercise in combination with MTF-treatment on the redox state of old female Wistar rats. Animals were divided into six groups; three groups preformed exercise on a treadmill for 5 days/week for 20 months and the other three were sedentary. Also, two groups of each, exercised and sedentary animals were treated with MTF for 6 or 12 months correspondingly, beside the untreated groups. Rats were euthanized at 24 months. Muscular functionality was analyzed as the relation between the lean mass free of bone with respect to the grip strength. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase content, enzymatic activity and redox state were determined in the gastrocnemius muscle. Our results showed that the exercised group treated with MTF for 12 months presented higher GSH/GSSG rate and high antioxidant scavenging power in contrast to the MTF-treatment for 6 months, where the beneficial effect was less noticeable.

GBD 2019 covered 204 countries and territories, as well as first administrative level disaggregations for 22 countries, from 1990 to 2019. Because GBD is highly standardised and comprehensive, spanning both fatal and non-fatal outcomes, and uses a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of hierarchical disease and injury causes, the study provides a powerful basis for detailed and broad insights on global health trends and emerging challenges. GBD 2019 incorporates data from 281 586 sources and provides more than 3·5 billion estimates of health outcome and health system measures of interest for global, national, and subnational policy dialogue. All GBD estimates are publicly available and adhere to the Guidelines on Accurate and Transparent Health Estimate Reporting. From this vast amount of information, five key insights that are important for health, social, and economic development strategies have been distilled.

with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries. Methods: GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution. Findings: Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990–2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0–9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10–24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10–24 years were also in the top ten in the 25–49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50–74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI. Interpretation: As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.

on human health are important to identify where public health is making progress and in which cases current efforts are inadequate. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a standardised and comprehensive assessment of the magnitude of risk factor exposure, relative risk, and attributable burden of disease. Methods: GBD 2019 estimated attributable mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 87 risk factors and combinations of risk factors, at the global level, regionally, and for 204 countries and territories. GBD uses a hierarchical list of risk factors so that specific risk factors (eg, sodium intake), and related aggregates (eg, diet quality), are both evaluated. This method has six analytical steps. (1) We included 560 risk–outcome pairs that met criteria for convincing or probable evidence on the basis of research studies. 12 risk–outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 no longer met inclusion criteria and 47 risk–outcome pairs for risks already included in GBD 2017 were added based on new evidence. (2) Relative risks were estimated as a function of exposure based on published systematic reviews, 81 systematic reviews done for GBD 2019, and meta-regression. (3) Levels of exposure in each age-sex-location-year included in the study were estimated based on all available data sources using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression method, or alternative methods. (4) We determined, from published trials or cohort studies, the level of exposure associated with minimum risk, called the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. (5) Attributable deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were computed by multiplying population attributable fractions (PAFs) by the relevant outcome quantity for each age-sex-location-year. (6) PAFs and attributable burden for combinations of risk factors were estimated taking into account mediation of different risk factors through other risk factors. Across all six analytical steps, 30 652 distinct data sources were used in the analysis. Uncertainty in each step of the analysis was propagated into the final estimates of attributable burden. Exposure levels for dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous risk factors were summarised with use of the summary exposure value to facilitate comparisons over time, across location, and across risks. Because the entire time series from 1990 to 2019 has been re-estimated with use of consistent data and methods, these results supersede previously published GBD estimates of attributable burden. Findings: The largest declines in risk exposure from 2010 to 2019 were among a set of risks that are strongly linked to social and economic development, including household air pollution; unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; and child growth failure. Global declines also occurred for tobacco smoking and lead exposure. The largest increases in risk exposure were for ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index. In 2019, the leading Level 2 risk factor globally for attributable deaths was high systolic blood pressure, which accounted for 10·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 9·51–12·1) deaths (19·2% [16·9–21·3] of all deaths in 2019), followed by tobacco (smoked, second-hand, and chewing), which accounted for 8·71 million (8·12–9·31) deaths (15·4% [14·6–16·2] of all deaths in 2019). The leading Level 2 risk factor for attributable DALYs globally in 2019 was child and maternal malnutrition, which largely affects health in the youngest age groups and accounted for 295 million (253–350) DALYs (11·6% [10·3–13·1] of all global DALYs that year). The risk factor burden varied considerably in 2019 between age groups and locations. Among children aged 0–9 years, the three leading detailed risk factors for attributable DALYs were all related to malnutrition. Iron deficiency was the leading risk factor for those aged 10–24 years, alcohol use for those aged 25–49 years, and high systolic blood pressure for those aged 50–74 years and 75 years and older. Interpretation: Overall, the record for reducing exposure to harmful risks over the past three decades is poor. Success with reducing smoking and lead exposure through regulatory policy might point the way for a stronger role for public policy on other risks in addition to continued efforts to provide information on risk factor harm to the general public.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 produced updated and comprehensive demographic assessments of the key indicators of fertility, mortality, migration, and population for 204 countries and territories and selected subnational locations from 1950 to 2019. Methods: 8078 country-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 938 surveys, 349 censuses, and 238 other sources were identified and used to estimate age-specific fertility. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) was used to generate age-specific fertility rates for 5-year age groups between ages 15 and 49 years. With extensions to age groups 10–14 and 50–54 years, the total fertility rate (TFR) was then aggregated using the estimated age-specific fertility between ages 10 and 54 years. 7417 sources were used for under-5 mortality estimation and 7355 for adult mortality. ST-GPR was used to synthesise data sources after correction for known biases. Adult mortality was measured as the probability of death between ages 15 and 60 years based on vital registration, sample registration, and sibling histories, and was also estimated using ST-GPR. HIV-free life tables were then estimated using estimates of under-5 and adult mortality rates using a relational model life table system created for GBD, which closely tracks observed age-specific mortality rates from complete vital registration when available. Independent estimates of HIV-specific mortality generated by an epidemiological analysis of HIV prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance and other sources were incorporated into the estimates in countries with large epidemics. Annual and single-year age estimates of net migration and population for each country and territory were generated using a Bayesian hierarchical cohort component model that analysed estimated age-specific fertility and mortality rates along with 1250 censuses and 747 population registry years. We classified location-years into seven categories on the basis of the natural rate of increase in population (calculated by subtracting the crude death rate from the crude birth rate) and the net migration rate. We computed healthy life expectancy (HALE) using years lived with disability (YLDs) per capita, life tables, and standard demographic methods. Uncertainty was propagated throughout the demographic estimation process, including fertility, mortality, and population, with 1000 draw-level estimates produced for each metric. Findings: The global TFR decreased from 2·72 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·66–2·79) in 2000 to 2·31 (2·17–2·46) in 2019. Global annual livebirths increased from 134·5 million (131·5–137·8) in 2000 to a peak of 139·6 million (133·0–146·9) in 2016. Global livebirths then declined to 135·3 million (127·2–144·1) in 2019. Of the 204 countries and territories included in this study, in 2019, 102 had a TFR lower than 2·1, which is considered a good approximation of replacement-level fertility. All countries in sub-Saharan Africa had TFRs above replacement level in 2019 and accounted for 27·1% (95% UI 26·4–27·8) of global livebirths. Global life expectancy at birth increased from 67·2 years (95% UI 66·8–67·6) in 2000 to 73·5 years (72·8–74·3) in 2019. The total number of deaths increased from 50·7 million (49·5–51·9) in 2000 to 56·5 million (53·7–59·2) in 2019. Under-5 deaths declined from 9·6 million (9·1–10·3) in 2000 to 5·0 million (4·3–6·0) in 2019. Global population increased by 25·7%, from 6·2 billion (6·0–6·3) in 2000 to 7·7 billion (7·5–8·0) in 2019. In 2019, 34 countries had negative natural rates of increase; in 17 of these, the population declined because immigration was not sufficient to counteract the negative rate of decline. Globally, HALE increased from 58·6 years (56·1–60·8) in 2000 to 63·5 years (60·8–66·1) in 2019. HALE increased in 202 of 204 countries and territories between 2000 and 2019. Interpretation: Over the past 20 years, fertility rates have been dropping steadily and life expectancy has been increasing, with few exceptions. Much of this change follows historical patterns linking social and economic determinants, such as those captured by the GBD Socio-demographic Index, with demographic outcomes. More recently, several countries have experienced a combination of low fertility and stagnating improvement in mortality rates, pushing more populations into the late stages of the demographic transition. Tracking demographic change and the emergence of new patterns will be essential for global health monitoring.

quality, without experiencing financial hardship. Making progress towards UHC is a policy priority for both countries and global institutions, as highlighted by the agenda of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and WHO's Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13). Measuring effective coverage at the health-system level is important for understanding whether health services are aligned with countries' health profiles and are of sufficient quality to produce health gains for populations of all ages. Methods: Based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we assessed UHC effective coverage for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Drawing from a measurement framework developed through WHO's GPW13 consultation, we mapped 23 effective coverage indicators to a matrix representing health service types (eg, promotion, prevention, and treatment) and five population-age groups spanning from reproductive and newborn to older adults (≥65 years). Effective coverage indicators were based on intervention coverage or outcome-based measures such as mortality-to-incidence ratios to approximate access to quality care; outcome-based measures were transformed to values on a scale of 0–100 based on the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of location-year values. We constructed the UHC effective coverage index by weighting each effective coverage indicator relative to its associated potential health gains, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years for each location-year and population-age group. For three tests of validity (content, known-groups, and convergent), UHC effective coverage index performance was generally better than that of other UHC service coverage indices from WHO (ie, the current metric for SDG indicator 3.8.1 on UHC service coverage), the World Bank, and GBD 2017. We quantified frontiers of UHC effective coverage performance on the basis of pooled health spending per capita, representing UHC effective coverage index levels achieved in 2019 relative to country-level government health spending, prepaid private expenditures, and development assistance for health. To assess current trajectories towards the GPW13 UHC billion target—1 billion more people benefiting from UHC by 2023—we estimated additional population equivalents with UHC effective coverage from 2018 to 2023. Findings: Globally, performance on the UHC effective coverage index improved from 45·8 (95% uncertainty interval 44·2–47·5) in 1990 to 60·3 (58·7–61·9) in 2019, yet country-level UHC effective coverage in 2019 still spanned from 95 or higher in Japan and Iceland to lower than 25 in Somalia and the Central African Republic. Since 2010, sub-Saharan Africa showed accelerated gains on the UHC effective coverage index (at an average increase of 2·6% [1·9–3·3] per year up to 2019); by contrast, most other GBD super-regions had slowed rates of progress in 2010–2019 relative to 1990–2010. Many countries showed lagging performance on effective coverage indicators for non-communicable diseases relative to those for communicable diseases and maternal and child health, despite non-communicable diseases accounting for a greater proportion of potential health gains in 2019, suggesting that many health systems are not keeping pace with the rising non-communicable disease burden and associated population health needs. In 2019, the UHC effective coverage index was associated with pooled health spending per capita (r=0·79), although countries across the development spectrum had much lower UHC effective coverage than is potentially achievable relative to their health spending. Under maximum efficiency of translating health spending into UHC effective coverage performance, countries would need to reach $1398 pooled health spending per capita (US$ adjusted for purchasing power parity) in order to achieve 80 on the UHC effective coverage index. From 2018 to 2023, an estimated 388·9 million (358·6–421·3) more population equivalents would have UHC effective coverage, falling well short of the GPW13 target of 1 billion more people benefiting from UHC during this time. Current projections point to an estimated 3·1 billion (3·0–3·2) population equivalents still lacking UHC effective coverage in 2023, with nearly a third (968·1 million [903·5–1040·3]) residing in south Asia. Interpretation: The present study demonstrates the utility of measuring effective coverage and its role in supporting improved health outcomes for all people—the ultimate goal of UHC and its achievement. Global ambitions to accelerate progress on UHC service coverage are increasingly unlikely unless concerted action on non-communicable diseases occurs and countries can better translate health spending into improved performance. Focusing on effective coverage and accounting for the world's evolving health needs lays the groundwork for better understanding how close—or how far—all populations are in benefiting from UHC.

Due to their toxicity, worldwide distribution, and lack of information in spermatozoa physiology during pre-fertilization processes, the present study seeks to analyze the toxic effects and possible alterations caused by the presence of these compounds in boar sperm during the in vitro capacitation. The spermatozoa capacitation was performed in supplemented TALP-Hepes media and mean lethal concentration values of 460.55 μM for PFOS, and 1930.60 μM for PFHxS were obtained. Results by chlortetracycline staining showed that intracellular Ca2+ patterns bound to membrane proteins were scarcely affected by PFOS. The spontaneous acrosome reaction determined by FITC-PNA was significantly reduced by PFOS and slightly increased by PFHxS. Both toxic compounds significantly alter the normal capacitation process from 30 min of exposure. An increase in ROS production was observed by flow cytometry and considerable DNA fragmentation by the comet assay. The immunocytochemistry showed a decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation in proteins of the equatorial and acrosomal zone of the spermatozoa head. In conclusion, PFOS and PFHxS have toxic effects on the sperm, causing mortality and altering vital parameters for proper sperm capacitation.;Boar spermatozoa | Perfluorinated compounds | PFHxS | PFOS | Spermatozoa toxicology;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;283833;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Methods: Cross-sectional study of 283 rural schoolchildren selected from two locations with high and medium levels of marginalization where the water fluoride concentration ranged from 2.0 to 2.5 ppm/F. Caries was evaluated using the DMFT index and dental fluorosis with the Thylstrup-Fejerskov Index (TFI). Socioeconomic data were collected from participants’ parents, with data on the children’s characteristics collected from them via a questionnaire. Results: The prevalence of caries was 72.4% (DMFT ≥1) in the permanent dentition. The prevalence of fluorosis was 98.0% (TFI ≥4=71.4%). 54.8% of the children brushed their teeth two or more times daily. In logistic regression children living in high levels of marginalization were more likely to present caries (OR=2.11, 95% CI 1.13 – 3.93) than children living in medium levels. Children with severe fluorosis (TFI ≥4) (OR=1.93, 95% CI 1.06 – 3.53) were more likely have caries than those with TFI <3. Conclusion: Rural children with a high level of marginalization and fluorosis (TFI ≥4) were more likely to present caries.

Although advances in medical care for HIV infection have dramatically reduced opportunistic infections and AIDS-defining cancers, some non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC) and specific oral diseases such as periodontitis and salivary gland disease are now more prevalent. Cancer prevention is, therefore, a priority issue in care of PLWH, stressing both restoration of immune function and reduction of non-HIV cancer risk factors (tobacco in all its forms; areca nut; heavy alcohol consumption; diets lacking antioxidant vitamins and minerals; and oncogenic virus infections) through specific interventions, especially tobacco and areca nut cessation and alcohol moderation. Detection of oral high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) and the universal preventive HPV vaccination among PLWH should be promoted to reduce the malignancy burden, along with routine oral examinations which remain the cheapest, most reliable, most reproducible, and non-invasive tool to identify suspicious lesions.

the Sustainable Development Goals as crucial for preventing disease and improving human wellbeing. Comprehensive, high-resolution estimates are important to inform progress towards achieving this goal. We aimed to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities. Methods: We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from 600 sources across more than 88 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to estimate access to drinking water and sanitation facilities on continuous continent-wide surfaces from 2000 to 2017, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. We estimated mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subcategories of facilities for drinking water (piped water on or off premises, other improved facilities, unimproved, and surface water) and sanitation facilities (septic or sewer sanitation, other improved, unimproved, and open defecation) with use of ordinal regression. We also estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths in children younger than 5 years attributed to unsafe facilities and estimated deaths that were averted by increased access to safe facilities in 2017, and analysed geographical inequality in access within LMICs. Findings: Across LMICs, access to both piped water and improved water overall increased between 2000 and 2017, with progress varying spatially. For piped water, the safest water facility type, access increased from 40·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 39·4–40·7) to 50·3% (50·0–50·5), but was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to piped water was mostly concentrated in urban centres. Access to both sewer or septic sanitation and improved sanitation overall also increased across all LMICs during the study period. For sewer or septic sanitation, access was 46·3% (95% UI 46·1–46·5) in 2017, compared with 28·7% (28·5–29·0) in 2000. Although some units improved access to the safest drinking water or sanitation facilities since 2000, a large absolute number of people continued to not have access in several units with high access to such facilities (>80%) in 2017. More than 253 000 people did not have access to sewer or septic sanitation facilities in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, despite 88·6% (95% UI 87·2–89·7) access overall. Many units were able to transition from the least safe facilities in 2000 to safe facilities by 2017; for units in which populations primarily practised open defecation in 2000, 686 (95% UI 664–711) of the 1830 (1797–1863) units transitioned to the use of improved sanitation. Geographical disparities in access to improved water across units decreased in 76·1% (95% UI 71·6–80·7) of countries from 2000 to 2017, and in 53·9% (50·6–59·6) of countries for access to improved sanitation, but remained evident subnationally in most countries in 2017. Interpretation: Our estimates, combined with geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden, identify where efforts to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities are most needed. By highlighting areas with successful approaches or in need of targeted interventions, our estimates can enable precision public health to effectively progress towards universal access to safe water and sanitation.

2020;The Lancet Global Health;;21100265444;2214109X;Journal;8;8;;e1038-e1060;"Background: Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is a form of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for diarrhoea that has the potential to drastically reduce child mortality; yet, according to UNICEF estimates, less than half of children younger than 5 years with diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) received ORS in 2016. A variety of recommended home fluids (RHF) exist as alternative forms of ORT; however, it is unclear whether RHF prevent child mortality. Previous studies have shown considerable variation between countries in ORS and RHF use, but subnational variation is unknown. This study aims to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of relative and absolute coverage of ORS, RHF, and ORT (use of either ORS or RHF) in LMICs. Methods: We used a Bayesian geostatistical model including 15 spatial covariates and data from 385 household surveys across 94 LMICs to estimate annual proportions of children younger than 5 years of age with diarrhoea who received ORS or RHF (or both) on continuous continent-wide surfaces in 2000–17, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. Additionally, we analysed geographical inequality in coverage across administrative units and estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths averted by increased coverage over the study period. Uncertainty in the mean coverage estimates was calculated by taking 250 draws from the posterior joint distribution of the model and creating uncertainty intervals (UIs) with the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of those 250 draws. Findings: While ORS use among children with diarrhoea increased in some countries from 2000 to 2017, coverage remained below 50% in the majority (62·6%; 12 417 of 19 823) of second administrative-level units and an estimated 6 519 000 children (95% UI 5 254 000–7 733 000) with diarrhoea were not treated with any form of ORT in 2017. Increases in ORS use corresponded with declines in RHF in many locations, resulting in relatively constant overall ORT coverage from 2000 to 2017. Although ORS was uniformly distributed subnationally in some countries, within-country geographical inequalities persisted in others; 11 countries had at least a 50% difference in one of their units compared with the country mean. Increases in ORS use over time were correlated with declines in RHF use and in diarrhoeal mortality in many locations, and an estimated 52 230 diarrhoeal deaths (36 910–68 860) were averted by scaling up of ORS coverage between 2000 and 2017. Finally, we identified key subnational areas in Colombia, Nigeria, and Sudan as examples of where diarrhoeal mortality remains higher than average, while ORS coverage remains lower than average. Interpretation: To our knowledge, this study is the first to produce and map subnational estimates of ORS, RHF, and ORT coverage and attributable child diarrhoeal deaths across LMICs from 2000 to 2017, allowing for tracking progress over time. Our novel results, combined with detailed subnational estimates of diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality, can support subnational needs assessments aimed at furthering policy makers' understanding of within-country disparities. Over 50 years after the discovery that led to this simple, cheap, and life-saving therapy, large gains in reducing mortality could still be made by reducing geographical inequalities in ORS coverage.

Different species of scorpions have divergent adaptations to the substrate they live in, but most of them share an intriguing characteristic: their exoskeleton contains fluorophores that emit blue-greenish fluorescence under ultraviolet radiation. Although there are some reports in the literature on the study of fluorescence in scorpions, the biological functionality of this light emission is currently unknown and is under debate. In this work, the properties of emission from the scorpion's exoskeleton are studied by means of digitally processed photographs taken of living specimens under ultraviolet illumination and complemented with standard spectroscopic measurements of emission and excitation spectra. With the aim of identifying possible correlations between the fluorescence, the characteristics color of the exoskeleton and the biology of the scorpions, 4 families, 9 genera and 24 species were studied. Our results suggest that the intensity of fluorescence is heterogeneous throughout the scorpion's exoskeleton studied here in such a way that pedipalps and metasomal segments fluoresce more intensely than the mesosomal segments. The spectrum of fluorescence across species is practically identical, suggesting that the same fluorophores are present in their exoskeletons. However, the fluorescence intensity emitted by each species varies according to their characteristic color (associated with the exoskeleton optical reflectance). Since the coloration of the exoskeleton is determined by the concentration of melanin and other pigments according to the substrate where scorpions live in, we conclude by suggesting that fluorescence may correlate directly to the ecomorphotype of the scorpions.;Exoskeleton | Fluorescence | Scorpions;4;0;;;NSF;DEB-1754587;National Science Foundation

ABCA1 variants have been shown to be associated to these conditions. We sought to test the combined effect of two ABCA1 gene common variants, rs2422493 (− 565C > T) and rs9282541 (R230C) on HDL-c levels and T2D risk. Methods: Path analysis was conducted in 3,303 Mexican-mestizos to assess the specific contributions of rs2422493 and rs9282541 ABCA1 variants, insulin resistance, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and age on HDL-c levels and T2D risk. Participants were classified into four groups according to their ABCA1 variants carrier status: (i) the reference group carried wild type alleles for both ABCA1 variants (−/−), (ii) +/– were carriers of rs2422493 but non-carriers of rs9282541, (iii) −/+ for carriers of rs9282541 but not carriers of rs2422493 and (iv) carriers of minor alleles for both SNPs (+/+). Principal components from two previous genome-wide association studies were used to control for ethnicity. Results: We identified significant indirect effects on T2D risk mediated by HDL-c in groups −/+ and +/+ (β = 0.04; p = 0.03 and β = 0.06; p < 0.01, respectively) in comparison to the −/− reference group. Low concentrations of HDL-c were directly and significantly associated with increased T2D risk (β = −0.70; p < 0.01). WHtR, male gender, age, and insulin resistance were also associated with T2D risk (p < 0.05). There was no significant direct effect for any of the ABCA1 groups on T2D risk: p = 0.99, p = 0.58, and p = 0.91 for groups +/–, −/+, and +/+ respectively. Conclusions: The ABCA1 rs9282541 (R230C) allele is associated with T2D in Mexicans through its effect on lowering HDL-c levels. This is the first report demonstrating that HDL-c levels act as an intermediate factor between an ABCA1 variant and T2D.";ABCA1 | HDL | HDL-c | Hypoalphalipoproteinemia | rs2422493 | rs9282541 | Type 2 diabetes;5;0;;;CONACYT;128877;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Recently, however, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) allows analyzing nonstationary signals in a nonlinear and time- variant way. Consequently, CEEMDAN may provide a means to obtain clues about ANS regulation in health and disease. In this study, we analyze the average Hilbert-Huang spectrum (HHS) of cardiovascular variability signals by CEEMDAN during a head-up tilt test (HUTT) in 12 healthy female subjects and 18 orthostatic intolerance female patients. Beat-to-beat intervals (BBI) as well as systolic (SYS) blood pressure variability time series were analyzed. In addition, instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies of specific intrinsic mode functions (IMF) were investigated separately to define the influence of the disease on ANS regulation. Female groups demonstrated statistical differences in the high-frequency band of BBI but higher differences for the high and low-frequency bands of SYS from the mechanical transition of HUTT.Clinical Relevance - A relevant outcome of the study is the average HHS of healthy female subjects along HUTT. This HHS may be used as reference to help diagnose OI when HHS of the cardiovascular variability signals of any subject deviates from the normal course.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

Six pigmented corn and barley beers were brewed and then analysed to obtain their sensory characteristics, volatile composition and non-volatile (alcohol, bitterness, anthocyanins and polyphenol content) composition. ANOVAs, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) were used to visualise these data for exploring the differences between beers based on the type of malt and to characterise corn beers considering the relationships between their sensory characteristics and their chemical parameters. The sensory attributes such as fermented fruits, cooked vegetables, tortillas, bread, dried fruits and dried chili characterised beers made 100% with pigmented corn. Over 100 volatiles were identified by head space-solid phase micro-extraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). Among them, phenols and terpenes were the groups of volatiles that better characterised beers containing corn. The content of anthocyanins in corn beers provide the 'amber-red-cooper' colours in beers and may prevent the development of off-aromas and tastes. The use of pigmented corn seems to be a good option to renew the traditional 'Sendechó' while preserving some of its sensory attributes.Â;Anthocyanins | Gc-ms | Hs-spme | SendechÃ | Sensory profile | Volatiles | Zea mays;14;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

attributable to diarrhoea. The substantial between-country variation in both diarrhoea incidence and mortality is attributable to interventions that protect children, prevent infection, and treat disease. Identifying subnational regions with the highest burden and mapping associated risk factors can aid in reducing preventable childhood diarrhoea. Methods We used Bayesian model-based geostatistics and a geolocated dataset comprising 15 072 746 children younger than 5 years from 466 surveys in 94 LMICs, in combination with findings of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, to estimate posterior distributions of diarrhoea prevalence, incidence, and mortality from 2000 to 2017. From these data, we estimated the burden of diarrhoea at varying subnational levels (termed units) by spatially aggregating draws, and we investigated the drivers of subnational patterns by creating aggregated risk factor estimates. Findings The greatest declines in diarrhoeal mortality were seen in south and southeast Asia and South America, where 54·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 38·1-65·8), 17·4% (7·7-28·4), and 59·5% (34·2-86·9) of units, respectively, recorded decreases in deaths from diarrhoea greater than 10%. Although children in much of Africa remain at high risk of death due to diarrhoea, regions with the most deaths were outside Africa, with the highest mortality units located in Pakistan. Indonesia showed the greatest within-country geographical inequality; some regions had mortality rates nearly four times the average country rate. Reductions in mortality were correlated to improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) or reductions in child growth failure (CGF). Similarly, most high-risk areas had poor WASH, high CGF, or low oral rehydration therapy coverage. Interpretation By co-analysing geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden and its key risk factors, we could assess candidate drivers of subnational death reduction. Further, by doing a counterfactual analysis of the remaining disease burden using key risk factors, we identified potential intervention strategies for vulnerable populations. In view of the demands for limited resources in LMICs, accurately quantifying the burden of diarrhoea and its drivers is important for precision public health.";;42;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0084;National Institutes of Health

This study aimed to evaluate the physiological status of rooster sperm when preserved in vitro with uterus vaginal junction secretions (UVJS). Males and females of the Rhode Island breed were used. Sperm aliquots were prepared using Lake extender and Lake extender with UVJS (10.00%, 30.00%, 60.00%, and 90.00%). Subsequently, a basic sperm evaluation was performed and sperm physiological status was determined through the presence and distribution of Ca2+ and its acrosomal reaction capability via perivitelline layer (PVL) co-incubation. It was observed that motility was decreased in sperm preserved with UVJS at 6 and 24 hr) compared to 40 min and fresh semen. The sperm decapacitation percentage was increased when preserved with UVJS at 40 min, 6 and 24 hr compared to fresh semen. The acrosomal reaction was increased in sperm co-incubated with PVL, even when preserved with UVJS. It was concluded that UVJS induced physiological changes in sperm by inducing a decapacitation process, which increased sperm viability when preserved in vitro.;Acrosome | Decapacitation | Hen | Oviduct | Semen;2;0;;;CONACYT;793369;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Many of them play an important role in the maintenance of this parasite. In particular, new studies have appeared which indicate that some species of Procyonidae family may play a role as T. cruzi hosts, however, more data are needed to evaluate their long-term physiological response to parasite infection, especially for specific antibodies. In this study, antibodies to T. cruzi were detected and prevalence and epitope recognition were assessed by ELISA (using discrete typing unit (DTU) I as antigen) and WB (using DTU I and DTU II as antigens) and sera from two procyonid species obtained through five-year follow-up of two semicaptive populations living in the same habitat. Marked heterogeneity in antigens recognition between species and differences in seroprevalence (p = 0.0002) between white-nosed coatis (Nasua narica), 51.8% (115/222), and common raccoons (Procyon lotor), 28.3% (23/81), were found. Antigens with high molecular weight when DTU-I was used were the most recognized, while a greater antigen diversity recognition was observed with DTU-II; for white-nosed coatis, low-molecular-weight antigens were mainly recognized, while for common raccoons proteins with molecular weights greater than 80 kDa were recognized most. These divergent humoral immune responses could be related to an alleged pattern of recognition receptors and major histocompatibility complex molecules difference in the procyonids species.";Antibodies | ELISA and western blot | Epitope recognition | Nasua narica | Procyon lotor | Procyonidae | Trypanosoma cruzi;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Resonant band structures of transmission coefficients are obtained as functions of the incidence angle, the geometric parameters, and the number of unit cells of the superlattices. The theory of finite periodic systems that we use is free of assumptions, the finiteness of the periodic system being an essential condition. We rederive the correct recurrence relation of the Chebyshev polynomials that carry the physical information of the coherent coupling of plasmon modes and interface plasmons and surface plasmons, responsible for the photonic bands and the resonant structure of the surface plasmon polaritons. Unlike the dispersion relations of infinite periodic systems, which at best predict the bandwidths, we show that the dispersion relation of this theory predicts not only the bands, but also the resonant plasmons' frequencies, above and below the plasma frequency. We show that, besides the strong influence of the incidence angle and the characteristic low transmission of a single conductor slab for frequencies ω below the plasma frequency ωp, the coherent coupling of the bulk plasmon modes and the interface surface plasmon polaritons lead to oscillating transmission coefficients and, depending on the parity of the number of unit cells n of the superlattice, the transmission coefficient vanishes or amplifies as the conductor width increases. Similarly, the well-established transmission coefficient of a single left-handed slab, which exhibits optical antimatter effects, becomes highly resonant with superluminal effects in superlattices. We determine the space-time evolution of a wave packet through the λ/4 photonic superlattice whose bandwidth becomes negligible, and the transmission coefficient becomes a sequence of isolated and equidistant peaks with negative phase times. We show that the space-time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, with the centroid at any of these peaks, agrees with the theoretical predictions, and no violation of the causality principle occurs.;Left-handed superlattices | Negative tunneling times | Parity effects in metallic superlattices | Photonics | Planar metallic superlattices | Plasmonic frequencies | Resonant dispersion relations;3;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

This study characterized access and adherence to PAP in patients with moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in Latin America. Methods: Cross-sectional study, conducted at 9 sleep centers across Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Adults diagnosed with moderate-severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 15/h) in the previous 12–18 months were eligible. Anthropometrics, health coverage, and OSA severity data were collected. Data on access to therapy, barriers to access, adherence, and factors related to non-compliance were obtained via standardized telephone survey. Results: Eight hundred eighty patients (70% male, 54 ± 13 years, AHI 49 ± 28/h, body mass index 32 ± 7 kg/m2) were included. Four hundred ninety patients (56%) initiated PAP, 70 (14%) discontinued therapy during the first year (mainly due to intolerance), and 420 (48%) were still using PAP when surveyed. Health insurance was private in 36.9% of patients, via the social security system in 31.1%, and via the state in 13.3%, and 18.7% did not have any coverage; 49.5% of patients had to pay all equipment costs. Reasons for not starting PAP were unclear or absent indication (42%), coverage problems (36%), and lack of awareness of OSA burden (14%). Patients with better adherence were older (55.3 ± 13 vs 52 ± 13; p = 0.002) and had more severe OSA (AHI 51.8 ± 27 vs 45.6 ± 27; p = 0.001). Conclusions: Less than half moderate-severe OSA patients started and continue to use PAP. Unclear or absent medical indication and financial limitations were the most relevant factors limiting access to therapy.";Compliance to treatment | Continuous positive airway pressure | Latin America | Obstructive sleep apnea;4;0;;;WRAIR;undefined;Walter Reed Army Institute of Research

Microscopic features of both cases revealed solid areas of malignant odontogenic tumor with a large amount of dentinoid material. We identified pathogenic mutations in the genes CTNNB1 and APC, both of which are part of the Wnt-signaling pathway. Consistent with Wnt-signaling activation, both tumors showed strong β-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei.

Aim: To integrate the available data published on POT into a comprehensive analysis to better define its clinicopathological and molecular features. Material and Methods: An electronic systematic review was performed up to September 2019 in multiple databases. Results: A total of 13 publications were included, representing 16 reported cases and 3 molecular studies. The mean age of the affected patients was 11.6 years (range 2-19), with a slight predominance in males (56.25%). The posterior mandible was the main location (87.5%), with only two cases affecting the posterior maxilla. All cases appeared as a radiolucent lesion in close relationship to an unerupted tooth. Recurrences have not been reported to date. Microscopically, POT comprises fibromyxoid tissue with variable cellularity surrounded by a cuboidal to columnar odontogenic epithelium but without unequivocal dental hard tissue formation. A delicate fibrous capsule surrounds (at least partially) the tumor. The epithelial component shows immunohistochemical positivity for amelogenin, CK19, and CK14, and variable expression of Glut-1, Galectin-3 and Caveolin-1, Vimentin, p-53, PITX2, Bcl-2, Bax and Survivin; the mesenchymal tissue is positive for Vimentin, CD90, p-53, PITX2, Bcl-2, Bax, and Survivin, and the subepithelial region exhibits the strong expression of Syndecan-1 and CD34. The Ki-67 index is low (<5%). The negative or weak expression of dentinogenesis-associated genes could explain the inhibition of dentin and subsequent enamel formation in this neoplasm. Conclusion: POT is an entity with a well-defined clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular profile that must be properly diagnosed and differentiated from other odontogenic lesions and treated consequently.";Primordial odontogenic tumor | Systematic review;10;1;repositoryvor;Green;UdelaR;undefined;Universidad de la República Uruguay

Methods: Twenty-one young female patients (28 ± 7 years) with orthostatic intolerance (OI) and 13 age-matched female controls (26 ± 5 years) were investigated during a 70° HUTT. Analyses were performed on bivariate time series including beat-to-beat intervals (BBI), respiratory amplitude (RESP) at BBI onset as well as systolic (SYS) and diastolic (DIA) blood pressure at simultaneous and shifted beats. DPA was used to characterize cardiovascular interactions as SYS→BBI and BBI→DIA, as well as cardiorespiratory interactions as RESP→BBI and RESP→DIA. Results: Occurrence of simultaneous BBI increases due to SYS increases (bradycardic baroreflex) was significantly reduced during orthostatic phase in patients (28.54 ± 6.32% versus 36.35 ± 4.77%, p < 0.01). Considering the magnitude of consecutive changes, patients revealed an increased amount of points characterized by low heart rate variability combined with high blood pressure variability for SYS→BBI at tau = 0, BBI→SYS at tau = 2 and BBI→DIA at tau = 1. Interaction analysis for SYS→BBI showed highly significant differences already in supine position (10.08±5.90% versus 4.78±2.42%, p < 0.01), during tilt-up (12.32±5.00% versus 5.51±3.07%, p < 0.0001) and during early orthostatic phase (14.55±6.00% versus 5.71±3.14%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Temporal dynamic analysis by DPA revealed impaired autonomic control in patients compared to healthy subjects during supine position, transition and orthostatic phase. Significance: DPA is a promising graphical tool to demonstrate impaired autonomic regulation.;Cardiorespiratory interactions | Cardiovascular interactions | Delta plot analysis | Nonlinear dynamics | Orthostatic intolerance;0;0;;;;undefined;

In this context, we report an unusual malignant odontogenic tumor containing dentinoid located in the left maxilla of a 41-year-old man. The lesion was initially diagnosed and treated as a cemento-ossifying fibroma. After 7 years, a tumor was noted at the same location and was diagnosed as pleomorphic adenoma. The patient developed a new lesion 2 years later. Histological features included an epithelial proliferation of basaloid and clear cells, some with peripheral palisading, which were scattered both in a fibrous stroma and within an amorphous eosinophilic dentinoid product. Because of doubts about the first 2 diagnoses and the current situation, all histopathological slides were reviewed in our service as a consultation case, and the findings were consistent with the diagnosis of an odontogenic carcinoma with dentinoid. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed and an ultrastructural study by scanning electronic microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis was made to characterize dentinoid material. After 1 year of follow-up, the patient is alive and free of the disease. This case highlights the wide variability regarding cytological evidence of malignancy, and adds a new case of odontogenic carcinoma with dentinoid, which represents a distinct entity with locally aggressive behavior and should be considered be included in a future World Health Organization Histological Classification of Tumours.";carcinoma | dentinoid | maxilla | odontogenic tumors;2;0;;;FAPESP;2016/07399-4;Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo

Due to the complex nature of the factors involved in the process of parturition, it may be difficult to distinguish between eutocia (normal delivery) and dystocia (difficult birth). It is essential to do so because the physiopathological effects of problematic labour often deteriorate the dam's fertility and, in severe cases, may cause her death as a result of damage to the genital apparatus and the secondary development of systemic infections. Also, if parturition is not successful, neonates could suffer prolonged episodes of hypoxia, which represents a leading cause of foetal death in cases of dystocia and, even when not fatal, can be a determining factor in neonatal survival. Given this, a better knowledge of the aetiology and physiopathology of dystocia will be keys to understanding this condition and adequate decision making in obstetrical practice and veterinary perinatology. Moreover, such knowledge will permit the timely identification of cases that require special attention and establishing actions to protect animal welfare and assess risks that, on occasion, will entail pharmacological control of eutocia or dystocia. Hence, this paper aims to review some of the most critical aspects involved in the process of difficult deliveries and their consequences for the dam and the foetuses of domestic animals.;Asphyxia | Dam welfare | Domestic animals | Dystocia | Foetus | Hypoxia | Pain;10;0;;;;undefined;

Methods: The As content was quantifed in the water supply sources for human use and its intake was estimated in Mezquital population, southern Durango. With the data obtained, the hazard quotient (HQ) was calculated to determine the non-carcinogenic risk to develop chronic systemic effects in underweight children. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reference health values estimating As exposure risk are from 0.0003 mg/kg/day (non-carcinogenic) to 1.5 mg/kg/day (carcinogenic risk). Results: The analyzed waters presented as concentrations that varied from 0.3 to 10.2 µg/L, with a mean of 7.35 µg/L (CI 95% 6.27–8.38). The exposure dose was 0.4 to 1.36, and the HQ was 1.90 to 6.48 mg/kg/day, the estimated carcinogenic risk from adults varied from 1.28 to 4.37E−4, with values of 3.74–4.37E−4 mg/kg/day in central area. Conclusions: The children are at risk to develop chronic systemic effects due to ingestion of As from water.;Arsenic | Carcinogenic risk | Exposure dose | Hazard quotient | Non-carcinogenic;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;3450496;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

There are differences in the susceptibility to and severity of DF in studied populations. The objective of the present study was to determine if single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the genes Amelogenin (AMELX), Odontogenic Ameloblast Associated (ODAM) and Matrix Metalloproteinase 20 (MMP20) are associated with DF by evaluating the relationship between variations in these genes and the degree of DF severity. Subjects and methods: Schoolchildren from two regions of Durango State and Mexico City, Mexico, were studied. The DF phenotype was determined using the Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) index. DNA was obtained from the buccal mucosa of each participant, and the presence of the variations rs946252 in AMELX, rs1514392 in ODAM and rs1784418 in MMP20 was determined by bidirectional DNA sequencing. Results: A total of 180 DNA samples from 30 schoolchildren from 2 areas of Durango State were sequenced and analyzed. Differences in the severity of DF were found between the study areas (p = 0.006). SNVs in theMMP20 gene were present in 76.9 % of the participants in the high fluoride concentration and lower DF severity area. Conclusion: AMELX and ODAM variations was not different between the two populations with respect to DF severity; however, the presence of rs1784418 differed between phenotypes with regard to susceptibility to DF. Therefore, MMP20 might be related to the various phenotypes of DF and may serve as a protective marker.";Enamel development | Fluor | Genetics | Schoolchildren | SNV | TF index;5;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The purpose of this study was to understand the mechanisms underlying tooth movement acceleration by measuring alterations in a panel of intercellular signalling molecules and markers of osteoblast/osteoclast function following micro-pulse vibration for 20 min at 30 Hz. Design: Primary BALB/c mouse calvarial osteoblasts were cultivatedin vitro and subjected to micro-pulse vibration (0.25 N; 30 Hz) with the AcceleDent® Aura appliance for 20 min and assayed for IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, OPG, soluble RANKL and TGF-β protein by ELISA; for PCNA in osteoblasts and caspase 3/7 in osteoclasts by immunohistochemistry; for IL-4, IL-13, and Il-17 in osteoclasts by ELISA; and for cathepsin K by flow cytometry. Results: After micro-pulse vibration, the murine osteoblast culture supernatant showed increased IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, OPG and TGF-β levels and decreased RANKL levels; PCNA in osteoblasts and caspase 3/7 in osteoclasts were also upregulated. The osteoclast culture supernatant had increased levels of IL-4, IL-13 and IL-17, and cathepsin K was upregulated in the treatment group compared with the control group. Conclusions: Micro-pulse vibration promotes the production of soluble factors that inhibit osteoclasts, promote apoptosis and activate osteoblasts in vitro, which could increase bone mineral density. Further studies should be conducted in order to understand the biological mechanism of how micro-vibration might influence tooth movement during orthodontic treatment.";Acceledent aura | Bone marrow derivate osteoclasts | Micro pulse vibration | Mouse osteoblasts | Pleiotropic cytokine;5;0;;;UAM;undefined;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

Here we expand on the available precision SDG evidence by estimating the subnational distribution of educational attainment, including the proportions of individuals who have completed key levels of schooling, across all low- and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2017. Previous analyses have focused on geographical disparities in average attainment across Africa or for specific countries, but—to our knowledge—no analysis has examined the subnational proportions of individuals who completed specific levels of education across all low- and middle-income countries12–14.

Material and methods: The study was descriptive, cross-sectional, explanatory and observational. Subjects considered eligible were born in 1999 and had their parents’ or guardian’s prior consent. A questionnaire was used to identify SES according to Centro de Investigaciones Económicas Institute on four levels. Dental fluorosis was determined using the Thylstrup–Fejerskov (TF) index. Results: Of the 1544 students examined, 45.0% showed dental fluorosis. A TF index 1–2 was recorded in 29.3% of the subjects, TF 3 in 20.9%, TF 4 in 6.7% and TF 5–9 in 2.1%. In area 1 (the capital Montevideo city), 84.8% of the subjects had dental fluorosis, a value that was significantly higher than in the inland region (area 2, 24.4%) and border departments (area 3, 22.5%) (x2 = 27.92, p <.0001). Students from families with a low socio-economic level showed less prevalence of dental fluorosis than those with a high level (x2 = 14.58, p =.002). Conclusion: Significant differences exist in the prevalence of dental fluorosis in relation to place of residence and socio-economic level.;12-year-old students | Dental fluorosis | socio-economic status;2;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

Previous studies have reported the relationship between the use of nutritional supplements with gym attendees' sociodemographic characteristics, experience, and training goals, but not with indicators of body image selfperception. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 1,135 Mexican adults aged 18 to 40 years. Exercise, nutritional, and supplementation habits were investigated. Using Poisson regression models, the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, exercise, and self-perceived body image with the use of NS was analyzed. Results: 58.0% of the participants were men, 46.2% had consumed a NS and 35.4% currently used them. The most consumed NS were sports drinks (28.7%) and protein (23.6%). Supplement consumption was higher in men, in older participants, in those who have trained during more time, and those with functional impairment caused by training habits. Nutritionists were the third source to recommend NS, after coaches and friends. Conclusions: Almost half of the gym attendees have consumed some NS. There are groups that are more likely to consume NS, which may require further investigation regarding the reasons that explain this situation.;Athletic Performance | Body Dissatisfaction | Body Image | Dietary Supplements | Exercise, Mexico;2;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

For this reason, it is important to verify the condition of animals throughout the supply chain in order to ensure their welfare and obtain, at the end of the slaughtering process, high-quality carcases and meat. Several studies have identified the indicators and samples that need to be taken into account to properly measure and evaluate the responses that these animals emit to the stressors involved. However, these procedures must be carried out quickly and by non-invasive means so as not to impede the flow of animals through the operations of loading, transport, unloading and lairage. Therefore, the objective of this review article is to analyse the stressful events that pigs experience during these events and discuss the use of the infrared thermography (IRT) as an alternative tool for measuring stress based on temperature changes on the surface of pigs’ skin. We argue that infrared thermography can be used as a strategy to improve animal welfare during loading, transport, unloading and lairage by preventing fatigue and deaths, and decreasing negative impacts on meat quality, such as pale, soft and exudative (PSE), or dark, firm and dry (DFD) conditions.;abattoir | infrared thermography | Pig welfare | skin temperature | transport;6;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Milk samples were obtained from both glands for 21 consecutive days post infection. Total RNA was extracted, and real-time PCR was conducted using primers specific to each cytokine. The relative RNA expression of the evaluated cytokines was determined by the comparative method 2-ΔΔCT, using milk from the right gland of the goats as a reference (control) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an endogenous control. According to the Wilcoxon test results, IL-1B and IL-12 expression levels showed significant differences compared to those in the control group (p<0.05) from 24 hours post infection until the end of lactation; on day three, IL1β, IL8, IL12 and TGF-β had a statistically significant change in expression with respect to those in the control group (p<0.05); closer to the end of the lactation period, there is no overexpression of the anti-inflammatory interleukins (IL-4 and TGF-β) which may reflect the effort of the host immune system to eradicate the microorganism from the mammary gland.";Goats | Interleukins | Mastitis | QRT-PCR | Staphylococcus chromogenes;0;0;;;UAM;undefined;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

By using the nuclei coordinates of islet cells obtained through DAPI staining, cell types identified by immunostaining, and cell size distributions estimated from capacitance measurements, reconstructed islets composed of non-overlapping spherical cells were obtained through an iterative optimization procedure. In all cases, the reconstructed architectures included >99% of the experimental identified cells, each of them having a radius within the experimentally reported ranges. Given the wide use of mathematical modeling for the study of pancreatic cells, and recently, of cell-cell interactions within the pancreatic islets, the methodology here proposed, also capable of identifying cell-to-cell contacts, is aimed to provide with a framework for modeling and analyzing experimentally-based pancreatic islet architectures.;architecture | islets | modeling | optimization | pancreatic cells;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;829;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Prevention;13538047;15054;14755785;Journal;26;1;;I125-I153;Background: While there is a long history of measuring death and disability from injuries, modern research methods must account for the wide spectrum of disability that can occur in an injury, and must provide estimates with sufficient demographic, geographical and temporal detail to be useful for policy makers. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study used methods to provide highly detailed estimates of global injury burden that meet these criteria. Methods: In this study, we report and discuss the methods used in GBD 2017 for injury morbidity and mortality burden estimation. In summary, these methods included estimating cause-specific mortality for every cause of injury, and then estimating incidence for every cause of injury. Non-fatal disability for each cause is then calculated based on the probabilities of suffering from different types of bodily injury experienced. Results: GBD 2017 produced morbidity and mortality estimates for 38 causes of injury. Estimates were produced in terms of incidence, prevalence, years lived with disability, cause-specific mortality, years of life lost and disability-adjusted life-years for a 28-year period for 22 age groups, 195 countries and both sexes. Conclusions: GBD 2017 demonstrated a complex and sophisticated series of analytical steps using the largest known database of morbidity and mortality data on injuries. GBD 2017 results should be used to help inform injury prevention policy making and resource allocation. We also identify important avenues for improving injury burden estimation in the future.;;29;1;repositoryam;Green;FedUni;201900;Federation University Australia

Prevention;13538047;15054;14755785;Journal;26;1;;I96-I114;Background Past research in population health trends has shown that injuries form a substantial burden of population health loss. Regular updates to injury burden assessments are critical. We report Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 Study estimates on morbidity and mortality for all injuries. methods We reviewed results for injuries from the GBD 2017 study. GBD 2017 measured injury-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) using the Cause of Death Ensemble model. To measure non-fatal injuries, GBD 2017 modelled injury-specific incidence and converted this to prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs). YLLs and YLDs were summed to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Findings In 1990, there were 4 260 493 (4 085 700 to 4 396 138) injury deaths, which increased to 4 484 722 (4 332 010 to 4 585 554) deaths in 2017, while age-standardised mortality decreased from 1079 (1073 to 1086) to 738 (730 to 745) per 100 000. In 1990, there were 354 064 302 (95% uncertainty interval: 338 174 876 to 371 610 802) new cases of injury globally, which increased to 520 710 288 (493 430 247 to 547 988 635) new cases in 2017. During this time, age-standardised incidence decreased non-significantly from 6824 (6534 to 7147) to 6763 (6412 to 7118) per 100 000. Between 1990 and 2017, age-standardised DALYs decreased from 4947 (4655 to 5233) per 100 000 to 3267 (3058 to 3505). Interpretation Injuries are an important cause of health loss globally, though mortality has declined between 1990 and 2017. Future research in injury burden should focus on prevention in high-burden populations, improving data collection and ensuring access to medical care.;;68;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;315CIBERSAM;National Institutes of Health

Blood samples were collected from the brachial vein of each raptor under physical restraint. Significant differences between the two locations were found in some parameters including total, erythrocytes, heterophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio. When the results were compared to the reference values, the population of Amecameca showed decreased values of hematocrit (32.21 ± 13.72%), hemoglobin (107.40 ± 45.60 g L-1) and erythrocytes (1.98 ± 0.63 ×1012 per µL). This work contributed to the knowledge of variations in blood parameters of clinically healthy captive Harris`s hawks at different tropical locations and sex. The information will enable clinicians to provide appropriate veterinary diagnostics and care to ensure the health and welfare of raptors kept in captivity.;Avian | Blood cell | Falconiforms;0;0;;;;undefined;

One of them is to have sufficient health workers, well distributed and with the skills and motivation needed for the transformation of health services and to provide comprehensive and quality responses to people and their communities. This article presents the results of a dialogue between academics from universities in the Americas, and reflects on four essential dimensions: planning, interprofessional training, social responsibility of academic centers, and the use of models of teaching-service-research. These dimensions are fundamental for a comprehensive training of health professionals that contributes to universal health coverage.;Americas | Health workforce | Interprofessional education | Social responsibility | Staff development | Universal health coverage | Universities;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Methods: We used GBD 2017 for burden of unintentional injury estimates, including transport injuries, for Mexico and each state in Mexico from 1990 to 2017. We examined subnational variation, age patterns, sex differences and time trends for all injury burden metrics. Results: Unintentional injury deaths in Mexico decreased from 45 363 deaths (44 662 to 46 038) in 1990 to 42 702 (41 439 to 43 745) in 2017, while age-standardised mortality rates decreased from 65.2 (64.4 to 66.1) in 1990 to 35.1 (34.1 to 36.0) per 100 000 in 2017. In terms of non-fatal outcomes, there were 3 120 211 (2 879 993 to 3 377 945) new injury cases in 1990, which increased to 5 234 214 (4 812 615 to 5 701 669) new cases of injury in 2017. We estimated 2 761 957 (2 676 267 to 2 859 777) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to injuries in Mexico in 1990 compared with 2 376 952 (2 224 588 to 2 551 004) DALYs in 2017. We found subnational variation in health loss across Mexico's states, including concentrated burden in Tabasco, Chihuahua and Zacatecas. Conclusions: In Mexico, from 1990 to 2017, mortality due to unintentional injuries has decreased, while non-fatal incident cases have increased. However, unintentional injuries continue to cause considerable mortality and morbidity, with patterns that vary by state, age, sex and year. Future research should focus on targeted interventions to decrease injury burden in high-risk populations.;burden of disease | descriptive epidemiology | epidemiology | global;11;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

OBJECTIVES: In this study we searched for breast cancer-associated auto-antibodies against individual TAAs. Also we evaluated if a panel of multiple TTAs would improve the detection of auto-antibodies. We screened CEA, CCBN1, c-Myc, p53, Ki-67, Nm23, PRDX6, eIF5A, PARK7, GLIO-1, Hsp27 and Hsp70 proteins, previously detected as up-regulated in breast tumors of Mexican patients. METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed to detect auto-antibodies in sera from a cohort of 104 breast cancer patients and 50 sera from healthy individuals. RESULTS: Our data showed that antibodies frequency to any individual TAA was low and ranged from 0.96% to 4.8%. However, the successive addition of multiple TAAs represented by panels of three-to-five TAAs resulted in increased ELISA positive reactions. The first panel of three combined TAAs (p53/PRDX6/CEA) had a sensitivity of 19%, while a second set of four TAAs (p53/PRDX6/c-Myc/Hsp70) reached 28% sensitivity. Likewise, a third panel of five antigens (p53/PRDX6/c-Myc/Hsp70/Nm23) showed 34% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that detection of individual autoantibodies against TAAs in the cohort of patients analyzed here was low, which was enhanced by adding multiple TAAs. Data support the notion that frequencies of autoantibodies could be impacted by geographical and heterogeneous genetic factors of breast cancer patients.;autoantibodies | Breast cancer | immunodiagnosis | tumor-associated antigens;7;0;;;CONACYT;341800;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Over 100 associated loci have been identified but few reports have evaluated the population attributable fraction captured by them in population-based nationwide surveys. Therefore, we determined the population contribution of a set of known genetic risk variants to the development of dyslipidemias and T2D in Mexico. This study included 1665 participants from a Mexican National Health Survey carried out in the year 2000. It is a probabilistic complex sample survey of households, which comprises representative data at a national level. 103 previously reported SNPs associated with different dyslipidemias or T2D were genotyped and used to compute polygenic risk scores. We found that the previously known variants associated with dyslipidemias explain at most 7% of the total risk variance of lipid levels. In contrast, the known genetic risk component for T2D explained a negligible amount of variance (0.1%). Notably, variants derived from the Native-American ancestry have the strongest effect and contribute with a high proportion of the variance. These results support the need for additional studies aimed to identify specific genetic risk variants for Mexican population.;Cholesterol | Dyslipidemias | Genetics | HDL | LDL | Mexicans | Polygenic risk score | Triglycerides | Type 2 diabetes;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;128877;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Forty Murrah calves (20 males, 20 females) between 7–8 months of age (229.05 ± 54 kg) were assigned to one of four groups with ten animals each: NW: non-weaned, AW: abruptly weaned on day 0, NFW: calves fitted with nose-flaps on day −7. At day 0 devices were removed and calves were separated permanently from their mothers, FENW: calves separated from their mothers by a fence-line on day -7. At day 0 calves were separated permanently from their mothers. All physiological indicators; heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), skin surface temperature (SST), rectal temperature (RT), gas exchange, acid-base balance, hydric and mineral balance and energy metabolism were recorded at days −7, −6, −4, 0, 1 and 3. Results show that calves in FENW had higher HR, RR, RT and glucose values (P<0.05) between days −7 and −6 than the other groups, while the AW calves had higher HR, RR, RT, glucose and lactate values between days 0 and 1 (P<0.05). No changes were found for the effect of group in relation to blood gases, acid-base balance, or hydric and mineral balance (P>0.05). Study results demonstrate that abrupt weaning by a fence-line in the early post-separation stage generates changes in physiological and energy metabolism possibly associated with the moment of separation from their mothers. The changes found for effect of weaning strategies in the parameters measured could provide a reference for weaned buffalo calves on their physiology.";Metabolism | Physiology | Stress | Water buffalo calves | Weaning;3;0;;;CONACYT;515743;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Continental ancestries are the major determinants of frequencies of the increased-activity allele CYP2C19*17 and CYP2C19 gUMs (negatively associated with Native American ancestry), decreased-activity alleles CYP2D6*41 and CYP2C9*2 (positively associated with European ancestry), and decreased-activity alleles CYP2D6*17 and CYP2D6*29 (positively associated with African ancestry). For the rare alleles, CYP2C9*2 and CYPC19*17, European admixture accounts for their presence in Native American populations, but rare alleles CYP2D6*5 (null-activity), CYP2D6-multiplication alleles (increased activity), and CYP2C9*3 (decreased-activity) were present in the pre-Columbian Americas. The study of a broad spectrum of Native American populations from different ethno-linguistic groups show how autochthonous diversity shaped the distribution of pharmaco-alleles and give insights on the prevalence of clinically relevant phenotypes associated with drugs, such as paroxetine, tamoxifen, warfarin, and clopidogrel.;;17;0;repositoryvor;Green;NIH;18IA003;National Institutes of Health

depression. In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (FROH) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that FROH is significantly associated (p < 0.0005) with apparently deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: FROH equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44–66%] in the odds of having children. Finally, the effects of FROH are confirmed within full-sibling pairs, where the variation in FROH is independent of all environmental confounding.;;33;1;repositoryam;Green;NIA;R01AG015819;National Institute on Aging

There are several monitoring techniques to evaluate the process of lowering the pH in the concrete, named carbonation depth progress. In this research, an electrochemical AC impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique has been used as an effective laboratory tool for monitoring the evolution of the carbonation progress. A comparison with the traditional phenolphthalein colorimetric technique was also discussed here. Particularly, monitoring is achieved by measuring the change in electrical resistance (Rpo) and capacitance (Cpo) of the concrete bulk, which is obtained from the semicircle at high-frequency region of a typical EIS diagram. According to the EIS results, carbonation progress was observed by a significant increase in the diameter of the semicircle, thus demonstrating the increase in resistivity of ions transmission due to blockade of pores by precipitation of CaCO3 compounds. Furthermore, it was possible to predict the specific time at which the carbonation front reaches the steel-rebar interface at low frequency region and possibly starting a considerable corrosion attack. Finally, the results suggested that EIS technique could be considered a practical tool for evaluating the carbonation progress of reinforced concrete structures without causing structural damage, in addition to the sensitivity of this technique with sufficient accuracy to predict the activation of the reinforcing steel.;Carbonation | Concrete | Corrosion | Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy | Phenolphthalein test | Steel reinforcing;3;0;;;UAM;UAEM-CA-202;Universidad AutÃ³noma Metropolitana

Grain boundaries, however, can provide preferential sites for chemical reactions, adsorption processes, nucleation of phase transitions, and mechanical transformations. In this work, “soft heteroepitaxy” is used to exert precise control over the lattice orientation of three-dimensional liquid crystalline soft crystals, thereby granting the ability to sculpt the grain boundaries between them. Since these soft crystals are liquid-like in nature, the heteroepitaxy approach introduced here provides a clear strategy to accurately mold liquid-liquid interfaces in structured liquids with a hitherto unavailable level of precision.;;15;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Large companies and research institutes generate software architectures for very specific uses. However, these can be hardly adopted for other purposes and uses. Therefore, there is a lack of generic architectures that can be easily used in any type of problem and these can be sufficiently flexible to be implemented in different contexts, mainly in the context of systems with databases with scientific information. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a generic architecture that allows semantic and visual queries from a web interface. This architecture is easily scalable, because it is divided into separate layers that can be interchangeable and each layer has specific purposes. This generic software architecture is composed of three important features: Semantic, Rich Interaction and Control. Therefore, the system implemented with this architecture can be easily adaptable to different contexts and it can be evolved and scalable over time. In this paper, we describe in detail all the layers involved and their purpose. So this architecture can be implemented in all types of systems that need a visual interaction of their information. The contribution of this generic architecture is that it can be adapted to provide new types of interaction with different types of scientific information.;Component | Computer Applications | Scientific databases | Software architecture | Software Engineering | Software Systems and Applications;1;0;;;;undefined;

To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2—to end preventable child deaths by 2030—we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000–2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations.;;95;1;repositoryam;Green;FIC;K43TW010716;Fogarty International Center

These microorganisms also interact in the human body. Fungal-bacteria interactions are present in many diseases. In this study, we evaluated the microbial interaction of Fusarium falciforme and Staphylococcus aureus developing mixed biofilm in vitro. When both microorganisms grew up together the mixed biofilm biomass decreased than F. falciforme monobiofilm biomass. S. aureus was able to interact and form aggregates over the mycelium and conidia surface of F. falciforme. Our results suggest that S. aureus could bind to colloidal chitin. On another hand, the supernatants from S. aureus biofilm and S. aureus-F. falciforme presented an antifungal effect over F. falciforme biofilm formation. Finally we found that the pH had an inhibitory effect over fungal biofilm formation. We concluded that S. aureus can affect the F. falciforme growth negatively in mixed biofilm involving factors like pH, supernatants compounds, anchor to chitin, and bacterial viability.;Chitin | Fungal-bacterial interactions | Matrix | Mixed biofilms;4;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The neuroanatomical characterization of subjects with this disorder is crucial for the better understanding of its pathophysiology; also, evaluation of these features as classifiers between patients and controls is relevant to determine potential biomarkers and useful in clinical diagnosis. This was the first multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) study on an early-onset OCD subtype.Methods Fourteen pediatric patients with PANDAS were paired with 14 healthy subjects and were scanned to obtain structural magnetic resonance images (MRI). We identified neuroanatomical differences between subjects with PANDAS and healthy controls using voxel-based morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and surface analysis. We investigated the usefulness of these neuroanatomical differences to classify patients with PANDAS using MVPA.Results The pattern for the gray and white matter was significantly different between subjects with PANDAS and controls. Alterations emerged in the cortex, subcortex, and cerebellum. There were no significant group differences in DTI measures (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity) or cortical features (thickness, sulci, volume, curvature, and gyrification). The overall accuracy of 75% was achieved using the gray matter features to classify patients with PANDAS and healthy controls.Conclusion The results of this integrative study allow a better understanding of the neural substrates in this OCD subtype, suggesting that the anatomical gray matter characteristics could have an immune origin that might be helpful in patient classification.";early-onset OCD | Gaussian process classifiers | gray matter | machine learning | MRI | multivariate pattern analysis | PANDAS;3;0;;;"J&amp;J";undefined;Eli Lilly and Company

TS-phenotype includes short stature, gonadal dysgenesis, cardiac and kidney malformations, low bone mineral density (low-BMD) and thyroiditis. TS-phenotype varies from patient to patient and the cause is not clear, the genomic background may be an important contributor for this variability. Our aim was to identify the association of specific single nucleotide variants in the PTPN22, VDR, KL, and CYP27B1 genes and vitamin D-metabolism, heart malformation, renal malformation, thyroiditis, and low-BMD in 61 Mexican TS-patients. DNA samples were genotyped for SNVs: rs7975232 (VDR), rs9536282 (KL), rs4646536 (CYP27B1), and rs1599971 (PTPN22) using the KASP assay. Chi-square test under a recessive model and multifactorial dimensionality reduction method were used for analysis. We found a significant association between renal malformation and the rs9536282 (KL) variant and between rs4646536 (CYP27B1) and low-BMD, these variants may have modest effects on these characteristics but contribute to the variability of the TS phenotype. In addition, we identified gene–gene interactions between variants in genes KL, CYP27B1 and VDR related to vitamin D-metabolism and low-BMD in TS-patients. Our results support the idea that the genetic background of TS-patients contributes to the clinical variability seen in them.;low bone mineral density | rs4646536 (CYP27B1) | rs7975232 (VDR) | rs9536282 (KL) | Turner syndrome;2;0;;;;057/2015;

Such relationships were explored during spontaneous and a controlled breathing tasks. Data analyzed were recordings obtained from 14 healthy subjects using one ECG lead and 21 EEG channels. The RR intervals from the ECG were used to obtain the HRV signal, which was decomposed with Empirical Mode Decomposition into components of different spectral content known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Granger causality tests were run for the BPts of alpha, beta and gamma frequency ranges of the EEG signal and the HRV signals IMFs. G-causality increased for three different conditions: slower IMFs (IMF4), BPts of higher frequency (gamma) band and during task realization. Meaning, gamma's BPts G-caused HRV for a larger number of subjects and channels. Also there was a larger incidence on the number of channels that G-caused HRV during the controlled breathing task. The causal influence from the BPts of EEG signals to the HRV IMFs suggests there is an indirect or unobserved interaction between instantaneous changes on EEG band power and components of HRV which may explain changes in its dynamics.;;1;0;;;;undefined;Universidad Iberoamericana Ciudad de México

Based on the threshold effect they showed, the time courses of all measures were divided into before (BTP) and after (ATP) threshold periods. Time courses of CFLFSP, CFLFDP and CFLFRR showed: 1. similar patterned responses of gradual increment in BTP, abrupt decrease in ATP and fast increment in the initial recovery period (IRP), inverse to the pattern presented by PLF dynamics; 2. 20-s epoch means (EM) differences (p<0.04) between them in control and BTP according to the inequality CFLFRR>CFLFSP>CFLFDP, that disappeared in ATP and IRP. CFLF-PLF correlations (p<0.01) of the three variables were negative and greater (p<0.01) in ATP than BTP and IRP.

The organic fractions (FAC1-1, FAC1-2) and aqueous fractions (FAqC2-1, FAqC2-3) were obtained by column chromatography and the HPLC analysis allowed the standardization based on the concentration (mg/g) of several compounds: FAqC2-1 with tiliroside 20, quercitrin 41.7, and quercetin glucoside 73.8; FAqC2-3 with tiliroside 2.4, quercitrin 16.6 and 7-O-luteolin glucoside 35.9; FAC1-1 caffeic acid was quantified with 7.87; FAC1-2 with tiliroside 24.7 and quercitrin 19.8. Each fraction was tested in ICR mice at different dose in the FST and TST, as well as in the open field test (OFT); tiliroside was isolated and tested in such assays (at 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg). All fractions were active, the better was FAC1-2, and induced a dose-dependent effect on FST with an ED50 = 2.59 mg/kg and Emax = 175.4 sec; with a sedative effect in OFT. Tiliroside with like-antidepressant activity, showed a dose-response behavior (ED50 = 0.04 mg/kg and Emax = 121.42 sec for FST; ED50 = 0.014 mg/kg and Emax = 78.28 sec for TST).";Antidepressant | Flavonoids | FST | Tilia americana | Tiliroside | TST;4;0;;;CONACYT;99186320;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

On farms where water buffalo are bred for milk production, early weaning favors the amount of milk produced, reduces breeding costs and improves the reproductive rate. However, this early separation may be associated with the restriction of colostrum and essential nutrients for water buffalo calves, which cannot be replaced by the use of milk replacers made for cattle. Consequently, colostrum restriction can lead to an increase in disease susceptibility, high mortality rates and compromises future performance. In addition, mothers show a more temperamental behavior, making milk ejection difficult due to the anatomical characteristics of the udder in this species. On the other hand, a continuous suckling system may be more beneficial to weight, immune status, and welfare of calves but may cause economic losses due to delayed postpartum estrus. The results in terms of susceptibility to stress are contradictory; some authors conclude that separation between mother and calves does not generate stress, as long as weaning is carried out within the first hours or days after birth (3–6 days old) after colostrum intake, compared to weaning at 45 and 90 days. However, these calves have greater difficulty in learning to eat on their own and show an increase in abnormal behaviors. The most commonly utilized form of weaning is abrupt. Behavioral and physiological indicators suggest that abrupt weaning is stressful for both the mother and the offspring. The protocols for performing gradual weaning seem to offer advantages in reducing stress in buffalo compared to abrupt weaning. On buffalo farms, calf management is one of the critical points of breeding, therefore, more studies are required to improve current breeding systems and promote the welfare of water buffalo calves.";Buffalo calves | Productivity | Stress | Weaning | Welfare;11;0;;;CONACYT;515743;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

These American anteater species currently face many conservation threats, among which road traffic accidents stand out. Parasitic studies on this family are scarce, and some of them include records of ectoparasites. Specifically for northern tamandua (T. mexicana), there is a lack of studies at population level. The objectives of the present research were to carry out an epidemiological study of tick species and its abundance on road-killed northern anteater specimens and, moreover, to perform a literature review of ticks collected from anteaters of Myrmecophagidae family. Five tick species were identified, including four Amblyomma spp. and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, on 23 road-killed anteaters. Tick infestation prevalence was 43% (10/23), with a median tick infestation intensity of 3.5 per anteater (interquartile range 1–13.7). The bibliographic review highlighted the existence of twenty-nine ixodid species recorded on the three anteater species from 14 countries, mainly Brazil. The most common tick species on the Myrmecophagidae family are Amblyomma nodosum, A. calcaratum, A. cajennense sensu lato and A. auricularium. Some of these ixodids were also described as vectors of pathogens. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of ticks on anteater fitness, and to assess the role of these mammals as reservoirs of vector-borne diseases.;Ectoparasite: Ixodid | Edentata | Myrmecophaga | Pilosa | Xenarthra;5;0;;;;undefined;

Participants were 781 women and 570 male students of a public university, with an average age of 20.1 years (SD = 2.7) and 21.2 years (SD = 3.3), respectively. The participants completed a set of self-report questionnaires, and their weight and height were measured. The prevalence of moderate frequency REB among women was 23.0% and high frequency 10.1%, while among men it was 22.3% and 6.7%, respectively (p = 0.07). Among women, the characteristics that increased the risk to present REB were: body dissatisfaction (OR = 5.4), negative affect (OR = 3.8), internalization of the ideal of thinness (OR = 3.6), and practicing some sport (OR = 2.8). Among men, these characteristics were: having being teased (OR = 10.3), drive for muscularity (OR = 3.4), body mass index (OR = 3.5) and practicing some sport (OR = 3.1). Given the different characteristics that increase the probability of presenting REB among university students and men, it is necessary to establish models that describe the specific risk conditions according to sex, as well as, to develop appropriate instruments and interventions.;Body image | Ideal of thinness | Muscularity | Risky eating behaviors | University students;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;CONACYT;403696;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In this context, the aim of the present study was to explore the complexity of EHG generated by women during the third trimester of pregnancy (group P) and at term labor (group L). The EHG was obtained by band-pass filtering in the range from 0.1 to 3 Hz the monopolar raw signal of the electrode number 1, of a 4-by-4 sensor array, which was located near to the tocodynamometer transducer. Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis measures the entropy over multiple time scales to provide the complexity of the EHG time series. The results pointed out that such nonlinear technique has the potential to discriminate contractions from both groups using the area under the MSE curve (AUC) as index. The highest complexity was obtained for group P (N= 8) as AUC was 13.9233 ± 0.2015 while the lowest complexity was for group L, with N=8 and AUC of 5.1675 ± 0.0783 (p<0.0001). Consequently, the complexity of EHG by MSE could provide an index to discriminate between the electrical uterine activity generated during pregnancy or at labor.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

Temporary solutions are renal replacement therapies such as peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration. These therapies as they are applied today are just partial measures and have many drawbacks and complications such as high mortality rates and high costs due to the use of supplemental drugs and emergency room visits. Many enhancements to the therapies have been published, but they are not applied consistently in real world practice. Our work presents the results from the systematic application of several techniques to provide individualized therapies that can minimize the drawbacks and improve patient outcomes. This approach is based on the use of exercise, analysis of cardiovascular parameters, such as heart-rate variability, body composition and dry weight measurements through the use of bioimpedance and real-time monitoring of energy expenditure and nutrition intradialytically in order to provide individualized and dynamically variable therapies. Results show that patients can lead long, productive lives while maintaining a quality of life equivalent to that of a renal transplant.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

However, it is still unknown whether low expression of E-cadherin is also present at the mRNA level in OSCC cases. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare E-cadherin mRNA expression in OSCC patients and controls and to correlate the expression with clinical and prospective characteristics. Material and Methods: Forty patients and 40 controls were enrolled. E-cadherin mRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan probes. Results: E-cadherin mRNA expression was significantly decreased in OSCC patients compared to that of controls (p<0.001). Whereas no significant association between clinical parameters and E-cadherin expression levels was observed, we noted lower E-cadherin expression levels in patients with positive lymph node metastasis. Conclusions: E-cadherin mRNA expression was markedly diminished in OSCC, in agreement with previous results that examined E-cadherin expression at the protein level. E-cadherin is downregulated in the early clinical stages of OSCC, and its mRNA levels do not change significantly in the advanced stages, suggesting that there is limited usefulness of this parameter for predicting disease progression.;E-cadherin | Gene expression | Oral cancer;8;1;repositoryam;Green;UdelaR;undefined;Universidad de la República Uruguay

The most common aetiological agents are Nocardia brasiliensis and Actinomadura madurae. In response to infection with these organisms the body produces an inflammatory immune response in the skin. The aim of the present study was to determine the production of chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides and the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in keratinocytes infected by A. madurae. Methods: A cell line of HaCaT keratinocytes was infected with A. madurae at a multiplicity of infection of 20:1 for 2 h and the samples were collected from 2 to 72 h post-infection. Intracellular replication of the bacterium was evaluated by counting of colony-forming units, the TLR expression and antimicrobial peptide production were assayed by confocal microscopy and chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Early in the infection, A. madurae was able to achieve intracellular replication in keratinocytes, however, the cells eventually controlled the infection. In response to the infection, keratinocytes overexpressed TLR2 and TLR6, produced high concentrations of cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin 8, human β-defensin-1, human β-defensin-2 and LL37 and low levels of tumour necrosis factor α. Conclusions: The human keratinocytes contribute to the inflammatory process in response to A. madurae infection by overexpressing TLRs and producing chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides.;Actinomadura madurae | Actinomycetoma | Inflammation | Innate immunity | Keratinocytes | Mycetoma | Skin;2;0;;;CONACYT;258735;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Groups of mice received intraperitoneal injections of 0.125 mg/g of BrdU 24 h prior to irradiation with 0.5 Gy of 60Co gamma rays. DNA breaks measured using SCGE were determined at 30 min after exposure to radiation. The kinetics of micronucleated reticulocyte (MN-RET) induction was determined every 8 h after irradiation up to 72 h. The results from both experimental models indicated that low-level BrdU incorporation into DNA increased the sensitivity to 0.5 Gy of radiation, particularly in the S phase. The formation of micronuclei by gamma rays was produced at three different times using two main mechanisms. In the BrdU-substituted cells, the second mechanism was associated with a high cytotoxic effect that was absent in the irradiated BrdU-unsubstituted cells. The third mechanism, in which micronucleus formation was increased in irradiated substituted cells compared with the irradiated nonsubstituted control cells, was also related to an increase in cytotoxicity.

comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on risks and risk–outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk–outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk–outcome associations. Methods We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk–outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017. Findings In 2017, 34·1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 33·3–35·0) deaths and 1·21 billion (1·14–1·28) DALYs were attributable to GBD risk factors. Globally, 61·0% (59·6–62·4) of deaths and 48·3% (46·3–50·2) of DALYs were attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the leading risk factor, accounting for 10·4 million (9·39–11·5) deaths and 218 million (198–237) DALYs, followed by smoking (7·10 million [6·83–7·37] deaths and 182 million [173–193] DALYs), high fasting plasma glucose (6·53 million [5·23–8·23] deaths and 171 million [144–201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4·72 million [2·99–6·70] deaths and 148 million [98·6–202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1·43 million [1·36–1·51] deaths and 139 million [131–147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable DALYs declined by 4·9% (3·3–6·5) between 2007 and 2017. In the absence of demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23·5% decline in DALYs during that period. Conversely, in the absence of changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18·6% increase in DALYs during that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels expected based on SDI (O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This result suggests that development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk structure in a population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given SDI, exposure to these risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for age-standardised DALY rates was high SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; south Asia; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the high-income super-region was smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for unsafe sex in sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa and the Middle East were notably low. Interpretation By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this assessment offers insight into where past policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights current priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks have largely offset the effects of population growth and ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the combination of increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive the increasing trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which presents both a public health challenge and opportunity. We see considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E ratios show risks for which countries are overperforming or underperforming relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure monitoring and epidemiological research to assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they highlight the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and robust conclusions that help to inform good policy and strategic health planning.";;3;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

For this reason, the objective of this work was to describe the effect of age and dissociative anesthetics (ketamine and tiletamine), and their combinations with acepromazine, xylazine and zolazepam, on the physiological and blood biochemical parameters in Macaca mulatta. Methods: Eighty male Macaca mulatta were divided into four experimental groups depending on the anesthetic mixture applied. Each group of 20 males was divided into five sub-groups according to age. Physiological parameters were recorded every 5 minutes during a 30-minute period. A blood sample was drawn to analyze blood biochemistry. Results: Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in the physiological parameters between the ketamine-acepromazine and ketamine-xylazine groups compared to the control group. The analysis of blood biochemistry found significant differences by age and by anesthetic mixture among all groups. Conclusion: These findings contribute to standardizing this animal model in biological research.;acepromazine | anesthesia | blood biochemistry | ketamine | Macaca mulatta | physiologic parameters | tiletamine | xylazine | zolazepam;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The study was carried out with 150 blood samples of English Thoroughbred horses clinically healthy. The blood sample collection was performed during three periods: 1) rest, 2) 30min after exercise (speed race of 12km/h for 30min with no rest) and 3) 60min after exercise. Mean values were calculated for cations (sodium and potassium) and anions (chloride and bicarbonate). The resulting data set was analyzed using Gaussian distribution and descriptive statistics. Confidence intervals of 95% were established. The linear relationships between ions were quantified, and an analysis of variance was performed to compare the mean values between groups. The concentrations of the described analytes are consistent with values reported by international literature. The comparison between groups, revealed that during exercise, sodium ion did not show changes 30min after exercise and increase 60min after. Potassium ion showed increase 30min after exercise and decrease 60min after. Chloride ion showed a decrease 30min after exercise, to recover gradually 60min after. Meanwhile, bicarbonate ion showed increase 30min after exercise, decreasing slightly in the final stage. Negative correlation between bicarbonate ion and chloride ion were determined. It was concluded that exercise tests are useful for the determination of acid-base balance and osmotic balance, and their main role is to evaluate the athletic ability of horses.Considering that chloride ion excretion and metabolic adjustments of potassium ion and bicarbonate ion are superior to water loss, compared to the normal osmolarity of blood serum. The results found can be used to structure an adequate replacement program of electrolytes lost in sweat.;Blood chemistry | English thoroughbred horses | Metabolic profile | Osmotic balance;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are master regulators of gene expression that control oncogenic pathways to modulate the radiotherapy response of cells. In the present study, differential expression profiling assays identified 16 deregulated miRNAs in acquired radioresistant breast cancer cells, of which miR-122 was observed to be up-regulated. Functional analysis revealed that miR-122 has a role as a tumor suppressor in parental cells by decreasing survival and promoting radiosensitivity. However, in radioresistant cells, miR-122 functions as an oncomiR by promoting survival. The transcriptomic landscape resulting from knockdown of miR-122 in radioresistant cells showed modulation of the ZNF611, ZNF304, RIPK1, HRAS, DUSP8 and TNFRSF21 genes. Moreover, miR-122 and the set of affected genes were prognostic factors in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. Our data indicate that up-regulation of miR-122 promotes cell survival in acquired radioresistant breast cancer and also suggest that miR-122 differentially controls the response to radiotherapy by a dual function as a tumor suppressor an and oncomiR dependent on cell phenotype.;breast cancer | microRNAs | miR-122 | radioresistance;29;1;repositoryvor;Green;ICyTDF;115591;Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnología del Distrito Federal

The aim of this analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders. Methods: We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories (tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach. Findings: Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs (276 million [95% UI 247–308]) and second leading cause of deaths (9·0 million [8·8–9·4]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% [34–44] and DALYs by 15% [9–21]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% [26–30] and DALYs by 27% [24–31]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were stroke (42·2% [38·6–46·1]), migraine (16·3% [11·7–20·8]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10·4% [9·0–12·1]), and meningitis (7·9% [6·6–10·4]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 1·12 [1·05–1·20]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female ratios of less than 0·7. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88·8% (86·5–90·9) of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22·3% [11·8–35·1] of DALYs are risk attributable) and idiopathic epilepsy (14·1% [10·8–17·5] of DALYs are risk attributable). Interpretation: Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase. As populations are growing and ageing, and the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders steeply increases with age, governments will face increasing demand for treatment, rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders. The scarcity of established modifiable risks for most of the neurological burden demonstrates that new knowledge is required to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

Method: The study cohort included 7396 patients with ACS. We sought to derive and internally validate an inflammation-based score that included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and serum albumin level at admission to evaluate the predictive role of systemic inflammation in the clinical outcome of these patients. We randomly assigned patients into derivation (66.6%) and validation (33.4%) cohorts. A total of four categories of systemic inflammation were defined. Results: Assessed individually, the three biomarkers were associated with a higher rate of in-hospital mortality. When we combined them into an inflammation score, in-hospital mortality was significantly different across the four categories of inflammation in the derivation cohort (1.8%, 2.8%, 4.1%, and 13.8% for without, mild, moderate, and severe inflammation, respectively; p < 0.0001, C-statistic, 0.71). These results were similar in the validation cohort (1.1%, 2.9%, 5.2%, and 12.6%, respectively; p < 0.0001, C-statistic, 0.71). After multivariate adjustment, only the category of severe systemic inflammation was associated with a threefold increased risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratios 3.02, p < 0.0001) and was the most powerful predictor of mortality. In the whole cohort, after subsetting patients based on GRACE risk score, the severe inflammation category was associated with a significant increase of in-hospital mortality across all sub-groups, mainly in patients with higher GRACE risk score. The inflammation-based risk score reclassified 25.3% of the population. The net reclassification index was 8.2% (p = 0.001). Conclusion: A risk score system based on biomarkers of inflammation readily available at admission in patients with ACS, could better assess the inflammatory status and predict in-hospital mortality, as well as severe systemic inflammation that contributes to a worse outcome independently of clinical risk factors.";Acute coronary syndrome | Anti-inflammatory therapies | Inflammatory risk score | Non-ST-elevation-acute coronary syndrome | Risk-stratification | ST-elevation myocardial infarction;10;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

But while most studies have focused on sloth species, anteaters have been overlooked, and in many Leishmania endemic countries like Mexico, no studies have been carried out. The aims of this work were to identify the presence of Leishmania spp. in tissue samples from road-killed northern tamanduas (Tamandua mexicana), using PCR amplification and sequencing of ITS1 DNA, and to discuss the role of Pilosa mammals as reservoirs of Leishmania based on available scientific records. This is the first study that identifies Leishmania in T. mexicana, from 1 of 16 individuals analyzed, so the estimated prevalence (CI 95%) of infection was 6.3% (0.3–27.2). Amplified sequence exhibited a 98.9% (727/735) similarity with L. mexicana, and phylogenetic analysis grouped the species in the L. mexicana-amazonensis cluster. The literature review revealed 241 cases of Leishmania spp. infection among 1219 Pilosa mammals evaluated, with prevalence between studies ranging from 3.5% in the brown-throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) to 78% in the Hoffman’s two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni). Current scientific information indicates that C. hoffmanni sloths are reservoirs of Leishmania, and further studies are needed in order to clarify if other Pilosa species play a role in Leishmania transmission.;Edentata | Leishmaniasis | Mexico | Myrmecophaga | Tamandua mexicana | Xenarthra;4;0;;;;undefined;

Alcohol, which can disrupt folate absorption, is also known to affect the epigenome. We investigated the association of dietary folate and alcohol intake on leukocyte DNA methylation levels in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Leukocyte genome-wide DNA methylation profiles on approximately 450,000 CpG sites were acquired with Illumina HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip measured among 450 women control participants of a case-control study on breast cancer nested within the EPIC cohort. After data preprocessing using surrogate variable analysis to reduce systematic variation, associations of DNA methylation with dietary folate and alcohol intake, assessed with dietary questionnaires, were investigated using CpG site-specific linear models. Specific regions of the methylome were explored using differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis and fused lasso (FL) regressions. The DMR analysis combined results from the feature-specific analysis for a specific chromosome and using distances between features as weights whereas FL regression combined two penalties to encourage sparsity of single features and the difference between two consecutive features. Results: After correction for multiple testing, intake of dietary folate was not associated with methylation level at any DNA methylation site, while weak associations were observed between alcohol intake and methylation level at CpG sites cg03199996 and cg07382687, with q val = 0.029 and q val = 0.048, respectively. Interestingly, the DMR analysis revealed a total of 24 and 90 regions associated with dietary folate and alcohol, respectively. For alcohol intake, 6 of the 15 most significant DMRs were identified through FL. Conclusions: Alcohol intake was associated with methylation levels at two CpG sites. Evidence from DMR and FL analyses indicated that dietary folate and alcohol intake may be associated with genomic regions with tumor suppressor activity such as the GSDMD and HOXA5 genes. These results were in line with the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the association between folate and alcohol, although further studies are warranted to clarify the importance of these mechanisms in cancer.;Alcohol intake | Dietary folate | DMR | DNA methylation | EPIC cohort | Fused lasso;18;1;repositoryvor;Green;ARC;PI13/00061;Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer

We aim to investigate the detailed metabolic profile of SLC16A11 risk haplotype carriers to identify potential physiological mechanisms explaining the increased type 2 diabetes risk. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: We evaluated carriers (n = 72) and non-carriers (n = 75) of the SLC16A11 risk haplotype, with or without type 2 diabetes. An independent sample of 1069 subjects was used to re plicate biochemical findings. The evaluation included euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), MRI and spectroscopy and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies. Results: Fat-free mass (FFM)-adjusted M value was lower in carriers of the SLC16A11 risk haplotype after adjusting for age and type 2 diabetes status (β = .0.164, P = 0.04). Subjects with type 2 diabetes and the risk haplotype demonstrated an increase of 8.76 U/L in alanine aminotransferas e (ALT) (P = 0.02) and of 7.34 U/L in gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT) (P = 0.05) compared with non-carriers and after adjusting for gende r, age and ancestry. Among women with the risk haplotype and normal BMI, the adipocyte size was higher (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Individuals carrying the SLC16A11 risk haplotype exhibited decreased insulin action. Higher serum ALT and GGT levels were found in carriers with type 2 diabetes, and larger adipocytes in subcutaneous fat in the size distribution in carrier women with normal weight.;;8;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The study involved 1260 piglets born to 90 sows (Yorkshire-Landrace × Large-White) classified based on parity as primiparous (n = 30), 2nd–5th parity (n = 30), and 6th–7th parity (n = 30). The vitality of piglets was determined using a numerical score based on respiratory latency, heartbeats, skin color, latency to stand up, and meconium staining of the skin. Temperatures were taken at birth (T1), drying (T2), initial ingestion of colostrum (T3) and 24 hr after birth (T4). The piglets were weighed immediately after being removed from the sow for skin drying. Piglets with low vitality born to primiparous sows had lower birth weights (P < 0.05). The piglets born to 2nd–5th parity sows and exhibited low or medium vitality had a lower temperature at T1(1 °C) and T2 (2 °C) compared to the high vitality groups (P < 0.05). The piglets born to 6–7th parity sows and exhibited high vitality increased the temperature by 1.5 °C at T4 compared to those of the low and medium vitality groups. It was concluded that independently of parity, piglets with low birth weights and low vitality scores at birth are unable to increase ocular temperature even after ingesting colostrum.;Farrowing | Neonate | Piglet | Sows | Thermographic | Welfare;14;0;;;;undefined;

However, one of the limitations for the advancement of data and literature-driven research has been the lack of flexibility of the methodological resources used in qualitative research. There is a need to incorporate friendly, cheaper and faster tools for the systematic, unbiased analysis of large data corpora, in particular regarding the qualitative aspects of the information (often overlooked). Methods: This article proposes a series of novel techniques, exemplified by the case of the role of Institutional Committees of Bioethics to (1) massively identify the documents relevant to a given issue, (2) extract the fundamental content, focusing on qualitative analysis, (3) synthesize the findings in the published literature, (4) categorize and visualize the evidence, and (5) analyse and report the results. Results: A critical study of the institutional role of public health policies and practices in Institutional Committees of Bioethics was used as an example application of the method. Interactive strategies were helpful to define and conceptualise variables, propose research questions and refine research interpretation. These methods are additional aids to systematic reviews, pre-coding schemes and construction of a priori diagrams to survey and analyse social science literature. Conclusions: These novel methods have proven to facilitate the formulation and testing of hypotheses on the subjects to be studied. Such tools may allow important advances going from descriptive approaches to decision-making and even institutional assessment and policy redesign, by pragmatic reason of time and costs.;Algorithms | Complex networks | Data mining | Health policy | Healthcare economics and organisations | Social control policies;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;179431/2012;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

However, the presence of undetected population structure can lead to both false positive results and failures to detect genuine associations. Even when most of the approaches to deal with population stratification require genome-wide data, the use of a well-selected panel of ancestry informative markers (AIMs) may appropriately correct for population stratification. Few panels of AIMs have been developed for Latino populations and most contain a high number of markers (> 100 AIMs). For some association studies such as candidate gene approaches, it may be unfeasible to genotype a numerous set of markers to avoid false positive results. In such cases, methods that use fewer AIMs may be appropriate. Results: We validated an accurate and cost-effective panel of AIMs, for use in population stratification correction of association studies and global ancestry estimation in Mexicans, as well as in populations having large proportions of both European and Native American ancestries. Based on genome-wide data from 1953 Mexican individuals, we performed a PCA and SNP weights were calculated to select subsets of unlinked AIMs within percentiles 0.10 and 0.90, ensuring that all chromosomes were represented. Correlations between PC1 calculated using genome-wide data versus each subset of AIMs (16, 32, 48 and 64) were r 2 = 0.923, 0.959, 0.972 and 0.978, respectively. When evaluating PCs performance as population stratification adjustment covariates, no correlation was found between P values obtained from uncorrected and genome-wide corrected association analyses (r 2 = 0.141), highlighting that population stratification correction is compulsory for association analyses in admixed populations. In contrast, high correlations were found when adjusting for both PC1 and PC2 for either subset of AIMs (r 2 > 0.900). After multiple validations, including an independent sample, we selected a minimal panel of 32 AIMs, which are highly informative of the major ancestral components of Mexican mestizos, namely European and Native American ancestries. Finally, the correlation between the global ancestry proportions calculated using genome-wide data and our panel of 32 AIMs was r 2 = 0.972. Conclusions: Our panel of 32 AIMs accurately estimated global ancestry and corrected for population stratification in association studies in Mexican individuals.;AIM | Ancestry | Association study | Mexican mestizos | Population stratification;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In domestic dogs, maternal behaviour shown by the dam mainly consists of contact, nursing, grooming/licking, play, punishment, thermoregulation, and motion. Peer-reviewed literature published between 1952 and 2018 was retrieved from CAB Abstracts, PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus and book chapters. Keywords for this search included the following terms: behaviour, bonding, altricial, precocial, offspring, maternal, whelping, nursing, domestic dogs, female dog, aggression, puppies, anogenital licking. In this review, we reported and discussed scientific information about maternal behaviour in domestic bitches, comparing altricial vs precocial species; the importance of the bonding, grooming/licking and nursing, and their impacts on puppies’ behaviour; altered maternal behaviours such as aggression, cannibalism, rejection, and also the relation between hormones and maternal care behaviours. We concluded that the level of interactions between the dam and the puppies influences the physiological, cognitive and behavioural development of the litter, and the main hormones in the bitch for inducing maternal care behaviours are estradiol, oxytocin, prolactin and progesterone.";dog behaviour | Maternal care | nursing | puppy welfare | whelping;23;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

A systematic review was conducted answering the following PECO question: Population / young adults; Exposure / negative comments, criticism or teasing about weight and shape by parents; Comparison groups / not applicable; and Outcome / DEBs. Due to the use of different statistical measurements, a narrative was chosen to present the results. An association between negative comments and DEBs was found in male and female university students. Women reported more negative comments, higher body dissatisfaction and DEBs than men. Body dissatisfaction was found as a mediator of negative comments and DEBs, and sex as a moderator between body dissatisfaction and DEBs. The results have implications for the influence social pressure has on the internalization of the thin-ideal and on body dissatisfaction as risk factors for the development of disordered eating behaviours.";Body image | Disordered eating | Eating disorders | Negative comments | Parental influences;1;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Methods: This is an ambispective descriptive longitudinal study of the evolution of visual acuity and development, using Teller Acuity Cards, Retinoscopy, and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third edition. Eight patients with CCB were included to establish the general conditions of onset with a longitudinal follow-up after surgery. Patients were divided into two groups considering the age of treatment (early treatment < 6 months; late treatment > 6 months). We used non-parametric statistics by means of trend test in the two groups using a significance level of p < 0.05. Through a qualitative analysis a description of the visual development was made. Results: Refractive errors decreased progressively with statistically significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.01). The cognitive area exhibited better outcomes with a significant difference (p = 0.012) in the early treatment group. Conclusions: Late surgical treatment led to severe changes in the organization of the visual function, as well as in observable behaviors of the motor, cognitive, and language areas, limiting the comprehensive and proper individuals' development. It is necessary to implement strategies that include visual rehabilitation and early intervention for development changes.";Amblyopia | Congenital cataract | Development | Visual deprivation | Visual function;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

An experiment was conducted to evaluate the feed intake, digestibility and growth of pigs fed with two feeds (A and K) specially formulated for this species and a commercial feed for growing rabbits with supplementation of vitamin C (RF+VC). Materials and methods. Eighteen Guinea pigs of 248±38 g initial body weight were distributed in a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement 3×2 (dietary treatments and sex). Feed and neutral detergent fiber intake, weight gain, feed/gain, and morphometric variables were measured individually for 30 days. Dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility were measured during the last seven days of the experiment. Results. There were no differences on feed intake (p=0.88); however, the dry matter digestibility was higher (p<0.01) in feeds formulated for Guinea pigs (A and K) and lower in the rabbit feed plus vitamin C. The intake and digestibility of NDF were higher in the RF+VC and lower in feeds for Guinea pigs (p< 0.01). The average daily gain was similar among the treatments (p>0.05). There were no differences (p>0.01) in the morphometric variables among dietary treatments, but there were sex differences as the males were bigger than the females (p<0.01). Conclusions.

Prevention;13538047;15054;14755785;Journal;;;043296;;Background: The epidemiological transition of non-communicable diseases replacing infectious diseases as the main contributors to disease burden has been well documented in global health literature. Less focus, however, has been given to the relationship between sociodemographic changes and injury. The aim of this study was to examine the association between disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from injury for 195 countries and territories at different levels along the development spectrum between 1990 and 2017 based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates. Methods: Injury mortality was estimated using the GBD mortality database, corrections for garbage coding and CODEm-the cause of death ensemble modelling tool. Morbidity estimation was based on surveys and inpatient and outpatient data sets for 30 cause-of-injury with 47 nature-of-injury categories each. The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) is a composite indicator that includes lagged income per capita, average educational attainment over age 15 years and total fertility rate. Results: For many causes of injury, age-standardised DALY rates declined with increasing SDI, although road injury, interpersonal violence and self-harm did not follow this pattern. Particularly for self-harm opposing patterns were observed in regions with similar SDI levels. For road injuries, this effect was less pronounced. Conclusions: The overall global pattern is that of declining injury burden with increasing SDI. However, not all injuries follow this pattern, which suggests multiple underlying mechanisms influencing injury DALYs. There is a need for a detailed understanding of these patterns to help to inform national and global efforts to address injury-related health outcomes across the development spectrum.;burden of disease | descriptive epidemiology | epidemiology;21;1;repositoryam;Green;FP7;201900;Seventh Framework Programme

While online and offline gaming may produce undesired negative effects on players, we know little about the nosology of IGD and its prevalence, especially in countries with emerging economies. Methods: A self-administered survey has been employed to estimate prevalence of DSM-5 IGD and study the structure and performance of an instrument in Spanish to measure DSM-5 IGD among 7,022 first-year students in 5 Mexican universities that participated in the University Project for Healthy Students (PUERTAS), part of the World Health Organization’s World Mental Health International College Student Initiative. Results: The scale for IGD showed unidimensionality with factor loadings between 0.694 and 0.838 and a Cronbach’s α = .816. Items derived from gaming and from substance disorders symptoms mixed together. We found a 12-month prevalence of IGD of 5.2% in the total sample; prevalence was different for males (10.2%) and females (1.2%), but similar for ages 18–19 years (5.0%) and age 20+ (5.8%) years. Among gamers, the prevalence was 8.6%. Students with IGD were more likely to report lifetime psychological or medical treatment [OR = 1.8 (1.4–2.4)] and any severe role impairment [OR = 2.4 (1.7–3.3)]. Adding any severe role impairment to the diagnostic criteria decreased the 12-month prevalence of IGD to 0.7%. Discussion and conclusions: Prevalence of DSM-5 IGD and the performance of diagnostic criteria in this Mexican sample were within the bounds of what is reported elsewhere. Importantly, about one in every seven students with IGD showed levels of impairment that would qualify them for treatment under DSM-5.";College students | DSM-5 | Epidemiology | Gaming | Mexico;11;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;CB 285548;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Secondary compounds within the extracts were identified by high performance liquid chromatography. Five extract concentrations were assessed in the inhibition tests (25.0, 12.5, 6.2, 3.1 and 1.5 mg/mL), using distilled water and Thiabendazole (0.5 mg/mL) as negative and positive controls, respectively. The results were analysed under a 2 × 2 × 6 completely randomized factorial design, and mean differences were established by the Tukey’s post hoc test. The 50% (EC50) and 90% (EC90) effective concentrations for each extract were determined using a Probit analysis. A concentration-depen-dent ovicidal effect of hydro-alcoholic extracts from both leaves and fruits was observed, reaching a 100% efficacy against both nematode species with the 25.0 mg/mL concentration (p < 0.05). The EC50 for the fruit and leaves extracts were established as 1.63 and 3.91 mg/mL, and as 3.98 and 11.68 mg/mL, against H. contortus and H. placei, respectively.

Identification and quantification of PAHs requires analytical methods that allow more accurate and complete estimates. An analysis was done of the sixteen PAHs considered priority by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in whole milk from Mexico City, and this used to compare three milk fat extraction procedures. Of the four milk brands analyzed, three were ultrapasteurized (UHT) and one was pasteurized (HTST). The milk was acquired from March-June 2016. Three extraction methods were tested: saponification (method A); detergent solution extraction (method B); and liquid-liquid extraction (method C). The PAH profiles from each method were generated by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. Three of the four milk brands (75 %) were positive for at least one of the sixteen analyzed PAHs. Profiles differed by extraction method with only low molecular weight compounds in method A, both low and high molecular weight compounds in method B, and higher recovery rates of low and high molecular weight compounds in method C. This method produced better recovery rates for low (58.7-12.3) and high molecular weight PAHs (81.8-8.0) than in method B (low molecular weight = 15.0-8.0, high molecular weight = 58.0-21.0).";Extraction methods | Gas chromatography | Milk | Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Suicidal behaviour is a major health problem in Spain. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the recurrence of suicide attempts and the level of lethality reached, and the profile of repeaters who perform more lethal attempts. Method. All patients admitted for attempted suicide in a health area of 360,000 inhabitants from 2009 to 2014 (N=711) were systematically assessed. We compared clinical and demographic characteristics of these patients in terms of lethality (low versus moderate-severe) and recidivism (1-2 attempts versus >2 attempts) using univariate analyses and regression models. Later, we repeated the analyses after distributing the sample into four groups depending on the presence or absence of high lethality and/or recidivism. Results. Recidivism was associated with the middle-age group (35-65 years), the lack of professional activity, and personality or substance use disorders. Lethality was associated with male gender, extreme age-groups, the use of a violent method, and affective disorders, but not with recidivism. Multiple suicide attempts and high lethality in a single patient was associated with 35-65 years age-group, male gender, violent methods, mental disorders, and inactivity. Conclusions. Different demographic and clinical factors indicate an increased risk of medical lethality and recurrence in suicidal patients.

The pathophysiology of MAS is complex. The underlying mechanism of MAS is fetal hypoxia which causes redistribution of fetal blood, increased intestinal peristalsis and relaxation of the anal sphincter in utero, leading to the passage of meconium into the amniotic fluid. If hypoxia is severe and persistent, the fetus gasps for air, but instead aspirate amniotic fluid contaminated with meconium. Aspiration of meconium produces multiple physiological and structural changes in the neonatal lung which relates partially to the amount of aspirated meconium. The structural and functional sequels of MAS include airways obstruction, atelectasis, chemical pneumonitis, hypoxemia, acidosis, pulmonary hypertension and occasionally death. MAS survivors can develop airway hyperreactivity and nervous sequelae. The morbidity and mortality of human MAS have declined the last decades because of new therapies but remains a major paediatric problem. Although the prevalence and significance of MAS in veterinary medicine have been poorly investigated, there is ample evidence that intrapartum hypoxia in animals also causes meconium expulsion, amniotic staining and aspiration. The lungs of affected animals showed airway obstruction, focal atelectasis and alveolitis. Meconium staining of the skin and aspiration are indicators of fetal or perinatal hypoxia and postnatal respiratory distress in domestic animals. Experimental models have been developed to study the pathogenesis of MAS in laboratory animals. This review focuses on the current concepts of the pathophysiology of MAS in human and veterinary medicine.;Anoxia | Asphyxia | MAS | Meconium | Neonate;7;0;;;;undefined;

Galphimia glauca has been used for many years in Mexican Traditional Medicine to calm ""insane people."" Triterpenes, known as galphimines, were identified in this species. One of them, Galphimine-B (G-B), acts selectively on dopaminergic neurons by antagonizing the effect of glutamate on NMDA receptors. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of G. glauca methanolic extract (GgMeOH), a Galphimine-Rich Fraction (GRF), as well as the galphimines G-A, G-B, and G-E, on the acute psychosis induced by Apomorphine (APO) in mice and on schizophrenia-like symptoms induced by subchronic administration of MK-801. Method. On the first day, ICR male mice were given GgMeOH, GRF, or one of the galphimines. On day two, animals were treated with APO, and on day 3, they were subjected to behavioral tests. In a second test, MK-801 was administered daily for 28 days. In this case, animals were treated daily with G. glauca products from day 9 to day 28 and then subjected to behavioral tests (passive avoidance test, open field test, forced swimming test, and social interaction test). Results. The increased number of stereotyped behaviors and grooming behaviors induced with APO were counteracted by all of the experimental treatments. MK-801 induced an increase in immobility time, which was blocked with G-B; GRF counteracted the decreased social interaction, and GgMeOH and GRF prevented the memory loss induced by MK-801. Conclusion. G. glauca and their derivatives products (GRF and galphimines) were able to interact with the dopaminergic and glutamatergic drugs and to block different behaviors associated with some of the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of induced schizophrenia in mice. It is necessary to continue with this research, in order to identify their mechanism of action.";;3;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;SALUD-2015-CO1-261591;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The etiology of these pathologies remains unknown; however, mitochondrial function has been proposed as a common factor that could be involved in the establishment of these diseases, owing to the high energy requirement neurons have in order to carry out their physiological functions. Mitochondria are extremely dynamic organelles that can change their morphology and function in response to different physiological stimuli and, for this reason, mitochondrial dynamics have started being studied as one of cell survival main regulators. This event comprises different processes, such as the generation of new mitochondria and their elimination when they are no longer functional, as well as mitochondrial fusion and fission processes and the traffic of these organelles within the cellular environment. All these processes are highly regulated, and their main purpose is optimal functionality of mitochondria and cellular homeostasis.";Mitochondria | Neurodegenerative diseases | Neurons | Oxidative stress;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;/298/2016;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The mean age of the 96 piglets that participated was 27 days. The piglets were weaned and then housed under two conditions: with no disruption of the social order (SO), and with disruption of the social order (DSO). After establishing the two experimental conditions, we proceeded to evaluate four different treatments; namely, control (C), suspended ropes (SR), aromatized bottles (AB) and pet toys and balls (PTB). The protocol required drawing three blood samples: at 30 (T30), 60 (T60) and 90 min (T90) after weaning. The DSO piglets had higher pH and haematocrit levels than those weaned in the SO condition (P < 0.05). Also, pCO2, potassium (K+) and base excess (BE) concentrations were higher in the SO animals than in those in the DSO group (P < 0.05). The control piglets, which did not receive any type of EE, showed higher pCO2 levels, but lower glucose and pH (P < 0.05) values, while the ones enriched with SR had increased lactate levels, but lower values for pH and HCO3– compared to the piglets in the other EE treatment regimens (P < 0.05). The SR-enriched piglets had higher lactate and haematocrit levels, but lower values for pH and bicarbonate (HCO3–) than the animals in the other EE groups (P < 0.005). The piglets subjected to sensorial EE with AB had higher plasma glucose than the ones in the other groups (P < 0.005). Finally, the PTB-enriched subjects showed higher Na+ levels than controls (P < 0.005). The alterations that were found to be related to the factor sampling time were more pronounced at T30 (P < 0.05) than T60 and T90.

Stepwise regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships of biochemical analytes with the fat and protein content of the milk from 126 Holstein cows belonging to nine intensive housed dairy farms. The comparison between the two groups showed differences (P<0.05) in the milk yield, milk fat and milk fat/protein ratio, with the higher values in high-yield cows. The correlations between milk fat, milk protein, milk fat/protein ratio and biochemical analytes concentrations, were assessed within each group. Milk fat level was positively correlated to cholesterol, triglycerides, β-hydroxybutyrate and albumin in high-yield cows. Milk protein level was positively correlated to urea, and negatively correlated to sodium ion, potassium ion and chlorine ion in high-yield cows. A virtually linear dependence has also been found between milk fat and triglycerides, between milk protein and urea, and between milk fat/protein ratio and cholesterol, and triglycerides in low-yield cows.

We aimed to measure the incidence, prevalence, and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for TBI and SCI from all causes of injury in every country, to describe how these measures have changed between 1990 and 2016, and to estimate the proportion of TBI and SCI cases caused by different types of injury. Methods We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2016 to measure the global, regional, and national burden of TBI and SCI by age and sex. We measured the incidence and prevalence of all causes of injury requiring medical care in inpatient and outpatient records, literature studies, and survey data. By use of clinical record data, we estimated the proportion of each cause of injury that required medical care that would result in TBI or SCI being considered as the nature of injury. We used literature studies to establish standardised mortality ratios and applied differential equations to convert incidence to prevalence of long-term disability. Finally, we applied GBD disability weights to calculate YLDs. We used a Bayesian meta-regression tool for epidemiological modelling, used causespecific mortality rates for non-fatal estimation, and adjusted our results for disability experienced with comorbid conditions. We also analysed results on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index, a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility. Findings In 2016, there were 27.08 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 24.30-30.30 million) new cases of TBI and 0.93 million (0.78-1.16 million) new cases of SCI, with age-standardised incidence rates of 369 (331-412) per 100 000 population for TBI and 13 (11-16) per 100 000 for SCI. In 2016, the number of prevalent cases of TBI was 55.50 million (53.40-57.62 million) and of SCI was 27.04 million (24.98-30.15 million). From 1990 to 2016, the agestandardised prevalence of TBI increased by 8.4% (95% UI 7.7 to 9.2), whereas that of SCI did not change significantly (-0.2% [-2.1 to 2.7]). Age-standardised incidence rates increased by 3.6% (1.8 to 5.5) for TBI, but did not change significantly for SCI (-3.6% [-7.4 to 4.0]). TBI caused 8.1 million (95% UI 6.0-10.4 million) YLDs and SCI caused 9.5 million (6.7-12.4 million) YLDs in 2016, corresponding to age-standardised rates of 111 (82-141) per 100 000 for TBI and 130 (90-170) per 100 000 for SCI. Falls and road injuries were the leading causes of new cases of TBI and SCI in most regions. Interpretation TBI and SCI constitute a considerable portion of the global injury burden and are caused primarily by falls and road injuries. The increase in incidence of TBI over time might continue in view of increases in population density, population ageing, and increasing use of motor vehicles, motorcycles, and bicycles. The number of individuals living with SCI is expected to increase in view of population growth, which is concerning because of the specialised care that people with SCI can require. Our study was limited by data sparsity in some regions, and it will be important to invest greater resources in collection of data for TBI and SCI to improve the accuracy of future assessments.;;631;1;repositoryam;Green;BMGF;PCT/AU2008/001556;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

A total of 60 male piglets were divided into five groups of 12 each, based on the surgical method employed and the use, or not, of local anesthesia, as follows: surgical castration using one horizontal incision in both testicles with (C1+L) and without (C1) local anesthesia; surgical castration using two vertical scrotal incisions with and without local anesthesia (C2+L and C2); and control piglets which were removed from their pens and held head-down by their hind limbs for approximately 90 s to simulate castration (SIM). Reference blood samples were drawn 24 h before castration (RV), immediately after surgery or simulated castration (PC), and at 24 and 48 h post-castration, to determine physiological profiles including; pH, hematocrit, glucose, electrolytes, lactate, pCO2 (mmHg), SO2 (mmHg), and bicarbonate. Results showed increases in lactate and hematocrit immediately after surgical or simulated castration with decreases in pH, HCO3− and base excess (BE). Surgical castration produced marked alterations of the physiological profile, detected by reduced pH and HCO3, higher lactate levels and BE alterations. These changes indicated metabolic acidosis that was greater in the piglets castrated surgically with one horizontal incision than in those castrated with two vertical incisions. More research is needed on the use of lidocaine during surgical castration, as it showed no effect on physiological profile in this study, but did alter hematocrit values.";Animal welfare | Blood gas test | Lidocaine | Local anesthesia | Orchiectomy | Physiological profiles;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Latin American (LA) countries members of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) are under the urge and should be obligated to teach AW. The aims of this article are to analyze the current drives of change on the importance of teaching animal welfare in LA, the competences recommended from international education organizations for the region, and to provide the contents on the curriculum in AW that a future veterinarian should achieve in the LA scenario, in other words to examine why teaching AW, what should be taught and how. Despite significant advances in introducing AW into veterinary training programs, much remains to be done regarding the future of this field in teaching veterinary science in Spain and LA countries, and in including this science as an independent course in programs at distinct levels to integrate the scientific, ethical and legal aspects of AW. This paper presents a proposal that was constructed with a view towards integrating diverse curricular approaches based on criteria, contents and concepts provided by the researchers and professors who collaborated in the book entitled: Bienestar Animal: Una Visión Global en Iberoamerica [Animal Welfare: A Global Vision in Ibero-America]. To ensure veterinary students will be better equipped to graduate with OIE day 1 competencies in AW, teaching approaches are needed that support project-based learning and gamification, critical thinking, reflection and collaborative learning.;Animal welfare | Study plans | Study programs | Teaching | Veterinary medicine;35;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The conal and atrioventricular cushion mesenchyme changes during transformation into mature structures and their role in apoptosis were also investigated. Methods Plastic labels were placed at the cephalic and caudal conal limits of chicken embryo hearts (stage 22HH) and traced up to stage 36HH. Histological analyses, scanning electron microscopy and apoptotic detection using Lysotracker-Red were performed. The conal longitudinal length and medial displacement were registered. Muscle myosin was identified by immunofluorescence. Results Labels positioned in the myocardium of each conal wall moved to the right ventricle (RV), shifting from the arterial subvalvular myocardial zone to the apex. No labels were found in the aortic vestibule. At stage 22HH, the conus was a tubular structure composed of myocardium and endocardium with scarce mesenchyme. The dorso-left conal myocardial wall gradually lost continuity and the free ends separated, while the myocardium was distributed to the RV free wall (24HH-28HH). At stage 22HH, conal crests were not observed, but they were apparent at the dorsal zone of the conus at stage 26HH; towards stage 30HH, they fused to form the supraventricular crest, and the pulmonary infundibulum was evident. The ventro-superior cushion of the AV canal was reorganized into the fibrous and muscular structures lined the aortic vestibule. Conclusions The posterior conus is an erroneous concept. The conal myocardium is reorganized in the free wall of the RV. Internally, the conal lumen is transformed into the pulmonary infundibulum. The aortic vestibule is formed from the ventro-superior cushion of the AV canal. Thus, the ventricular outflow tracts have different embryonic origins.";;4;1;repositoryam;Green;UAM;36970;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

(CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on risks and risk-outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk-outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk- outcome associations. Methods We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017.";;2381;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;P30AG047845;National Institutes of Health

November 2018;The Lancet;01406736;16590;1474547X;Journal;392;10159;;1789-1858;"Background: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. Methods: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Findings: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3·9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1-4·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7·2% (6·0-8·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7·9% (6·6-9·2) for males and 6·5% (5·4-7·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95% UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs 1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). Interpretation: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.";;5774;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;P30AG047845;National Institutes of Health

November 2018;The Lancet;01406736;16590;1474547X;Journal;392;10159;;1859-1922;Background: How long one lives, how many years of life are spent in good and poor health, and how the population's state of health and leading causes of disability change over time all have implications for policy, planning, and provision of services. We comparatively assessed the patterns and trends of healthy life expectancy (HALE), which quantifies the number of years of life expected to be lived in good health, and the complementary measure of disability-adjusted lifeyears (DALYs), a composite measure of disease burden capturing both premature mortality and prevalence and severityof ill health, for 359 diseases and injuries for 195 countries and territories over the past 28 years. Methods We used data for age-speci?c mortality rates, years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality, and years lived with disability (YLDs) from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to calculate HALE and DALYs from 1990 to 2017. We calculated HALE using age-specific mortality rates and YLDs per capita for each location, age, sex, and year. We calculated DALYs for 359 causes as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. We assessed how observed HALE and DALYs differed by country and sex from expected trends based on Sociodemographic Index (SDI). We also analysed HALE by decomposing years of life gained into years spent in good health and in poor health, between 1990 and 2017, and extra years lived by females compared with males. Findings Globally, from 1990 to 2017, life expectancy at birth increased by 7·4 years (95% uncertainty interval 7·1-7·8), from 65·6 years (65·3-65·8) in 1990 to 73·0 years (72·7-73·3) in 2017. The increase in years of life varied from 5·1 years (5·0-5·3) in high SDI countries to 12·0 years (11·3-12·8) in low SDI countries. Of the additional years of life expected at birth, 26·3% (20·1-33·1) were expected to be spent in poor health in high SDI countries compared with 11·7% (8·8-15·1) in low-middle SDI countries. HALE at birth increased by 6·3 years (5·9-6·7), from 57·0 years (54·6-59·1) in 1990 to 63·3 years (60·5-65·7) in 2017. The increase varied from 3·8 years (3·4-4·1) in high SDI countries to 10·5 years (9·8-11·2) in low SDI countries. Even larger variations in HALE than these were observed between countries, ranging from 1·0 year (0·4-1·7) in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (62·4 years [59·9-64·7] in 1990 to 63·5 years [60·9-65·8] in 2017) to 23·7 years (21·9-25·6) in Eritrea (30·7 years [28·9-32·2] in 1990 to 54·4 years [51·5-57·1] in 2017). In most countries, the increase in HALE was smaller than the increase in overall life expectancy, indicating more years lived in poor health. In 180 of 195 countries and territories, females were expected to live longer than males in 2017, with extra years lived varying from 1·4 years (0·6-2·3) in Algeria to 11·9 years (10·9-12·9) in Ukraine. Of the extra years gained, the proportion spent in poor health varied largely across countries, with less than 20% of additional years spent in poor health in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, and Slovakia, whereas in Bahrain all the extra years were spent in poor health. In 2017, the highest estimate of HALE at birth was in Singapore for both females (75·8 years [72·4-78·7]) and males (72·6 years [69·8-75·0]) and the lowest estimates were in Central African Republic (47·0 years [43·7-50·2] for females and 42·8 years [40·1-45·6] for males). Globally, in 2017, the ?ve leading causes of DALYs were neonatal disorders, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Between 1990 and 2017, age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 41·3% (38·8-43·5) for communicable diseases and by 49·8% (47·9-51·6) for neonatal disorders. For non-communicable diseases, global DALYs increased by 40·1% (36·8-43·0), although age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 18·1% (16·0-20·2). Interpretation With increasing life expectancy in most countries, the question of whether the additional years of life gained are spent in good health or poor health has been increasingly relevant because of the potential policy implications, such as health-care provisions and extending retirement ages. In some locations, a large proportion of those additional years are spent in poor health. Large inequalities in HALE and disease burden exist across countries in different SDI quintiles and between sexes. The burden of disabling conditions has serious implications for health system planning and health-related expenditures. Despite the progress made in reducing the burden of communicable diseases and neonatal disorders in low SDI countries, the speed of this progress could be increased by scaling up proven interventions. The global trends among non-communicable diseases indicate that more effort is needed to maximise HALE, such as risk prevention and attention to upstream determinants of health.;;1543;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;SPHSU13;National Institutes of Health

Goals (SDGs) highlight both great potential for and threats to improving health by 2030. To fully deliver on the SDG aim of “leaving no one behind”, it is increasingly important to examine the health-related SDGs beyond national-level estimates. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017), we measured progress on 41 of 52 health-related SDG indicators and estimated the health-related SDG index for 195 countries and territories for the period 1990–2017, projected indicators to 2030, and analysed global attainment. Methods: We measured progress on 41 health-related SDG indicators from 1990 to 2017, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2016 (new indicators were health worker density, sexual violence by non-intimate partners, population census status, and prevalence of physical and sexual violence [reported separately]). We also improved the measurement of several previously reported indicators. We constructed national-level estimates and, for a subset of health-related SDGs, examined indicator-level differences by sex and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile. We also did subnational assessments of performance for selected countries. To construct the health-related SDG index, we transformed the value for each indicator on a scale of 0–100, with 0 as the 2·5th percentile and 100 as the 97·5th percentile of 1000 draws calculated from 1990 to 2030, and took the geometric mean of the scaled indicators by target. To generate projections through 2030, we used a forecasting framework that drew estimates from the broader GBD study and used weighted averages of indicator-specific and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2017 to inform future estimates. We assessed attainment of indicators with defined targets in two ways: first, using mean values projected for 2030, and then using the probability of attainment in 2030 calculated from 1000 draws. We also did a global attainment analysis of the feasibility of attaining SDG targets on the basis of past trends. Using 2015 global averages of indicators with defined SDG targets, we calculated the global annualised rates of change required from 2015 to 2030 to meet these targets, and then identified in what percentiles the required global annualised rates of change fell in the distribution of country-level rates of change from 1990 to 2015. We took the mean of these global percentile values across indicators and applied the past rate of change at this mean global percentile to all health-related SDG indicators, irrespective of target definition, to estimate the equivalent 2030 global average value and percentage change from 2015 to 2030 for each indicator. Findings: The global median health-related SDG index in 2017 was 59·4 (IQR 35·4–67·3), ranging from a low of 11·6 (95% uncertainty interval 9·6–14·0) to a high of 84·9 (83·1–86·7). SDG index values in countries assessed at the subnational level varied substantially, particularly in China and India, although scores in Japan and the UK were more homogeneous. Indicators also varied by SDI quintile and sex, with males having worse outcomes than females for non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality, alcohol use, and smoking, among others. Most countries were projected to have a higher health-related SDG index in 2030 than in 2017, while country-level probabilities of attainment by 2030 varied widely by indicator. Under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria indicators had the most countries with at least 95% probability of target attainment. Other indicators, including NCD mortality and suicide mortality, had no countries projected to meet corresponding SDG targets on the basis of projected mean values for 2030 but showed some probability of attainment by 2030. For some indicators, including child malnutrition, several infectious diseases, and most violence measures, the annualised rates of change required to meet SDG targets far exceeded the pace of progress achieved by any country in the recent past. We found that applying the mean global annualised rate of change to indicators without defined targets would equate to about 19% and 22% reductions in global smoking and alcohol consumption, respectively; a 47% decline in adolescent birth rates; and a more than 85% increase in health worker density per 1000 population by 2030. Interpretation: The GBD study offers a unique, robust platform for monitoring the health-related SDGs across demographic and geographic dimensions. Our findings underscore the importance of increased collection and analysis of disaggregated data and highlight where more deliberate design or targeting of interventions could accelerate progress in attaining the SDGs. Current projections show that many health-related SDG indicators, NCDs, NCD-related risks, and violence-related indicators will require a concerted shift away from what might have driven past gains—curative interventions in the case of NCDs—towards multisectoral, prevention-oriented policy action and investments to achieve SDG aims. Notably, several targets, if they are to be met by 2030, demand a pace of progress that no country has achieved in the recent past. The future is fundamentally uncertain, and no model can fully predict what breakthroughs or events might alter the course of the SDGs. What is clear is that our actions—or inaction—today will ultimately dictate how close the world, collectively, can get to leaving no one behind by 2030.

November 2018;The Lancet;01406736;16590;1474547X;Journal;392;10159;;1736-1788;"Background: Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017. Methods: The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502 cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional countries—Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation. We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD, including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location, year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous versions, GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here are age-standardised. Findings: At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to 73·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 72·5–74·1) of total deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18·6% (17·9–19·6), and injuries 8·0% (7·7–8·2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22·7% (21·5–23·9), representing an additional 7·61 million (7·20–8·01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from NCDs decreased globally by 7·9% (7·0–8·8). The number of deaths for CMNN causes decreased by 22·2% (20·0–24·0) and the death rate by 31·8% (30·1–33·3). Total deaths from injuries increased by 2·3% (0·5–4·0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from injuries decreased by 13·7% (12·2–15·1) to 57·9 deaths (55·9–59·2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268 000–289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000–363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and terrorism increased by 118·0% (88·8–148·6). A greater reduction in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, such as a 36·4% (32·2–40·6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years compared with a 33·6% (31·2–36·1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an epidemiological transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990—neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases—were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases. Interpretation: Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health. For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for selected causes has increased in the past decade.

Department of Economics and Social Afairs (UNPOP), the United States Census Bureau, WHO, and as part of previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). Previous iterations of the GBD used population estimates from UNPOP, which were not derived in a way that was internally consistent with the estimates of the numbers of deaths in the GBD. The present iteration of the GBD, GBD 2017, improves on previous assessments and provides timely estimates of the mortality experience of populations globally. Methods: The GBD uses all available data to produce estimates of mortality rates between 1950 and 2017 for 23 age groups, both sexes, and 918 locations, including 195 countries and territories and subnational locations for 16 countries. Data used include vital registration systems, sample registration systems, household surveys (complete birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household deaths), and Demographic Surveillance Sites. In total, this analysis used 8259 data sources. Estimates of the probability of death between birth and the age of 5 years and between ages 15 and 60 years are generated and then input into a model life table system to produce complete life tables for all locations and years. Fatal discontinuities and mortality due to HIV/AIDS are analysed separately and then incorporated into the estimation. We analyse the relationship between age-specifc mortality and development status using the Socio-demographic Index, a composite measure based on fertility under the age of 25 years, education, and income. There are four main methodological improvements in GBD 2017 compared with GBD 2016: 622 additional data sources have been incorporated; new estimates of population, generated by the GBD study, are used; statistical methods used in diferent components of the analysis have been further standardised and improved; and the analysis has been extended backwards in time by two decades to start in 1950. Findings: Globally, 18·7% (95% uncertainty interval 18·4-19·0) of deaths were registered in 1950 and that proportion has been steadily increasing since, with 58·8% (58·2-59·3) of all deaths being registered in 2015. At the global level, between 1950 and 2017, life expectancy increased from 48·1 years (46·5-49·6) to 70·5 years (70·1-70·8) for men and from 52·9 years (51·7-54·0) to 75·6 years (75·3-75·9) for women. Despite this overall progress, there remains substantial variation in life expectancy at birth in 2017, which ranges from 49·1 years (46·5-51·7) for men in the Central African Republic to 87·6 years (86·9-88·1) among women in Singapore. The greatest progress across age groups was for children younger than 5 years; under-5 mortality dropped from 216·0 deaths (196·3-238·1) per 1000 livebirths in 1950 to 38·9 deaths (35·6-42·83) per 1000 livebirths in 2017, with huge reductions across countries. Nevertheless, there were still 5·4 million (5·2-5·6) deaths among children younger than 5 years in the world in 2017. Progress has been less pronounced and more variable for adults, especially for adult males, who had stagnant or increasing mortality rates in several countries. The gap between male and female life expectancy between 1950 and 2017, while relatively stable at the global level, shows distinctive patterns across super-regions and has consistently been the largest in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and smallest in south Asia. Performance was also variable across countries and time in observed mortality rates compared with those expected on the basis of development. Interpretation: This analysis of age-sex-specifc mortality shows that there are remarkably complex patterns in population mortality across countries. The fndings of this study highlight global successes, such as the large decline in under-5 mortality, which refects signifcant local, national, and global commitment and investment over several decades. However, they also bring attention to mortality patterns that are a cause for concern, particularly among adult men and, to a lesser extent, women, whose mortality rates have stagnated in many countries over the time period of this study, and in some cases are increasing.";;511;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;R01MH110163;National Institutes of Health

November 2018;The Lancet;01406736;16590;1474547X;Journal;392;10159;;1995-2051;"Background: Population estimates underpin demographic and epidemiological research and are used to track progress on numerous international indicators of health and development. To date, internationally available estimates of population and fertility, although useful, have not been produced with transparent and replicable methods and do not use standardised estimates of mortality. We present single-calendar year and single-year of age estimates of fertility and population by sex with standardised and replicable methods. Methods: We estimated population in 195 locations by single year of age and single calendar year from 1950 to 2017 with standardised and replicable methods. We based the estimates on the demographic balancing equation, with inputs of fertility, mortality, population, and migration data. Fertility data came from 7817 location-years of vital registration data, 429 surveys reporting complete birth histories, and 977 surveys and censuses reporting summary birth histories. We estimated age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs; the annual number of livebirths to women of a specified age group per 1000 women in that age group) by use of spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and used the ASFRs to estimate total fertility rates (TFRs; the average number of children a woman would bear if she survived through the end of the reproductive age span [age 10–54 years] and experienced at each age a particular set of ASFRs observed in the year of interest). Because of sparse data, fertility at ages 10–14 years and 50–54 years was estimated from data on fertility in women aged 15–19 years and 45–49 years, through use of linear regression. Age-specific mortality data came from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 estimates. Data on population came from 1257 censuses and 761 population registry location-years and were adjusted for underenumeration and age misreporting with standard demographic methods. Migration was estimated with the GBD Bayesian demographic balancing model, after incorporating information about refugee migration into the model prior. Final population estimates used the cohort-component method of population projection, with inputs of fertility, mortality, and migration data. Population uncertainty was estimated by use of out-of-sample predictive validity testing. With these data, we estimated the trends in population by age and sex and in fertility by age between 1950 and 2017 in 195 countries and territories. Findings: From 1950 to 2017, TFRs decreased by 49·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 46·4–52·0). The TFR decreased from 4·7 livebirths (4·5–4·9) to 2·4 livebirths (2·2–2·5), and the ASFR of mothers aged 10–19 years decreased from 37 livebirths (34–40) to 22 livebirths (19–24) per 1000 women. Despite reductions in the TFR, the global population has been increasing by an average of 83·8 million people per year since 1985. The global population increased by 197·2% (193·3–200·8) since 1950, from 2·6 billion (2·5–2·6) to 7·6 billion (7·4–7·9) people in 2017; much of this increase was in the proportion of the global population in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The global annual rate of population growth increased between 1950 and 1964, when it peaked at 2·0%; this rate then remained nearly constant until 1970 and then decreased to 1·1% in 2017. Population growth rates in the southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania GBD super-region decreased from 2·5% in 1963 to 0·7% in 2017, whereas in sub-Saharan Africa, population growth rates were almost at the highest reported levels ever in 2017, when they were at 2·7%. The global average age increased from 26·6 years in 1950 to 32·1 years in 2017, and the proportion of the population that is of working age (age 15–64 years) increased from 59·9% to 65·3%. At the national level, the TFR decreased in all countries and territories between 1950 and 2017; in 2017, TFRs ranged from a low of 1·0 livebirths (95% UI 0·9–1·2) in Cyprus to a high of 7·1 livebirths (6·8–7·4) in Niger. The TFR under age 25 years (TFU25; number of livebirths expected by age 25 years for a hypothetical woman who survived the age group and was exposed to current ASFRs) in 2017 ranged from 0·08 livebirths (0·07–0·09) in South Korea to 2·4 livebirths (2·2–2·6) in Niger, and the TFR over age 30 years (TFO30; number of livebirths expected for a hypothetical woman ageing from 30 to 54 years who survived the age group and was exposed to current ASFRs) ranged from a low of 0·3 livebirths (0·3–0·4) in Puerto Rico to a high of 3·1 livebirths (3·0–3·2) in Niger. TFO30 was higher than TFU25 in 145 countries and territories in 2017. 33 countries had a negative population growth rate from 2010 to 2017, most of which were located in central, eastern, and western Europe, whereas population growth rates of more than 2·0% were seen in 33 of 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, less than 65% of the national population was of working age in 12 of 34 high-income countries, and less than 50% of the national population was of working age in Mali, Chad, and Niger. Interpretation: Population trends create demographic dividends and headwinds (ie, economic benefits and detriments) that affect national economies and determine national planning needs. Although TFRs are decreasing, the global population continues to grow as mortality declines, with diverse patterns at the national level and across age groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide transparent and replicable estimates of population and fertility, which can be used to inform decision making and to monitor progress.

Twenty seven OI patients (21 women, 6 men) and 26 age-matched healthy subjects (13 women, 13 men) were enrolled in a 70° HUT test. In addition to hemodynamic variables, cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were determined using linear and nonlinear methods to analyze heart rate (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV). During the complete test, HRV was lower in healthy men than in female controls. Decreased HRV and increased BPV were observed in female patients compared to healthy women. Furthermore, systolic BPV was increased in male and female patients. However, linear (rmssd) and nonlinear (plvar2) parameters indicated that diastolic BPV decreased in male patients during orthostatic phase, but remained unchanged in female patients. Findings indicated gender dependent mechanisms for the regulation of diastolic blood pressure during orthostatic stress in patients.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

Growth parameters, glucose uptake, percentage of removal efficiency (%E) of DBP, biodegradation constant of DBP (k) and half-life of DBP biodegradation (t1/2) were evaluated for Pleurotus ostreatus grown on media containing glucose and different concentrations of DBP (0, 500 and 1000 mg l−1). P. ostreatus degraded 99.6 % and 94 % of 500 and 1000 mg of DBP l−1 after 312 h and 504 h, respectively. The k was 0.0155 h−1 and 0.0043 h−1 for 500 and 1000 mg of DBP l−1, respectively. t1/2 was 44.7 h and 161 h for 500 and 1000 mg of DBP l−1, respectively. Intermediate compounds of biodegraded DBP were identified by GC-MS and a DBP biodegradation pathway was proposed using quantum chemical calculation. DBP might be metabolized to benzene and acetyl acetate, the first would be oxidated to muconic acid and the latter would enter into the Krebs cycle.

The adult stage of Pelecitus has been reported infecting birds, and the microfilaria has been associated to human blindness. However, in some of these cases, the nematode was incompletely identified at the species level due to the scarcity of morphological taxonomic keys and, also, to the lack of molecular diagnostic analysis. Here, we report a new Pelecitus species in a crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) producing a severe tenosynovitis and microfilarial dermatitis. It is also the first record of Pelecitus in an American bird of prey.

Here, we uncovered a miR-204 cooperative targeting of multiple signaling transducers involved in vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Our data showed that invasive triple negative MDA-MB-231 and Hs-578T breast cancer cells, but not poorly invasive MCF-7 cells, efficiently undergoes matrix-associated VM under hypoxia. Ectopic restoration of miR-204 in MDA-MB-231 cells leads to a potent inhibition of VM and reduction of number of branch points and patterned 3D channels. Further analysis of activation state of multiple signaling pathways using Phosphorylation Antibody Arrays revealed that miR-204 reduced the expression and phosphorylation levels of 13 proteins involved in PI3K/AKT, RAF1/MAPK, VEGF, and FAK/SRC signaling. In agreement with phospho-proteomic profiling, VM was impaired following pharmacological administration of PI3K and SRC inhibitors. Mechanistic studies confirmed that miR-204 exerts a negative post-transcriptional regulation of PI3K-α and c-SRC proto-oncogenes. Moreover, overall survival analysis of a large cohort of breast cancer patients indicates that low miR-204 and high FAK/SRC levels were associated with worst outcomes. In conclusion, our study provides novel lines of evidence indicating that miR-204 may exerts a fine-tuning regulation of the synergistic transduction of PI3K/AKT/FAK mediators critical in VM formation.;Breast cancer | miR-204 | Phospho-proteomics | Signaling pathways | Vasculogenic mimicry;28;0;;;UNAM;222335;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

Among them, there is a large range of classical algorithms (e.g. spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering and Bayesian-based enhancement), and more recently several deep neural network-based. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to speech enhancement which combines two stages: In the first stage, the well-known Wiener filter performs the task of enhancing noisy speech. In the second stage, a refinement is performed using a new multi-stream approach, which involves a collection of denoising autoencoders and auto-associative memories based on Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks. We carry out a comparative performance analysis using two objective measures, using artificial noise added at different signal-to-noise levels. Results show that this hybrid system improves the signal's enhancement significantly in comparison to the Wiener filtering and the LSTM networks separately.;Deep learning | Denoising autoencoders | LSTM | Signal processing;10;0;;;SEP;182432;Secretaría de Educación Pública

From the time-frequency spectra of R-R intervals (RR), respiration (Res), systolic (SP) and diastolic pressures (DP) series, their instantaneous low-frequency (LFRR, LFSP, LFDP) and high-frequency (HFRR, HFRes) powers were estimated to compute, by alpha index, BRS and RSAS, as well as their time-frequency coherences. Relations of %MF with BRS, cBRS, RSAS and cRSAS were inverse, and those with heart rate (HR), DP and HFRes, were direct, all but RSAS with greater slopes and correlations in LE than HG. RSAS can be computed analogously to BRS by alpha index, and their coherences can be used as complementary measures of the degree of their input-output coupling. Performing HG and LE in a LIF format provokes moderately to strongly correlated effects, greater for LE than HG, consisting in progressive vagal withdrawal with loss of respiratory-cardiac modulation and release of sympathetic activity that cause the parallel increases of DP and HR with increasing regularity, greater for LE than HG.;;2;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Obesity is a worldwide epidemic problem, described as a risk factor for hepatic diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and other pathologies related to development of cholesterol crystals and cholesterol gallbladder stones. It has been reported that cholesterol overload may cause hepatic damage; however, little is known about the effects of an acute hypercholesterolemic diet on the gallbladder. The aim of this manuscript was to evaluate the impact of a cholesterol-rich diet on the gallbladder. Material and methods. The study included ten eight-week-old C57BL6 male mice, which were divided into two study groups and fed different diets for 48 h: a hypercholesterolemic diet and a balanced Chow diet. After 48 h, the mice were analyzed by US with a Siemens Acuson Antares equipment. Mice were subsequently sacrificed to carry out a cholesterol analysis with a Reflo-ton System (Roche), a crystal analysis with a Carl Zeiss microscope with polarized light, and a histological analysis with Hematoxylin-eosin staining. Results. The hypercholesterolemic diet induced an increase in gallbladder size and total cholesterol content in the bile, along with important histological changes. Conclusion. Cholesterol overloads not only trigger hepatic damage, but also affect the gallbladder significantly.";Bile | Cholesterol | Histopathology | Lithiasis | Ultrasound;1;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;NIH;undefined;National Institutes of Health

It has been observed experimentally that subpopulations of cortical mitochondria and ER associate to secretory sites in bovine chromaffin cells. Here, we study the effect of the geometrical distribution of the co-localized cortical organelles both in the formation of HCMDs in the vicinity of Ca 2+ channels and on the secretory activity of bovine chromaffin cells in response to a single voltage pulse. Our simulations indicate that co-localized organelles have a dual role in the formation of HCMDs, having, on the one hand, an amplification effect due to the Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ -release mechanism from the ER and, on the other, acting as physical barriers to Ca 2+ diffusion. In addition, our simulations suggest that the increased levels of Ca 2+ in the microdomain enhances the secretion of the vesicles co-localized to the Ca 2+ channels. As a whole, our results support the idea that the functional triads formed by Ca 2+ channels, subplasmalemma ER and mitochondria have a positive effect on the secretion of catecholamines in bovine chromaffin cells.;Calcium stores | Chromaffin cells | Modeling of exocytosis | Particle-based methods;3;0;;;CONACYT;BFU2015-63684-P;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

There are few studies on the alterations in filiform papillae in CTAD. Thus, the objective of this work was to determine whether there are changes in the macroscopic and dermoscopic patterns of filiform papillae. Methods: This case–control study included patients who were diagnosed with CTAD. The dependent variable was the dermoscopic pattern of filiform papillae of the tongue, and the independent variables were age, gender, time of evolution, and current treatment. A photograph of the back of the tongue was taken, and subsequently, the same site was examined by dermatoscopy. The microscopic and dermoscopic patterns of filiform papillae were classified (Maeda). Results: We included 50 cases and 50 controls, 94% of whom were female. The mean age was 43.96 ± 14.65 years. Of the cases with CTAD, 25% presented with a normal macroscopic pattern, versus 36% (18) with pattern II, 12% (6) with pattern III, and 20% (10) with pattern IV. The dermoscopic pattern was type I in 23 cases (46%), type II in 16 (32%), type III in 10 (20%), and type IV in one patient (2%). Conclusions: We have noted alterations in filiform papillae in CTADs, which emphasizes the importance of a detailed intraoral exploration and the macroscopic and dermoscopic evaluation of the dorsum of the tongue, specifically the filiform papillae.";;5;0;;;;undefined;

In this study, a total of 8,126 serum samples were obtained from 275 technified and semi-technified farms belonging to 30 of the 32 states of Mexico and representative of the eight regions of the country. Anti-PRRSv antibodies against the PRRS vaccine and an isolated wild Mexican virus were tested by ELISA. Antibodies were found in 15%–49% of the tested sera, with 2.4%–9.8% against the vaccine and 7.7%–26% against the wild virus. The PRRSv virus was detected by RT-PCR in 77 of the 1,630 pooled samples tested, representing seven of the eight geographic regions into which the Mexican Republic is divided. The complete sequences of open reading frames 5 and 7 from 20 PRRSv-positive samples were determined. The analysis of the sequences together with the previously published sequences of historic strains revealed that all the strains belonged to the one, five and eight lineages of the PRRSV2. Striking differences, particularly in ORF5 and ORF7, were found between sequences of the strains and the reference virus, due to insertions and substitutions in positions that play key roles in the recognition, structure and function of the virus. Overall, these results established the magnitude of PRRS virus genetic diversity, and the most frequent virus strain that predominates in Mexico.

The present study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms of two pathways to cancer transformation with the purpose of identifying potential biomarkers. Our approach is based on a meta-analysis of gene expression profiling contrasting two scenarios: A model that describes a transformation pathway from melanocyte to melanoma and a second model where transformation occurs through an intermediary nevus. Data consists of three independent, publicly available microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database comprising samples from melanocytes, nevi and melanoma. The present analysis identified 808 differentially expressed genes (528 upregulated and 360 downregulated) in melanoma compared with nevi, and 2,331 differentially expressed genes (946 upregulated and 1,385 downregulated) in melanoma compared with melanocytes. Further analysis narrowed down this list, since 682 differentially expressed genes were found in both models (417 upregulated and 265 downregulated). Enrichment analysis identified relevant dysregulated pathways. This article also presented a discussion on significant genes including ADAM like decysin 1, neudesin neurotrophic factor, MMP19, apolipoprotein L6, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)8, basic, immunoglobulin-like variable motif containing and CXCL16. These are of particular interest because they encode secreted proteins hence represent potential blood biomarkers for the early detection of malignant transformation in both scenarios. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, an important therapeutic target in melanoma treatment, was also upregulated in both comparisons indicating a potential involvement in immune tolerance, not only at advanced stages but also during the early transformation to melanoma. The results of the present study may provide a research direction for studying the mechanisms underlying the development of melanoma, depending on its origin.;Biomarker | Melanocyte | Melanoma | Meta-analysis | Nevus | Transcriptome;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;181534;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The occurrence of adverse reactions (ADRs) to CBZ can negatively impact the quality of life of patients, as well as increase health-care costs. Thus, knowledge of CBZ-induced ADRs is important to achieve safer treatment outcomes. Areas covered: This review describes the clinical features, known mechanisms, and clinical management of the main CBZ-induced ADRs. In addition, pharmacogenetic studies focused on ADRs induced by CBZ are cited. Expert commentary: CBZ-induced ADRs are well known in the literature. The metabolite CBZ-10,11-epoxide plays an important role in the mechanism that underlies the ADRs induced by CBZ. Several factors should be considered for a safer use of CBZ, such as monotherapy prescription when possible, an adequate dose titration, knowledge of previous ADRs in the patient, and routine monitoring of CBZ plasma concentrations in symptomatic patients. Pharmacogenetics is a potential tool for CBZ therapy improvement, and the design of multicenter studies focused on the identification of biomarkers for CBZ-induced ADRs could provide useful information for a safer CBZ therapy.;Adverse drug reactions | carbamazepine | hepatotoxicity | hypersensitivity | hyponatremia | Stevens-Johnson syndrome | teratogenesis | toxic epidermal necrolysis;36;0;;;FONACYT;167261;Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Methods: This is an ambispective descriptive longitudinal study of the evolution of visual acuity and development, using Teller Acuity Cards, Retinoscopy, and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third edition. Eight patients with BCC were included to establish the general conditions of onset with longitudinal follow-up after surgery. Patients were divided into two groups, considering the age of treatment (early treatment < 6 months; late treatment > 6 months). We used non-parametric statistics with trend tests in the two groups, using a significance level of p < 0.05. A description of visual development was made through a qualitative analysis. Results: Refractive errors decreased progressively, with a statistically significant difference between both groups (p < 0.01). The cognitive area showed improved outcomes with a significant difference (p = 0.012) in the early treatment group. Conclusions: Late surgical treatment led to severe disturbances in the organization of visual function, as well as in observable behaviors of the motor, cognitive, and language areas, limiting a comprehensive and adequate development of children. It is necessary to implement strategies that include visual rehabilitation and early intervention for developmental disturbances.";Amblyopia | Congenital cataract | Development | Visual deprivation | Visual function;1;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Understanding the factors that determine the FAR increase in the agricultural sector is important due to the benefits that can be obtained when an increase in productivity occurs. The results indicate that during the 2011-2013 period the average FAR was 64.7%, which indicates that 35.3% of the surface sown in the country does not make use of chemical fertilizers. The model results indicate the existence of a positive relationship between the FAR and the size of the plot, the producers' income, the direct PROCAMPO payment, the number of tractors, and the level of education of the rural population. The model also shows the existence of a negative relationship between the FAR and the fertilizer prices, the improved seed and the pesticides. If the size of the plot and the income per hectare increase in 5%, then the FAR increases in 0.3 and 1.6%, respectively. A decrease of 5% in the fertilizer price would increase the FAR in 3.7%. Facing a simultaneous decrease of 5% in the prices of fertilizer, improved seed and pesticides, the FAR would increase in 6.1%. These results demonstrate the importance of agricultural inputs as a source of growth in the productivity.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

A total of 16 female patients and 12 age-matched healthy female subjects were enrolled in a passive 70° head-up tilt test. Also, 12 age-matched healthy male subjects were enrolled to study gender differences. Analysis was performed dynamically using various short-term (5 min) windows shifted by 1 min as well as by 20 min of orthostatic phase (OP) to evaluate local and global complexity. Complexity was determined over multiple time scales by the established method of refined composite multiscale entropy (RCMSE) and by a new proposed method of multiscale entropy based on symbolic dynamics (MSE-SD). Concerning heart rate variability (HRV) during OP, both methods revealed the highest complexity for female controls followed by lower complexity in male controls (p < 0.01) and by the lowest complexity in female patients (p < 0.01). For blood pressure variability (BPV), no gender differences in controls were shown by any method. However, MSE-SD demonstrated highly significantly increased BPV complexity in patients during OP (p < 0.01 on 4 time-scales after 7 min, p < 0.001 on 5 time-scales after 11 min) while RCMSE did not reveal considerable differences (p < 0.05 on 2 time scales after 7 min). Respiratory complexity was further increased in patients primary shown by MSE-SD. Findings indicated impaired autonomic regulation in VVS patients characterized by predominantly increased BPV complexity accompanied with decreased HRV complexity. In addition, results suggested extending the concept of complexity loss with disease.;Cardiovascular complexity | multiscale entropy | orthostatic stress | symbolic dynamics | vasovagal syncope;12;0;;;;undefined;

health care. Examining where gains have occurred or progress has faltered across and within countries is crucial to guiding decisions and strategies for future improvement. We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to assess personal health-care access and quality with the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index for 195 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in seven countries, from 1990 to 2016. Methods Drawing from established methods and updated estimates from GBD 2016, we used 32 causes from which death should not occur in the presence of effective care to approximate personal health-care access and quality by location and over time. To better isolate potential effects of personal health-care access and quality from underlying risk factor patterns, we risk-standardised cause-specific deaths due to non-cancers by location-year, replacing the local joint exposure of environmental and behavioural risks with the global level of exposure. Supported by the expansion of cancer registry data in GBD 2016, we used mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers instead of risk-standardised death rates to provide a stronger signal of the effects of personal health care and access on cancer survival. We transformed each cause to a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the first percentile (worst) observed between 1990 and 2016, and 100 as the 99th percentile (best); we set these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to subnational locations. We applied a principal components analysis to construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, providing an overall score of 0-100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time. We then compared HAQ Index levels and trends by quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of overall development. As derived from the broader GBD study and other data sources, we examined relationships between national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health spending per capita. Findings In 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97·1 (95% UI 95·8-98·1) in Iceland, followed by 96·6 (94·9-97·9) in Norway and 96·1 (94·5-97·3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18·6 (13·1-24·4) in the Central African Republic, 19·0 (14·3-23·7) in Somalia, and 23·4 (20·2-26·8) in Guinea-Bissau. The pace of progress achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements occurring between 2000 and 2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91·5 (89·1-93·6) in Beijing to 48·0 (43·4-53·2) in Tibet (a 43·5-point difference), while India saw a 30·8-point disparity, from 64·8 (59·6-68·8) in Goa to 34·0 (30·3-38·1) in Assam. Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4·8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high for England. State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20·9-point to 17·0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17·2-point to 20·4-point difference). Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases. Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases. Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries. Interpretation GBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access and quality worldwide. Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle- SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases. Stagnating or minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium Development Goals. Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage hinges upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive view - and subsequent provision - of quality health care for all populations.";;467;1;repositoryam;Green;BMGF;CD15/00019;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

Ameloblastomas are odontogenic tumors distinguished as invasive and infiltrative neoplasms and are divided into different histological types, the most common of which are the unicystic ameloblastoma and the conventional ameloblastoma. The aim of this study was to identify the presence of two proteoglycans, perlecan and biglycan, in different types of ameloblastoma. Using immunohistochemistry, we determined the presence of both proteins in 28 unicystic ameloblastomas and 23 conventional ameloblastomas. We identified the cytoplasmic and nuclear presence of perlecan and the cytoplasmic presence of biglycan in both types of ameloblastoma. The mean values of immunoexpression were higher in the conventional type compared to the unicystic type. Neither the presence of biglycan in ameloblastomas nor the nuclear presence of perlecan in any odontogenic tumor has previously been reported. The differential immunoexpression of perlecan and biglycan in these types of ameloblastomas suggests their participation in the developmental process of these tumors.";Ameloblastoma | Biglycan | Perlecan;0;0;;;;undefined;

To this end, a total of 1,438 equine were utilized, after classification into six groups, as follows: mules, donkeys, culled horses, charrería horses (Mexican rodeo horses), foals, and ponies. The time intervals evaluated were 1 and 5 h. During the study, the animals received only water ad libitum. The physiological blood indicators assessed were: PvCO2 (mm Hg) and PvO2 (mm Hg) pressure, pH, glucose (mg/dL), lactate (mg/dL), bicarbonate levels (mmol/L), hematocrit (%), Na+, K+ and Ca2+ (mmol/L). The animals that presented the most marked physiological alterations were the mules and donkeys. The mules that remained in the corrals for 1 h presented increases (P < 0.0001) in the values for pO2 glucose, hematocrit and blood pH, compared to reference values (RV), while the donkeys had increases (P < 0.0001) in glucose and hematocrit values. By the end of the first hour at the exhibition corrals the equine were dehydrated, suffered fatigue, and suffered metabolic and compensatory problems, probably due to the combined effects of a series of factors that include transport and inadequate handling.;Animal welfare | Equine | Glucose | Lactate | Livestock market;9;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Little is known about the relationship between GIS and malnutrition in geriatric patients with ESRD. The main objective of this study was to determine the relationship between nutritional status and severity of GIS in geriatric patients on dialysis therapy. Clinically-stable geriatric patients (older than 60 years old) who were dialysis outpatients were included in this cross-sectional study. The severity of GIS was assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire (GSQ, short version), with patients classified into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe. Nutritional status was evaluated with the Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS), anthropometric assessment, biochemical parameters, and bioelectrical impedance. Descriptive statistics were used and differences between groups were analyzed with ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis, with a p < 0.05 considered to indicate significance. Fifty patients completed the study; the median age was 67 years old. Twenty-three patients were on hemodialysis (HD) and 27 were on peritoneal dialysis (PD). No significant differences were found according to dialysis modality, presence of diabetes, or gender. Ninety percent of patients had at least one GIS. Poorer nutritional status (evaluated by MIS) was related to a higher severity of GIS. There were no significant differences with other nutritional parameters. Our study showed a high prevalence of GIS in geriatric patients. There were no differences in observed GIS values that were attributed to dialysis modality, gender, or presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Severe GIS values were associated with poorer nutritional status determined by MIS, however, there was no association with anthropometry, biochemical values, or bioimpedance vector analysis.";Dialytic therapy | Gastrointestinal symptoms | Geriatric patients | Nutritional status;10;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In this study, we sought to determine the incidence, persistence and clearance of HPV infections in oral and oropharyngeal samples from HIV/AIDS subjects. Methods: A longitudinal, observational and analytical study was performed with an ongoing cohort of HIV/AIDS subjects in Mexico City (September 2013-February 2015). The study was approved by institutional committees, and demographic and clinical data were registered. At the baseline and three-month visits, oral examinations and cytobrush samples were obtained. DNA was purified, quantified and used to detect an HPV-L1 gene fragment by nested PCR, using MY09/MY11 and GP5 + /GP6 + primers. HPV DNA products were purified, sequenced and typed according to HPV databases. Risk factors were assessed, and a multivariate modelling approach was used to determine independent effects. Results: This study included 97 HIV/AIDS individuals (91% men [86.4% of which are men who have sex with men], median age: 36 years, 72.2% under HAART). From the baseline visit, HPV was observed in 55.7% (HR-HPV: 26.8%; HPV-18: 24.1%), with a higher HPV-positive samples for smokers (61.1 vs 32.6%, P =.005). The three-month overall HPV incidence was 33.9%; type-specific HPV persistence was 33.3% (HR-HPV: 13.3%); and 13 of the 33 (39.4%) baseline HPV-positive individuals cleared the infection (HR-HPV: 53.8%). Conclusions: Although HR-HPV persistence was low, and clearance of the infection was observed in most cases, a close follow-up is necessary, given the increase in HNC among HIV-subjects, particularly HPV-related cancer.";HIV/AIDS | human papillomavirus | oral cancer | persistence | tobacco;5;0;;;;undefined;

During CT, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are upregulated, causing damage in mucosal and submucosal tissues, and playing a key role in OM; therefore, the use of subantimicrobial doxycycline as a MMP inhibitor may represent a potential approach for OM management. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low doses of doxycycline in OM development in individuals with acute leukaemia (AL) during CT. Methods: Randomized controlled clinical trial (Registration No. NCT01087476) performed in adult AL patients scheduled to receive CT (September 2010-October 2014). Individuals were stratified by leukaemia type and assigned randomly to receive doxycycline hyclate (50 mg/d) (doxycycline group: DG) or placebo (placebo group: PG) before and during CT. Included subjects had a baseline oral examination and thereafter 3 times a week during 21 days. The primary outcome was OM development. Results and discussion: One hundred and forty-seven AL subjects were enrolled: 74 in DG and 73 in PG; baseline characteristics between groups were comparable. During follow-up, 15 (10.2%) individuals developed OM; no differences between treatment groups were found (DG:8.1%, PG:12.3%; P =.59). The mean OM Assessment Scale score was 2.51, without differences between groups (DG:2.7, PG:2.4; P =.65). Low baseline blood albumin levels in the OM-affected individuals were identified, revealing the effect of systemic deterioration as a predisposing factor for OM development. No adverse effects were observed. What is new and conclusion: Subantimicrobial doses of doxycycline did not reduce the incidence, onset, duration or severity of OM.";chemotherapy | doxycycline | matrix metalloproteinases | oral mucositis;3;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The most studied MMRPs are hMSH2 and hMLH1, which are known to be highly expressed in normal tissues. A loss of MMRPs leads to the accumulation of DNA replication errors in proliferating cells. Ki-67 is a biomarker regarded to be the gold-standard tool for determining cell proliferation by immunohistochemical methods. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of hMLH1, hMSH2 and Ki-67 proteins in ameloblastomas and tooth germs, to contribute to the understanding of the development of this odontogenic neoplasm. Material and Methods: Immunohistochemical assays to determine the presence of proteins hMSH2, hMLH1 and Ki-67 were performed in 80 ameloblastomas (40 solid and 40 unicystic) and five tooth germs. Results: Unicystic ameloblastomas showed higher MMRP expression (hMLH1: 62.5 ± 43.4; hMSH2: 83.3 ± 47.8) than did solid ameloblastomas (hMLH1: 59.4 ± 13.5; hMSH2: 75.8 ± 40.2). Additionally, the cell proliferation index assessed by Ki-67 was inversely proportional to the expression of MMRP. Comparison between tooth germs and ameloblastoma revealed significantly higher expression of hMLH1, hMSH2 and Ki-67 in tooth germs (p=0.02). Conclusions: The differences of MMRP and Ki-67 immunoexpression between ameloblastomas and tooth germ suggest that alterations in the MMRP mechanisms could participate in the biological behavior of ameloblastomas.";Ameloblastomas | HMLH1 | HMSH2 | Ki-67 | Tooth germs;3;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Such a perspective overlooks that the spectral power time series present spontaneous oscillations, the dynamics of which have been associated with the state of health and could be also linked to superior processes such as attention, memory, or cognition. In this work, amplitude of the ERP has been associated with dynamics of the power spectral density (PSD) time series. Approach: Data from a public P3 speller database were analyzed. Statistics about latency, amplitude and scalp distribution of the ERP confirm correct task realization. The spectral power over alpha, beta and gamma bands were correlated with ERP amplitude, considering such estimations time-locked with stimuli presentation. Additionally, PSD time series over the same bands were constructed using a sliding window not synced with stimulation. From these time series, a scaling exponent was computed using a detrended fluctuation analysis approach, and such indices were correlated with ERP amplitude of all registered electrodes. Main results: The correlation between ERP amplitude and scaling exponents of PSD series achieve statistical significance in almost all channels and for all analyzed bands (excepting alpha at C4). In particular, beta and gamma PSD series achieve R2 values above 0.6 for Cz. Meanwhile, the correlation analysis with time-locked PSD achieves a statistically significant relationship with ERP amplitude () but with a coefficient of determination (R2) below 0.2, only for gamma and alpha over the C4 and Pz channels. Significance: The ERP amplitude and scaling exponent of the PSD time series show an anticorrelated behavior, suggesting that larger ERP amplitudes are elicited when the PSD series are less autocorrelated, similar to white noise, further suggesting that the processes involved in the generation of such dynamics could be related to the mechanisms of cognitive responses.;BCI | detrended fluctuation analysis | EEG | event related potentials | power spectral density time series | scaling exponent;2;0;;;;undefined;

This study aims at examining the determinants of plasma folate and vitamin B12 concentrations, considering lifestyle factors and MTHFR polymorphisms. Methods: A total of 988 women aged 40–65 years from the French E3N cohort were investigated. Intakes of folate and vitamin B12 were assessed using food frequency questionnaires, and plasma concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. Dietary scores were computed to summarize folate and vitamin B12 dietary sources. MTHFR-C677T and MTHFR-A1298C were determined by Kaspar assay. Pearson’s partial correlation coefficients and multivariable linear regression models were used to assess correlations between main determinants and plasma folate and vitamin B12 levels. Results: The partial correlation coefficient between dietary intakes and plasma folate was 0.19 (p value OpenSPiltSPi0.001) and 0.08 (p value = 0.008) for vitamin B12. Dietary scores were the main determinant of B vitamin plasma concentrations with a percent change per unit increase of 12.64% (p value OpenSPiltSPi0.001) for folate and 7.6% (p value OpenSPiltSPi0.001) for vitamin B12. Homozygous (T/T) or heterozygous (C/T) women for MTHFR-C677T had lower plasma folate concentrations [C/T: −6.48% (p value = 0.038) and T/T: −15.89% (p value OpenSPiltSPi0.001)] compared to women carrying the C/C genotype. Other determinants of B vitamin plasma concentration include: smoking status for folate, and age and hormone replacement therapy for vitamin B12. Conclusions: We confirmed previous findings on the role of diet as main determinant of folate and vitamin B12 plasma concentrations. However, the impact of genetic polymorphisms and lifestyle factors on plasma B vitamin concentrations should not be neglected.;Biomarkers | Dietary intake | Folate | MTHFR polymorphisms | Vitamin B12;11;0;;;HFCR;undefined;Hope Funds for Cancer Research

However, its activity profile may involve effects on excitatory and/or inhibitory neurotransmission since the primary target of LEV, synaptic vesicle protein 2A, is ubiquitously expressed in all types of synaptic vesicles. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to explore the effect of LEV (300 mg/kg/day for one week, administered via osmotic mini-pumps) on neurotransmitter release and its probable selective effect on extracellular gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), aspartate (Asp), glutamine (Gln), taurine (Tau) and glycine (Gly) concentrations (using in vivo microdialysis under basal and high-K+ conditions) in the dorsal hippocampus (DH), a region that undergoes major synaptic changes during epilepsy. Epileptic rats developed clear signs of hyperexcitability, i.e., an elevated Glu/GABA ratio in the DH. The LEV concentration in blood after 7 days of treatment was within the therapeutic range. In contrast, LEV was not detected four days after mini-pump removal (washout period). Furthermore, LEV restored the Glu/GABA ratio to approximately the control level and significantly increased the GABA concentration after the initiation of high-K+ conditions. Based on these data, LEV treatment restored the lost balance between the excitatory and inhibitory systems under basal conditions.

Recently, however, there is growing evidence about crucial requirement of neuron membrane cholesterol in the organization and function of the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor. For this, low cholesterol level has been reported to be associated with depression and suicidality. However there have been inconsistent reports about this finding and the exact relationship between these factors remains controversial. Therefore, we investigated the link between serum cholesterol and its fractions with depression disorder and suicide attempt in 467 adult subjects in Mexican mestizo population. Methods: Plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) were determined in 261 MDD patients meeting the DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD), 59 of whom had undergone an episode of suicide attempt, and 206 healthy controls. Results: A significant decrease in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels was observed in the groups of MDD patients and suicide attempt compared to those without suicidal behavior (p < 0.05). After adjusting for covariates, lower cholesterol levels were significantly associated with MDD (OR 4.229 CI 95% 2.555 - 7.000, p<.001) and suicide attempt (OR 5.540 CI 95% 2.825 - 10.866, p<.001) Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that lower levels of cholesterol are associated with mood disorders like MDD and suicidal behavior. More mechanistic studies are needed to further explain this association.;Cholesterol | Depression | Suicide attempt;37;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Low vitality is a recurrent problem in veterinary perinatology, and several factors can directly or indirectly culminate in neonatal death. One prime determinant of low vitality in animals is foetal hypoxia resulting from prolonged labour or dystocia. Factors such as foetal acidosis, metabolic and electrolyte imbalances, and asphyxia can quickly lead to neonatal death, while others are a consequence of low vitality in which the weak neonate cannot reach the teat and feed, thermoregulate, or breathe because of airway obstruction by meconium. Neonatal hypoxia can also lead to a failure of passive transfer and neonatal infections. The birth weight, the age of the dam, the size of the litter, and parity are also relevant vitality determinants. Scoring systems, similar to the Apgar score used with human babies, have been modified in veterinary neonatology to identify low vitality neonates in need of medical intervention. This review focuses on the vitality assessments and risk factors associated with neonatal mortality in puppies, calves and piglets. Also reviewed is the relationship of umbilical cord morphology and hypoxia with the premature passing of meconium into the amniotic sac and subsequent aspiration into the lungs. Veterinary literature shows a need to improve Apgar scores in animals by using blood gases and other clinical and laboratory tests. Also, it is necessary to better train veterinarians and personnel to identify low vitality neonates and when necessary to implement a rapid medical intervention.;Apgar score | Hypoxia | Meconium staining | Newborn welfare | Perinatal asphyxia | Stillbirth;20;0;;;;undefined;

With the increased interest in domestic farm animal welfare from both the political and societal agendas, environmental enrichment (EE) is becoming an interesting solution, offering an alternative not only to optimize the welfare of the animals but to improve the animals’ performance. In general, the development of more intensive production systems and specialized techniques has provided benefits in terms of productivity, but at the expense of the behavioural needs and welfare of kept animals. In intensive farming, welfare concerns are still often related to barren environments and crowded conditions. Producers need to balance the requirements to improve welfare conditions on the farm with practical considerations. This paper provides a review of the scientific literature, focusing on recent advances on the welfare-relevant consequences of EE on harmful social behaviours due to intensively farmed confinement in pigs, laying hens and dairy calves, including a discussion with regard to their relevance and suitability.;Abnormal behaviour | Aggressive behaviour | Cross-suckling | Environmental enrichment | Feather pecking | Frustration | Tail-biting | Welfare conditions;14;0;;;;undefined;

Temperature evaluations were performed with an infrared thermal thermography camera in the eyes, the thorax and the scrotal area, at 24 h before castration (RV), immediately after castration (PC), 24 and 48 h post-surgery. The study also evaluated plasma glucose and lactate concentrations. The thorax presented lower infrared temperature in the groups C1I13 and C2I13 than those in C1I5 and C2I5 (p<0.05). Regardless of age and type of castration, plasma lactate values increased PC (P=0.0001). The piglets castrated at 5 days of age were less susceptible to presenting temperature changes regardless of the number of incisions, while the animals castrated at 13 days with two incisions showed lower temperatures and imbalances in plasma glucose and lactate concentrations. Castration in piglets of 13 days causes a decrease in temperature in the lacrimal caruncle immediately after performing surgery.

In particular, we discuss the literature in the context of recent trends in main olfactory epithelium and vomeronasal organ functions, briefly explaining the main differences between the anatomical olfactory structures of various domestic animals. Subsequently, examples of animal welfare implications of diet selection, predation, aversion, breeding and mother-young bonding behaviours are described. An ethological view of olfaction in addition to the brain structure and olfaction morphology aspects has been covered, as it offers a promising approach in the welfare of mammalian species under our care. We conclude that the knowledge of the roles played by olfaction in chemical communication may help improving housing conditions, fulfilment of feeding requirements, handling and breeding of companion, farm and zoo mammals, and promote the development of appropriate social, sexual, parental and feeding behaviours thus enhancing animal welfare.";Animal welfare | Carnivores | Feeding behaviour | Maternal behaviour | Olfaction | Sexual behaviour | Social behaviour | Ungulates | Vomeronasal organ;11;0;;;;undefined;

Objectives: a) to determine the prevalence of depression and the consumption of unhealthy food in first-year college students; and b) to analyze the association between depression score and food consumption frequency. Methods: a cross-sectional study was carried out in 1,104 freshman students, 40.3% men and 59.7% women, at a public university in Mexico City. The 20-item depression scale (CES-D) and Food Frequency Questionnaire were applied to measure depressive symptoms and food consumption.

Results: the prevalence of depression symptoms was 18.2% in men and 27.5% in women (p < 0.001). A considerable proportion of the students reported poor eating habits: consumption of fried food (30.3%), sweetened drinks (49.0%) and sugary food (51.8%) 2-7 times/week; and less than half the students practiced vigorous physical activity (39.7%). In women, a higher depression score was associated with a higher frequency of consumption of fast food (OR = 2.08, p = 0.018), fried food (OR = 1.92, p = 0.01) and sugary food (OR = 2.16, p = 0.001), and a lower frequency of physical exercise (< 75 min/week; OR = 1.80, p = 0.017). In men, no association was observed between depression score and food consumption variables. An association was observed between depression and low exercise frequency (OR = 2.22, p = 0.006). Conclusions: women vulnerable to depression may use food to cope with negative mood states.

To develop a genotyping method, the genome sequence of Staphylococcus chromogenes MU970 was analysed. The analysis showed nine virulence genes described in Staphylococcus aureus. The MLVA was developed using four loci identified in the genome of S. chromogenes MU970. This genotyping method was examined in 23 strains of CNS isolated from goat mastitis. The rate of discrimination for MLVA was 0.8893, and the highest rates of discrimination per the index of Simpson and Hunter-Gaston were 0.926 and 0.968 for the locus 346_06, respectively. The virulence genes were present in all strains of S. chromogenes but not in other CNS.

Early identification of developmental delays or disabilities in children is a challenge and a global concern. In Mexico, the prevalence of childhood disability is 6%, and it is estimated that 25% of the unattended delays will have consequences on their potential. VANEDELA is a rapid screening test to detect and prevent developmental disorders in primary health care. Objective. To determine the external validity and test-retest reliability of the behavioral (DB) and reflex (DR) developmental formats of the VANEDELA screening test, compared with the diagnostic test of Gesell's Developmental Schedule Test. Method. Descriptive, transversal, and prospective study in 379 infants aged one to 24 months attending the Neurodevelopment Monitoring Laboratory / INP and the ISSSTE Tlalpan Family Medicine Clinic from 2011 to 2014. Measurements: A set of four aspects was evaluated including validity by external criteria: sensitivity, specificity, positive-negative predictive criteria, and test-retest reliability. Results. In the DB format, we found a 79% - 89% sensitivity (S) and a 83% - 95% specificity (Sp). In the DR format, a 18% - 35% sensitivity and a 81% - 96% specificity were found. Using both DB-DR formats, we found a 82% - 89% sensitivity and 72% to 91% specificity, and a test-retest reliability .62-1. Discussion and conclusion.

The highest biomass production was observed in medium supplemented with 1000 mg of DEHP/L. Half-life of DEHP biodegradation, biodegradation constant of DEHP, and percentage of removal efficiency (%E) were also determined. P. ostreatus degraded 100% of DEHP after 504 h. %E was 99.3% and 98.4% for 500 and 1000 mg of DEHP/L, respectively. Intermediate compounds of biodegraded DEHP were identified by GC-MS and a DEHP biodegradation pathway was proposed using quantum chemical investigation. DEHP might be metabolized through three pathways; a de-esterification pathway, an oxidation pathway and an oxidation-hydrolysis pathway, forming phthalic acid, acetic acid and butanediol, respectively.

This phenomenon is characterized by a response of intense and disproportionate fear to what would be expected by the degree of threat posed by the stimulus. The behavior of dogs with noise phobia is variable, ranging from mild reactions such as increased gasp, sialorrhea, attempts to hide or escape, to severe reactions that include destructive behaviors and self-harm. Stimuli that occur unpredictably, intermittently, and in high intensity, such as fireworks or storms, are more likely to induce a phobia than those occurring with a lower intensity and more frequently and in a predictable way; Therefore, this behavioral problem usually goes unnoticed in subacute stages until the signs become evident. Thus, due to its prevalence (38% in reported cases) and its consequences, noise phobia has important negative implications on animal welfare; being important its timely diagnosis and the subsequent treatment with behavioral modification therapy or psychotropic drugs. The objectives of this review are: To analyze the published information on the different aspects of this behavioral problem, such as the etiology and the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in the fear circuits as well as in the extinction process, and to evaluate the different treatments.";Amygdala | Antidepressants | Dogs | Fear | Noise phobia | Serotonin;0;0;;;;undefined;

To identify common or rare genetic variation with potential therapeutic implications for T2D, we analyzed and replicated genome-wide protein coding variation in a total of 8,227 individuals with T2D and 12,966 individuals without T2D of Latino descent. We identified a novel genetic variant in the IGF2 gene associated with ∼20% reduced risk for T2D. This variant, which has an allele frequency of 17% in the Mexican population but is rare in Europe, prevents splicing between IGF2 exons 1 and 2. We show in vitro and in human liver and adipose tissue that the variant is associated with a specific, allele-dosage–dependent reduction in the expression of IGF2 isoform 2. In individuals who do not carry the protective allele, expression of IGF2 isoform 2 in adipose is positively correlated with both incidence of T2D and increased plasma glycated hemoglobin in individuals without T2D, providing support that the protective effects are mediated by reductions in IGF2 isoform 2. Broad phenotypic examination of carriers of the protective variant revealed no association with other disease states or impaired reproductive health. These findings suggest that reducing IGF2 isoform 2 expression in relevant tissues has potential as a new therapeutic strategy for T2D, even beyond the Latin American population, with no major adverse effects on health or reproduction.;;32;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;10ST1035;National Institutes of Health

Material and Methods: Data regarding patient demographics, clinical stage, saliva and tumor tissue samples were collected. The saliva was analyzed for sE-cadherin protein levels and was compared to the mE-cadherin immunohistochemical expression levels in tumor tissues, which were assessed via the HercepTest® method. Patients without cancer were included in the study as a control group for comparisons of the sE-cadherin levels. Results: sE-cadherin levels in the saliva of patients without cancer were lower than those in patients with cancer, and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.031). Low mE-cadherin expression was statistically significantly associated with lymph node positivity (p=0.015) and advanced clinical stage (p=0.001). The inverse relationship between mE-cadherin and sE-cadherin was significant in terms of lymph node positivity (p=0.014) and advanced clinical stage (p=0.037). Conclusions: The results suggest that sE-cadherin levels are significantly increased in patients with oral cancer and that its low expression within the membrane as well as the progression of the disease appear to be inversely associated with levels of sE-cadherin in the saliva.;E-cadher.in | Oral cancer | Saliva;4;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

These treatments were repeated in the same animals when lambs were 3 (G3), 10 (G10), and 20 (G20) days old. The behavior of lambs was recorded during each 15-minute separation period, and data were examined using covariance analysis to determine differences for repeated measures over time. In general, after the physical separation from the ewes (A+V+W and A+V+S groups), lambs emitted more vocalizations (3, 10, and 20 days old) and displayed more frequent urination (3 days old), exploration of objects (20 days old) and conspecifics (3 and 20 days old), escape attempts (A+V+W at 10 and 20 days of age; A+V+S at 20 days old), or walking (A+V+W at 10 and 20 days of age; A+V+S at 3, 10 and 20 days old) and lying down (10 and 20 days old for A+V+W and 3 days old for A+V+S) in comparison to the other treatments. G10 and G20 lambs of the A+V, A+V+W, and A+V+S groups also displayed greater values for walking activity (P < 0.05) in comparison with G3 lambs. In general, it is concluded that the exhibition of the examined behavioral parameters was increased with the degree of sensorial isolation, and particularly when the physical contact between the lambs and their dams was restricted. As lambs became older, they showed an increased behavioral reactivity in response to the increased sensorial isolation.";attachment | ewe | separation | sheep | stress | welfare;5;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The women present themselves materially and symbolically as agents of regulation with respect to male sexuality, itself constructed as overwhelming and insatiable, which, were it not for services provided by the sex workers, would threaten the family-based social order. Through in-depth interviews with 19 sex workers and 5 municipal officials, this paper discusses how the sex gender system results in a series of borders that are both geographical and subjective.

The objective was to identify periodicities in the number of certified deaths in Mexico. We analized death certificates from 2000 to 2010, with the tenth version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), including date and hour of death and selecting frequent respiratory and general causes of death: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, pneumonia-influenza, heart failure, left heart disease (hypertensive and ischemic), malignant tumors and diabetes mellitus (DM) and the remaining causes of death. We searched for associations between the number of deaths, and the hour, month and year of death, through Poisson regression models, including indicator variables for hour, month and year. Results: Pneumonia and influenza deaths had a marked seasonal pattern (peak in winter), but the pattern was also observed for heart failure, left heart disease, COPD and DM but not in perinatal deaths. We observed a circadian pattern in deaths with a maximum between 7-11 AM, and a second peak about 8 PM in the studied diseases except by perinatal causes. Conclusions: Seasonality of analyzed deaths is likely due to influenza and if this is true, could be preventable with vaccination. The mechanism of diurnal increase in deaths is unknown although usually attributed to increase in symphathetic activity associated to awakening and start of physical activity.;Circadian rhythm | Death certificates | Deaths | Mexico | Seasonality;0;0;;;;undefined;

Methods Serum levels of IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3 were measured in 93 SLE patients and 67 healthy individuals. The associations with overall disease activity, organ-specific damage, and SLE-related antibodies were assessed. Results Median IFN-λ1 levels were 0 pg/mL (range, 0-510 pg/mL) and 0 pg/mL (0-171 pg/mL; P = 0.814) in SLE patients and control subjects, respectively. These figures were 0 pg/mL (0-28 pg/mL) and 0 pg/mL (0-43 pg/mL; P = 0.659) for IFN-λ2, as well as 83 pg/mL (0-965 pg/mL) and 42 pg/mL (0-520 pg/mL; P = 0.002) for IFN-λ3, respectively. According to the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index categories, IFN-λ3 levels were 44 pg/mL (0-158 pg/mL) in quiescent, 117 pg/mL (0-344 pg/mL) in mild, 79 pg/mL (0-965 pg/mL) in moderate, and 78 pg/mL (0-329 pg/mL) in severe disease, with the highest levels found in patients with serosal or cutaneous involvement. In line with this, IFN-λ3 levels were inversely correlated with C3 (ρ = -0.44; 95% confidence interval, -0.62 to -0.20; P = 0.0003) and C4 (ρ = -0.40; 95% confidence interval, -0.59 to -0.15; P = 0.0001) complement proteins. In addition, higher IFN-λ3 levels were found in patients positive for anti-Ro/SSA antibodies than in those negative for that antibody (122 pg/mL [0-965 pg/mL] vs. 0 pg/mL [0-165 pg/mL]; P = 0.001). The concentration of IFN-λ3 also was higher in patients receiving glucocorticoids (104 pg/mL [0-965 pg/mL] vs. 30 pg/mL [0-165 pg/mL]; P = 0.009), and a dose-related effect was observed. Conclusions Interferon λ3, a subtype of type III IFNs, is associated with the extent of lupus activity, in particular with active serosal and cutaneous disease. This association could be mechanistically related to anti-Ro/SSA antibodies.";anti-Ro/SSA antibodies | interferons | systemic lupus erythematosus;20;0;;;City;undefined;City, University of London

patterns against health system performance and identify specific needs for resource allocation in research, policy development, and programme decision making. Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Methods: We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE difered from expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate. Findings: The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was in Singapore, at 75·2 years (95% uncertainty interval 71·9-78·6) for females and 72·0 years (68·8-75·1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central African Republic (45·6 years [42·0-49·5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41·5 years [39·0-44·0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 6·24 years (5·97-6·48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6·04 years (5·74-6·27) for males and 6·49 years (6·08-6·77) for females, whereas HALE at age 65 years increased by 1·78 years (1·61-1·93) for males and 1·96 years (1·69-2·13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (-2·3% [-5·9 to 0·9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs ofset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the fve lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections, comprising 16·1% of all DALYs. Total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally. Interpretation: At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs ofset by increased NCD DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, targeted prevention eforts, and development assistance for health, including fnancial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust support.";;1297;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;P30AG047845;National Institutes of Health

September 2017;The Lancet;01406736;16590;1474547X;Journal;390;10100;;1211-1259;Background As mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. Methods We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57·6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 40·8-75·9 million [7·2%, 6·0-8·3]), 45·1 million (29·0-62·8 million [5·6%, 4·0-7·2]), 36·3 million (25·3-50·9 million [4·5%, 3·8-5·3]), 34·7 million (23·0-49·6 million [4·3%, 3·5-5·2]), and 34·1 million (23·5-46·0 million [4·2%, 3·2-5·3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2·7% (95% UI 2·3-3·1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10·4% (95% UI 9·0-11·8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95% UI 6862-11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018-19 228). Interpretation The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-todate information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response.;;4086;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;R01MH110163;National Institutes of Health

prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specifc mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods: We estimated cause-specifc deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specifc causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specifc deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings: The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2-73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3% (18·5-20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43% (8·00-8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16 - age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL signifcantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval. Globally, the fve leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a fner level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation: The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and confict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might refect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which efective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.";;2894;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;2015-2020;National Institutes of Health

September 2017;The Lancet;01406736;16590;1474547X;Journal;390;10100;;1345-1422;Background: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of risk factor exposure and attributable burden of disease. By providing estimates over a long time series, this study can monitor risk exposure trends critical to health surveillance and inform policy debates on the importance of addressing risks in context. Methods: We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2016. This study included 481 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk (RR) and exposure estimates from 22 717 randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources, according to the GBD 2016 source counting methods. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. Finally, we explored four drivers of trends in attributable burden: population growth, population ageing, trends in risk exposure, and all other factors combined. Findings: Since 1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not change significantly for four risks, and decreased significantly for 31 risks. Among risks that are leading causes of burden of disease, child growth failure and household air pollution showed the most significant declines, while metabolic risks, such as body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose, showed significant increases. In 2016, at Level 3 of the hierarchy, the three leading risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for men were smoking (124.1 million DALYs [95% UI 111.2 million to 137.0 million]), high systolic blood pressure (122.2 million DALYs [110.3 million to 133.3 million], and low birthweight and short gestation (83.0 million DALYs [78.3 million to 87.7 million]), and for women, were high systolic blood pressure (89.9 million DALYs [80.9 million to 98.2 million]), high body-mass index (64.8 million DALYs [44.4 million to 87.6 million]), and high fasting plasma glucose (63.8 million DALYs [53.2 million to 76.3 million]). In 2016 in 113 countries, the leading risk factor in terms of attributable DALYs was a metabolic risk factor. Smoking remained among the leading five risk factors for DALYs for 109 countries, while low birthweight and short gestation was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 38 countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of important drivers of change in trends of burden attributable to risk factors, between 2006 and 2016 exposure to risks explains an 9.3% (6.9-11.6) decline in deaths and a 10.8% (8.3-13.1) decrease in DALYs at the global level, while population ageing accounts for 14.9% (12.7-17.5) of deaths and 6.2% (3.9-8.7) of DALYs, and population growth for 12.4% (10.1-14.9) of deaths and 12.4% (10.1-14.9) of DALYs. The largest contribution of trends in risk exposure to disease burden is seen between ages 1 year and 4 years, where a decline of 27.3% (24.9-29.7) of the change in DALYs between 2006 and 2016 can be attributed to declines in exposure to risks. Interpretation: Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome pair provide insights into both the magnitude of health loss attributable to risks and how modification of risk exposure has contributed to health trends. Metabolic risks warrant particular policy attention, due to their large contribution to global disease burden, increasing trends, and variable patterns across countries at the same level of development. GBD 2016 findings show that, while it has huge potential to improve health, risk modification has played a relatively small part in the past decade.;;1616;1;repositoryam;Green;NIA;R01AG030153;National Institute on Aging

that enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. Methods: We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0.5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. Findings: Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates - a measure of relative inequality - increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86.9 years (95% UI 86.7-87.2), and for men in Singapore, at 81.3 years (78.8-83.7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. Interpretation Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.";;477;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;R01MH110163;National Institutes of Health

behind"". Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030. Methods: We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 25th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 975th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment. Findings Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 567 (IQR 319-668) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (868, 95% uncertainty interval 846-889), Iceland (860, 841-876), and Sweden (856, 818-878) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (109, 96-119), the Central African Republic (110, 88-138), and Somalia (113, 95-131) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past. Interpretation GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations.";;194;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;P30AG047845;National Institutes of Health

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema syndrome (CPFES) belong to ILD class with the latter having a limited survival prognosis. In clinical environment high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is used to detect CPFE; however, there is still controversy about the amount of emphysema observed in HRCT to declare CPFES. Consequently, to help in the diagnosis of CPFES to develop an alternative technique seems to be attractive. In this study, we propose a multichannel acoustic approach to discriminate between IPF and CPFES parameterizing the multichannel lung sounds information linearly and classifying it by neural networks (NN). The NN performance using different features provided values above 90% in the validation phase. Furthermore, to test the trained NN, the proposed approach was applied on new data from five patients 3 diagnosed by experts as CPFES and 2 with IPF. The univariate autoregressive model obtained the best classification followed by the feature vector formed by the percentile frequencies augmented by the total power of the acoustic information. Results indicate that multichannel acoustic analysis is promising to discern between these two ILDs.";;3;0;;;;undefined;

The usefulness of this technique was studied on respiratory-cardiovascular data from young women with vasovagal syncope (VVS) and from healthy subjects. The study included 16 female patients diagnosed with VVS and 24 age-matched healthy subjects (12 women). All subjects were enrolled in a head-up tilt (HUT) test, breathing normally, including 5 min of supine position and 18 to 28 min of 70° orthostatic phase. The MSD parameters were dynamically obtained for 5-min windows shifted by 1 min during HUT test. In supine position there were no considerable differences. During orthostatic phase, parameters from MSD showed a highly significantly (p=0.00005) increased occurrence of impaired respiratory-cardiovascular interactions in female patients susceptible to vasovagal syncope. This study provided promising results for a new multivariate method to investigate respiratory-cardiovascular interactions.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Eight separate groups with 25 tick larvae were inoculated with the fungus, cypermethrin, and D-limonene, and four groups were used as untreated controls. The groups were inoculated with serial dilutions of each treatment material: for example, conidial concentrations were 1 × 101, 1 × 102, 1 × 103, 1 × 104, 1 × 105, 1 × 106, 1 × 107, and 1 × 108.

Significant differences were obtained between fungal concentrations, with larval mortalities ranging from 29 to 100%; the D-limonene concentrations showed significant differences, with mortalities that ranged from 47.9 to 82.6%, and cypermethrin mortalities ranged from 69.9 to 89.9% when each was applied alone. In the combined application, the serial dilution of the Ma14 fungus plus cypermethrin at 0.1% concentration caused mortalities ranging from 92.9 to 100%; the mix of serially diluted Ma14 plus D-limonene at 0.1% caused mortalities from 10.3 to 100%; and the mix consisting of serially diluted D-limonene plus cypermethrin at 0.1% caused mortalities from 7.4 to 35.9%.

This recording can be seen as a surface that roughens with time. Dynamic scaling studies roughening processes or growing interfaces. In this theory, a set of exponents —obtained from scale invariance properties— characterize rough interfaces growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate scaling behavior in EEG time series fluctuations of a chemical animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy, with dynamic scaling to detect changes on seizure onset. We analyzed local variables in different sampling intervals and estimated rough, scaling and dynamic exponents. Results exhibited long-range correlations in interictal activity. Results of renormalization and data collapsing confirmed that each epoch of EEG fluctuations for interictal, preictal and postictal collapse in a curve in different scales, each segment independently; remarkably, we found non-scaling behavior in seizures epochs. Data for the different sampling intervals for ictal period do not collapse in one curve, which implies that ictal activity does not exhibit the same scaling behavior than the other epochs. Statistical significant differences of growth exponent were found between interictal and ictal segment, while for scaling exponent, significant differences were found between interictal and postictal segment. These results confirm the potential of scaling exponents as characteristic parameters to detect changes on seizure onset, which suggests their use as inputs for analysis methods for seizure detection in long-term recordings, while changes in growth exponent are potentially useful for prediction purposes.";Animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy | EEG fluctuations analysis | Rough interfaces | Scaling exponents;2;0;;;IPN;undefined;Instituto Politécnico Nacional

It is expected that successful products give the consumer extraordinary experiences. The research in consumption experience is growing, but much work still needs to be done to understand the food and beverage experience. A qualitative study was conducted using contextual focus groups to explore the building blocks of consumers’ drinking experience of industrial and craft beers. The results show that drinking experience is shaped by our cognitive, sensory or affective systems, especially during the core consumption experience. Elements such as attitudes, consumption habits, and individual versus social consumption, shopping experience and product benefits are also responsible for shaping the experience, but are more relevant during the pre-consumption or post-consumption experience. Gender differences occur more frequently in the affective experience, as women search more for relaxation while men for excitement and stimulation while drinking beer. When comparing industrial users versus craft, in the latter the cognitive and shopping experiences are more relevant. Overall, the results showed that the drinking experience of beers can be studied as a function of the salient human system used during product interaction, and this systems act as the building blocks of the drinking experience of beer. This information can be applied in consumer research studies to further study the experiential differences across products and consumers.;Affects | Beer | Consumption experience | Product experience;19;0;;;;undefined;

Human systems include a sensory system to perceive the surrounding world, an affective system that evokes emotional responses to certain stimuli, and a cognitive system that makes meaning and processes information. We hypothesise that experience is a combination between these three systems rather than a linear continuum of hedonic reactions. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted a study measuring the experience of drinking craft and industrial beers. A total of 400 consumers were invited to drink beer, rate their liking and select a set of phrases that better described their drinking experience. Results showed no significant difference in expected liking and purchase intention between the eight beers evaluated. However, a difference between beers was observed for the CATA phrases. Cognitive phrases were more frequently checked for craft beers, while sensory, and affective phrases were more frequently checked for industrial beers. A Multiple Factor Analysis for Contingency Tables showed that the sensory and cognitive systems were more related to liking than the affective system.;Affects | Beer | Cognition | Product experience | Senses;29;0;;;;undefined;

In recent years, a change of consumption has been noticed in several countries with an increase in interest for traditional and craft products. This is the case, for example, for the beer sector, going from a beer category dominated by one style to a wider range of options of industrial beers and to less commercial options such as craft beers. A change in patterns of consumption is usually an indicator that the perception towards the product is changing. In this study, the objective is to understand the impact of gender (men versus women) and type of consumption (craft versus industrial beer) on mental beer representations. Four groups of participants were asked to visually sort a set of beer in the presence of brand and packaging. The results show both similarities and differences in the categorization made by each group of consumers. Overall, participants agreed more on their categorization of industrial beers than they did with craft beers. Gender differences were perceived in the sorting task especially in terms of the number of groups used to sort beers, more groups in men; but also in the words used to describe beers. When comparing the results across women and men, it was seen that the latter sort the beers based on previous knowledge (cognitive dimension) while women rely more on the affective dimension (like – do not like) to sort the beers. An interaction effect was also found between gender and type of consumption which highlights the complex relationship that consumers have towards beers.";Beer | DISTATIS | Gender | Habits of consumption | Sorting task;19;0;;;;undefined;

causes that should not be fatal in the presence of effective medical care (ie, amenable mortality). Previous analyses of mortality amenable to health care only focused on high-income countries and faced several methodological challenges. In the present analysis, we use the highly standardised cause of death and risk factor estimates generated through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to improve and expand the quantification of personal health-care access and quality for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. Methods We mapped the most widely used list of causes amenable to personal health care developed by Nolte and McKee to 32 GBD causes. We accounted for variations in cause of death certification and misclassifications through the extensive data standardisation processes and redistribution algorithms developed for GBD. To isolate the effects of personal health-care access and quality, we risk-standardised cause-specific mortality rates for each geography-year by removing the joint effects of local environmental and behavioural risks, and adding back the global levels of risk exposure as estimated for GBD 2015. We employed principal component analysis to create a single, interpretable summary measure-the Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index-on a scale of 0 to 100. The HAQ Index showed strong convergence validity as compared with other health-system indicators, including health expenditure per capita (r=0·88), an index of 11 universal health coverage interventions (r=0·83), and human resources for health per 1000 (r=0·77). We used free disposal hull analysis with bootstrapping to produce a frontier based on the relationship between the HAQ Index and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of overall development consisting of income per capita, average years of education, and total fertility rates. This frontier allowed us to better quantify the maximum levels of personal health-care access and quality achieved across the development spectrum, and pinpoint geographies where gaps between observed and potential levels have narrowed or widened over time. Findings Between 1990 and 2015, nearly all countries and territories saw their HAQ Index values improve; nonetheless, the difference between the highest and lowest observed HAQ Index was larger in 2015 than in 1990, ranging from 28·6 to 94·6. Of 195 geographies, 167 had statistically significant increases in HAQ Index levels since 1990, with South Korea, Turkey, Peru, China, and the Maldives recording among the largest gains by 2015. Performance on the HAQ Index and individual causes showed distinct patterns by region and level of development, yet substantial heterogeneities emerged for several causes, including cancers in highest-SDI countries; chronic kidney disease, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections among middle-SDI countries; and measles and tetanus among lowest-SDI countries. While the global HAQ Index average rose from 40·7 (95% uncertainty interval, 39·0-42·8) in 1990 to 53·7 (52·2-55·4) in 2015, far less progress occurred in narrowing the gap between observed HAQ Index values and maximum levels achieved; at the global level, the difference between the observed and frontier HAQ Index only decreased from 21·2 in 1990 to 20·1 in 2015. If every country and territory had achieved the highest observed HAQ Index by their corresponding level of SDI, the global average would have been 73·8 in 2015. Several countries, particularly in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa, reached HAQ Index values similar to or beyond their development levels, whereas others, namely in southern sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, lagged behind what geographies of similar development attained between 1990 and 2015. Interpretation This novel extension of the GBD Study shows the untapped potential for personal health-care access and quality improvement across the development spectrum. Amid substantive advances in personal health care at the national level, heterogeneous patterns for individual causes in given countries or territories suggest that few places have consistently achieved optimal health-care access and quality across health-system functions and therapeutic areas. This is especially evident in middle-SDI countries, many of which have recently undergone or are currently experiencing epidemiological transitions. The HAQ Index, if paired with other measures of health-system characteristics such as intervention coverage, could provide a robust avenue for tracking progress on universal health coverage and identifying local priorities for strengthening personal health-care quality and access throughout the world.";;366;1;repositoryam;Green;NSF;0IER1301/22;National Science Foundation

Tools currently employed in the clinical field can only compute injury volumes with qualitative and manual methods. The present work proposes a semiautomatic computational method for calculating these volumes. Users of the method are only required to select a single point comprising the injury from one of the slides of a series of medical images. This seed point is used by the proposed algorithm to compute the average and standard deviation of the gray scale magnitude of adjacent pixels which comprise the injury. The method was tested using magnetic resonance images and compared with the volume manually computed by experts using a medical image viewer software. The proposed method showed an absolute error of 7.8%, compared with the averaged volume computed by the experts.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was evaluate sperm quality and distribution of N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid and mannose residues in sperm cryopreserved of red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied twenty samples of ejaculated semen for each cryoprotectant dimethylsulfoxide or polyvinylpyrrolidone. Carbohydrate identification was carried out with lectins Triticum vulgaris agglutinin to N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid and Concanavalia ensiformis for mannose residues. Sperm viability was not altered but motility decreased significantly with both crioprotectants compared with fresh sperm. RESULTS: Neither the number of WGA positive sperm nor the distribution of N-acetylglucosamine and/or sialic acid residues were affected by the cryopreservation procedure. The sperm proportion with fluorescence associated with the presence of mannose residues was higher in thawed sperm. CONCLUSION: Values obtained with the cryopreservation technique proposed in this study by freezing drops in liquid nitrogen, were within normal parameters established for good quality fresh semen. We can say that it can be used for assisted reproduction of Buteo jamaicenc.;Bird prey | Cryopreservation | Mannose | Sialic acid;1;0;;;;undefined;

Data were analysed through the Mann Whitney test and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Socioeconomic and farm variables influenced the use of cultivated grassland, as observed in Group 1. This group showed a bigger proportion of farmers (60 %) who indicated a positive intention to use cultivated grasslands, in comparison with 36 % of farmers from Group 2. Farmers from both groups perceived similarly the utility and importance of the use of cultivated grassland; however, farmers' intention of Group 1 showed a significant correlation (P<0.05) with utility and importance. Other factors influencing the use of cultivated grasslands were the positive beliefs, social referents and difficulties perceived of the innovation.

Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out with 601 children and adolescents from Mexico aged 5–19 years. The participants were randomly divided into the following two groups: the development sample (n = 398) and the validation sample (n = 203). The validity of previously published equations (e.g., Slaughter) was also assessed. The percentage of body fat was estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The anthropometric measurements included height, sitting height, weight, waist and arm circumferences, skinfolds (triceps, biceps, subscapular, supra-iliac, and calf), and elbow and bitrochanteric breadth. Linear regression models were estimated with the percentage of body fat as the dependent variable and the anthropometric measurements as the independent variables. Results Equations were created based on combinations of six to nine anthropometric variables and had coefficients of determination (r2) equal to or higher than 92.4% for boys and 85.8% for girls. In the validation sample, the developed equations had high r2 values (≥85.6% in boys and ≥78.1% in girls) in all age groups, low standard errors (SE ≤ 3.05% in boys and ≤3.52% in girls), and the intercepts were not different from the origin (p > 0.050). Using the previously published equations, the coefficients of determination were lower, and/or the intercepts were different from the origin. Conclusions The equations developed in this study can be used to assess the percentage of body fat of Mexican schoolchildren and adolescents, as they demonstrate greater validity and lower error compared with previously published equations.;Adolescents | Anthropometry | Body fat | Children | Dual X-ray absorptiometry | Mexico;13;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

We conducted a GWAS of colorectal cancer (CRC) in 6,597 African Americans (1,894 cases and 4,703 controls) (Stage 1) and followed up the most promising markers in a replication set of 2,041 participants of African descent (891 cases and 1,150 controls) (Stage 2). We identified a novel variant, rs56848936 in the gene SYMPK at 19q13.3, associated with colon cancer risk (odds ratio 0.61 for the risk allele G, p = 2.4 × 10−8). The frequency of the G allele was 0.06 in African Americans, compared to <0.01 in Europeans, Asians and Amerindians in the 1000 Genomes project. In addition, a variant previously identified through fine-mapping in this GWAS in the region 19q13.1, rs7252505, was confirmed to be more strongly associated with CRC in the African American replication set than the variant originally reported in Europeans (rs10411210). The association between rs7252505 and CRC was of borderline significance (p = 0.05) in a Hispanic population GWAS with 1,611 CRC cases and 4,330 controls. With the three datasets combined, the odds ratio was 0.84 for the risk allele A (95% confidence interval 0.79–0.89, p = 3.7 × 10−8).

Methods: Cross-sectional study which included 32 extended families resident in Mexico City. GERD symptoms severity was assessed by the ReQuest in Practice questionnaire. Heritability and genetic correlation were determined using the Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines software. Results: 585 subjects were included, the mean age was 42 (±16.7) years, 57% were women. The heritability of the severity of some GERD symptoms was h2 = 0.27, 0.27, 0.37, and 0.34 (p-value <1.0x10-5) for acidity complaints, lower abdominal complaints, sleep disturbances, and total ReQuest score, respectively. Heritability of metabolic syndrome components ranged from 0.40 for fasting plasma glucose to 0.61 for body mass index and diabetes mellitus. The heritability for fibrinogen and C-reactive protein was 0.64 and 0.38, respectively. Statistically significant genetic correlations were found between acidity complaints and fasting plasma glucose (ρG = 0.40); sleep disturbances and fasting plasma glucose (ρG = 0.36); acidity complaints and diabetes mellitus (ρG = 0.49) and between total ReQuest score and fasting plasma glucose (ρG = 0.43). The rest of metabolic syndrome components did not correlate with GERD symptoms. Conclusion: Genetic factors substantially explain the phenotypic variance of the severity of some GERD symptoms, metabolic syndrome components and inflammation markers. Observed genetic correlations suggest that these phenotypes share common genes. These findings suggest conducting further investigation, as the determination of a linkage analysis in order to identify regions of susceptibility for developing of GERD and metabolic syndrome.";;11;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The present article focuses on the relationship between total coliform bacteria levels and the increase of human digestive tract diseases in the highly polluted Atoyac River in the central Mexican states of Puebla and Tlaxcala. Pollution has become a potential health hazard for people living in nearby river communities. Based on data collected from six of the most contaminated riverside municipalities, two environmental models were developed taking into consideration the health of the entire population, not simply that of its individual members. Such models estimate a health-disease function that confirm the link between Atoyac River pollution and the incidence of gastrointestinal diseases. The causal relation between pollution and gastrointestinal disease incentivizes the creation of epidemiological and public health programs aimed at reducing the environmental health impact of the pollution associated with the Atoyac River. The results presented here are the first of their kind of this river and will serve as basis for future research exploring other similarly contaminated riparian communities. As the causes of pollution are directly related to the economic development and population growth of the region, further research should be conducted for prevention of diseases, educational programs, water remediation and conservation programs that will have a positive impact on the quality of life of the population presently at risk.;Ecological models | Gastrointestinal diseases | Health-disease function | Water pollution;10;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;120-2015;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Action potentials were produced by a Hodgkin-Huxley type model including different types ofK+, Na+ and Ca2+ ionic channels while the buffered diffusion of Ca2+ was simulated using the finite element method. In this model, Ca2+-dependent mechanisms (i.e. ionic channels and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms) are directly regulated by the concentration of Ca2+ at the submembrane space estimated from the diffusion model. According to our simulations, the Ca2+ transients produced by the electrical activity pattern are capable of reaching depths as high as 3 μmfrom the Ca2+ channels despite the buffering properties of the cytosol. In addition, we show that the activity of both Ca2+ buffers and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms allows the continuous firing of action potentials by preventing the accumulation of Ca2+ in the vicinity of the cell membrane. Finally, our simulations suggest that submembrane Ca2+ domains are produced by the overlapping of Ca2+ signals from neighbor clusters of Ca2+ channels.

Alzheimer's disease, because this disease is linked to an acetylcholine deficiency. Objective: to evaluate the effect of rosemary oil on learning through the Morris water maze. Material: twenty-four male CD1 mice weighing 20-30g were divided into four groups: 1. saline solution intraperitoneally 2. memantine (10μg/kg) intraperitoneally, 3. rosemary oil (20μg/kg) inhalation and 4.rosemary oil (120μg/Kg) oral administration. The time that remained in each quadrant was measured as a way of evaluating learning, through the recognition of the area. Results: It was found that the group treated with oral rosemary oil had a learning similar to that of memantine, a drug used to treat Alzheimer's, in which the group treated by inhalation was not significant. Conclusions: The present study showed that mice treated with oral rosemary oil did exhibit a tendency to improve performance in the Morris water maze compared to mice treated by inhalation, indicating that improved learning and memory capacity, is the beginning for complementary treatments in Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia using rosemary oil.;Learning | Memory | Morris water maze | Rosemary oil;0;0;;;;undefined;

Many prognostic models in medicine employ BSA to define or refine treatments in very specific settings; in CRC, BSA has been found to be a prognostic factor as well. A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with CRC demonstrated by biopsy, who attended a cancer center during a 7-year period. Multivariate analysis was utilized to define prognostic factors associated with overall survival (OS) employing the Cox model. In this retrospective cohort study, 1465 patients were included; 46.6% were females and 53.4% males (mean age, 59.1 years). Mean BSA was inversely correlated with TNM stages. By multivariate analysis, it was an independent explanatory variable. TNM stages, ""R"" classification, age, lymphocyte count, neutrophil/platelet ratio, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, postoperative morbidity, and BSA were independently associated with OS. Morbidities, surgery type, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were considered confounders after adjusting by TNM stages. BSA is a significant and independent prognostic factor in patients with CRC, and its effect is maintained across TNM strata and other well known clinical prognostic factors. It can be easily used in prognostic models and should be employed to stratify prognosis in therapeutic randomized clinical trials.";colorectal cancer | prognostic factors | serum albumin | survival;24;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

We now know that in addition to genetic defects, -cell organellar dysfunction participates in the earliest stages of the disease; other factors also contribute to this dysfunction, such as excessive production of reactive oxygen species and a decrease in cellular volume and mass. These features usually result from increased apoptosis, which is not adequately compensated for by the characteristic regeneration mechanisms of these cells.

We assessed whether serum albumin levels at admission are associated with new-onset heart failure and in-hospital mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The study included 7,192 patients with ACS with no previous history of heart failure. Patients were divided into quartiles according to serum albumin levels (Q1: ≤3.50 g/dl; Q2: 3.51 to 3.80 g/dl; Q3: 3.81 to 4.08 g/dl; and Q4: >4.08 g/dl). Logistic regressions were used to explore the relations among serum albumin quartiles, new-onset heart failure, and in-hospital mortality. Serum albumin levels were negatively correlated with both high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and white blood cell count at admission. The unadjusted rate for both new-onset heart failure (37.7%, 20.2%, 14.7%, and 11.4% for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively; p <0.0001) and in-hospital mortality (9.8%, 3.4%, 2.0%, and 1.7% for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively; p <0.0001) were higher at lower serum albumin levels. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that serum albumin level ≤3.50 g/dl is an important and independent predictor of both the development of new-onset heart failure (odds ratio 2.31, 95% CI 1.87 to 2.84, p <0.0001) and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.88, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.86, p = 0.003). In conclusion, albumin level ≤3.50 g/dl is an independent predictor of new-onset heart failure and in-hospital mortality in patients with ACS.

In order to hide the complexity of this type of programming, we propose a Graphical Development Environment for the construction of Parallel MPI Applications (GD-MPI). GD-MPI allows the implementation of workflows using a GUI, each workflow represents a set of Java-MPI processes where group creation, point-to-point and collective communications are graphically expressed by developers. In GD-MPI, the basic broadcasting, scattering, and gathering of MPI collective communications is provided. This environment can be extended to include other MPI Standard communications. GD-MPI runs in a web browser and allows users to execute their applications on remote clusters. In this paper we present the GD-MPI environment and its workflow language, which is expressed through a context-free graph grammar that is based on Hyperedge Replacement Grammars (HRG). We also give a comparison of GD-MPI to other graphical platforms for developing parallel applications on MPI. Some examples that illustrate the use of our environment are shown.;Hyperedge Replacement Grammars | MPI | Parallel Computing | Workflow;0;0;;;;undefined;

The resulting data set was analyzed using Gaussian distribution and descriptive statistics. Confidence intervals of 95% were established. The linear relationships between the biochemical analytes were quantified, and an analysis of variance was performed to compare the mean values between the three production groups. The overall concentrations of the described analytes are consistent with values reported by international literature. However, lower values were found for urea, calcium, and sodium; higher values were found for cholesterol, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. Negative correlations were found between β-hydroxybutyrate and glucose or urea, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and urea, and bicarbonate and urea or phosphorus or anion gap. Positive correlations were found between β- hydroxybutyrate and cholesterol or anion gap, non-esterified fatty acids and anion gap, cholesterol and globulin, different analytes of mineral profile and anion gap or urea or glucose, and between sodium and calcium. Differences among the three production groups were observed for β-hydroxybutyrate and cholesterol concentrations. The γ-glutamyl transpeptidase concentration was similar in high and low-producing cows but was higher in comparison to serum levels of dry cows.

The lack of a standardized design methodology has resulted in a large discrepancy in the study of the prevalence of oral lesions. In the Centro Dermatológico Dr. Ladislao de la Pascua, Mexico, the diversity of our patients' oral lesions is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of oral disorders diagnoses at Oral pathology service of Centro Dermatológico Dr. Ladislao de la Pascua. MATERIAL AND METHOD: An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional and retrospective study was made with all clinical records of patients who presented to Oral pathology clinic of the Centro Dermatológico Dr. Ladislao de la Pascua from 2010 to 2014. This was a non-probability sampling of consecutive cases. Study variables were described by frequencies and proportions. We used the Spearman r° to describe the relationship between oral and dermatological diagnosis. All tests were performed with a confidence level of 95% and p < 0.05. This was performed with the SPSS version 21. RESULTS: 1,670 records were reviewed of which only 532 medical records met the selection criteria. The 41 % of oral disorders standed up for infectious disorders (mainly Candida in 29%), 24% for benign tumors, 10% for bullous diseases, 7% for pigmentary disorders, 6% for ulcerative processes and 6% for inflammatory changes. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of infectious entities was observed in this research. Differences in frequency and type of lesions were obtained in comparison to other studies, which could be related to the type of studied patients.

Although the estimated heritability is high, common variants identified by genome-wide association studies explain only a small proportion of this heritability. A combination of linkage and association strategies could be a more robust and powerful approach to identify other obesity-susceptibility variants. We thus sought to identify novel genetic variants associated with obesity-related traits in the Mexican population by combining these methods. We performed a genome-wide linkage scan for body mass index (BMI) and other obesity-related phenotypes in 16 Mexican families using the Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines Program. Associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for associations in an independent cohort. Two suggestive BMI-linkage peaks (logarithm of odds ≥1.5) were observed at chromosomal regions 11q13 and 13q22. Only rs614080 in the 11q13 region was significantly associated with BMI and related traits in these families. This association was also significant in an independent cohort of Mexican adults. Moreover, this variant was significantly associated with GSTP1 gene expression levels in adipose tissue. In conclusion, the rs614080 SNP near the GSTP1 gene was significantly associated with BMI and GSTP1 expression levels in the Mexican population.;;2;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The rat intraperitoneal kainate model and pig intracortical penicillin model were employed. Magnetic facial nerve stimulation was delivered unilaterally at a variety of stimulation parameters, and the effect on ictal epileptiform activity measured by electroencephalography was determined according to an established categorical scale. Principal results In 6 rats and 3 pigs evaluated with 83 stimulation trials, only a single stimulation trial was associated with worsening epileptiform activity according to a standard categorization scheme. Surprisingly, a reduction in the severity of the epileptiform activity was observed in 20 of 50 stimulation trials using patterned stimulation (3 pulses at 30 Hz repeated at 0.5–10 Hz) versus 2 of 33 stimulation trials using simple monotonic patterns (P < 0.005, chi-squared test). The reduction of epileptiform activity after stimulation lasted a few minutes and was reproducible. Major Conclusions Epileptiform activity measured by electroencephalography was not reliably worsened by repetitive facial nerve stimulation with pulsed magnetic energy, even when significant brain exposure to the magnetic field occurred as in the rat model. To the contrary, a temporary reduction in epileptiform activity was often, but not invariably, observed with certain stimulation parameters.;Cerebral blood flow | Facial nerve | Magnetic stimulation | Seizure;0;0;;;;undefined;

Case report: A baby was born in Niger with multiple congenital embryonic malformations on the posterior midline. The most rostral malformation was an accessory limb (polymelia) at the level of the lumbar vertebrae composed of two long bones, a foot and three toes. Accessory male genitalia were present at the base of this malformed accessory limb which had no apparent motor or sensory innervation. The second malformation was a sacral vestigial appendage with an adjacent dermal sinus opening onto the posterior midline and extending internally to the dura through a defect of the vertebral arches. From the published literature and this particular case, we conclude that notomelia is a rare clinical sequela of a neural tube defect (NTD) and is correctly classified as a dysraphic appendage. Conclusion: The recent occurrence of three similar cases in the same ethnic group from Niger, three from consanguineous parents, suggests that genetic factors are likely to contribute significantly to the genesis of this syndrome, consistent with a recent report that mutation of the bovine NHLRC2 gene resulting in a V311A substitution at a highly conserved locus in the NHLRC2 protein is, when homozygous, causally associated with several forms of polymelia including notomelia, with heteropagus conjoined twinning and with other NTD-related embryonic malformations. Detailed genome-wide studies of children with dysraphic appendages are indicated.;Neural tube defect | Notomelia | Polymelia;4;0;;;;undefined;

A total of 141 schoolchildren participated in this cross-sectional study. Children were selected from two communities: one with a low (0.4 ppm) and the other with a high (1.8 ppm) water fluoride concentration. Dental fluorosis was evaluated by applying the Thylstrup and Fejerskov Index (TFI) criteria. Stimulated saliva was obtained, and fluoride concentration and GST activity were measured. The GST activity was compared among children with different levels of dental fluorosis using multinomial logistic regression models and odds ratios (OR). The mean age of the children was 10.6 (±1.03) years. Approximately half of the children showed dental fluorosis (52.5 %). The average GST activity was 0.5678 (±0.1959) nmol/min/μg. A higher concentration of fluoride in the saliva was detected in children with a higher GST activity (p = 0.039). A multinomial logistic regression model used to evaluate the GST activity and the dental fluorosis score identified a strong association between TFI = 2–3 (OR = 15.44, p = 0.007) and TFI ≥ 4 (OR = 55.40, p = 0.026) and the GST activity level, compared with children showing TFI = 0–1, adjusted for age and sex. Schoolchildren with higher levels of dental fluorosis and a higher fluoride concentration in the saliva showed greater GST activity. The increased GST activity most likely was the result of the body’s need to inactivate free radicals produced by exposure to fluoride.;Dental fluorosis | Fluorides | Glutathione S-transferase | Oxidative stress | Saliva;3;0;;;;undefined;

In this study, samples of sediment, invertebrate and algae were collected from the Providencia and Santa Catalina coral reef (Colombian Caribbean Sea) with the aim of isolating Actinobateria-like strain able to produce antimicrobial and quorum quenching compounds against pathogens. Several approaches were used to select actinobacterial isolates, obtaining 203 strains from all samples. According to their 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a total of 24 strains was classified within Actinobacteria represented by three genera: Streptomyces, Micromonospora, and Gordonia. In order to assess their metabolic profiles, the actinobacterial strains were grown in liquid cultures, and LC-MS-based analyses from ethyl acetate fractions were performed. Based on taxonomical classification, screening information of activity against phytopathogenic strains and quorum quenching activity, as well as metabolic profiling, six out of the 24 isolates were selected for follow-up with chemical isolation and structure identification analyses of putative metabolites involved in antimicrobial activities.;;38;1;repositoryam;Green;;1101-659-44402;Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS)

In this study, we investigated the effects of systemically applied oxytocin on the cardiorespiratory activity in a rodent model of moderate endotoxemia. Methods Telemetrically recorded electrocardiogram (ECGs) from animals which received lipopolysaccharide (LPS); oxytocin (Ox); lipopolysaccharide + oxytocin (LPS + Ox), or vehicle (V) were analyzed using the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) technique to estimate the respiratory rate. The mean R–R interval and the spectral parameters of heart rate variability (HRV), such as the natural logarithm of the high frequency (lnHF) and low frequency (lnLF) components were also estimated up to 24 h after treatment. Results The endotoxemic animals (LPS) showed an elevated respiratory rate as well as a reduced mean R–R interval, lnHF and lnLF components compared to controls (V) from +5 to +12 h after the treatment. The administration of oxytocin significantly attenuated the hyperventilation produced by the LPS-induced endotoxemia (LPS + Ox) and restored the values of the mean R–R interval and such spectral parameters at different time points. Conclusions Our results support the existence of a link among the respiratory, cardiovascular, and immune systems in which oxytocin seems to act as a potential cardioprotective peptide by favoring cardiac cholinergic autonomic coupling. As a result, oxytocin diminished animal's endotoxemic tachypnea and restored the cardiorespiratory interactions, which was indicated by the spectral components of HRV.";Anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway | ECG-derived respiration | HRV | LPS | Oxytocin;13;0;;;CONACYT;267761;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Experiment 1 consisted of two independent trials. In each trial, day-old broiler chicks were assigned to one of two groups: control + S. Enteritidis or probiotic + S. Enteritidis. At 72 h post-S. Enteritidis challenge, haematology and caecal content were evaluated for S. Enteritidis colonization. In Experiment 2, day-old broiler chicks were assigned to one of four groups: negative control; probiotic; control + S. Enteritidis; or probiotic + S. Enteritidis. At 72 h post-S. Enteritidis challenge, chickens in all groups were given an oral gavage dose of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d). In both trials of Experiment 1, a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in colony-forming units/gram of S. Enteritidis in caecal content and a reduction in the incidence of S. Enteritidis enriched caecal samples were observed in probiotic + S. Enteritidis chickens. In addition, significant heterophilia and lymphopaenia were observed in control + S. Enteritidis chickens. In Experiment 2, a decrease in numbers of S. Enteritidis in caeca were observed in probiotic + S. Enteritidis chickens when compared to control + S. Enteritidis. Also, an increase in serum FITC-d concentration was detected in control + S. Enteritidis. These results suggest that early infection with S. Enteritidis can increase intestinal permeability, but the adverse effects can be prevented by the administration of the probiotic tested.";Broiler | intestinal permeability | probiotic | Salmonella Enteritidis;34;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The objective of the present study was to determine the dietary and lifestyle behaviors among adolescents in Mexico City (CDMX) and the State of Michoacán. Methods: The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HSBC) survey was applied to 956 Mexican adolescents, who participated voluntarily, under the signing of an informed consent. Results: The adolescents of the CDMX show a greater consumption of sweetened beverages compared to those of Michoacán, which means that 94.2% and 91.44%, respectively, consume them regularly. The adolescents of the CDMX and Michoacán, report a low consumption of fruits represented by 16.3% and 14.86% respectively, and vegetables 10.3% and 16.00% respectively, consume them daily or more than one a day. We found a high percentage of students performing sedentary activities during the day. Conclusions: Low physical activity coupled with low consumption of fruits and vegetables and high consumption of soft drinks predisposes adolescents to present an increased risk of noncommunicable diseases.;Adolescents | Exercise | Food Habits;2;0;;;;undefined;

Salud ARTE is a school-based program, including supervised tooth brushing, implemented in 51 elementary schools in Mexico City. Objectives: To assess the three-month efficacy of supervised tooth brushing in reducing dental plaque, gingival inflammation, and bleeding on probing in schoolchildren participating in Salud ARTE. Study Design: This was a pragmatic cluster randomized intervention, with two parallel branches. Four randomly selected schools participating in Salud ARTE (n=200) and one control school, which did not participate in the program (CG) (n=50), were assessed. Clusters were not randomly allocated to intervention. The main outcomes were as follows: mean percentage gingival units with no inflammation, dental surfaces with no dental plaque, and gingival margins with no bleeding. The independent variable was supervised tooth brushing at school once a day after a meal. Guardians and children responded to a questionnaire on sociodemographic and oral hygiene practices, and children were examined dentally. Mean percentage differences were compared (baseline and follow-up). Results: A total of 75% of guardians from the intervention group (IG) and 77% from the CG answered the questionnaire. Of these, 89.3% were women, with a mean age of 36.9±8.5 years. No differences in sociodemographic variables were observed between groups, and 151 children from the IG and 35 from the CG were examined at baseline and follow-up. Mean percentage differences for plaque-free surfaces (8.8±28.5%) and healthy gingival units (23.3%±23.2%) were significantly higher in the IG. Conclusion: The school-supervised tooth brushing program is effective in improving oral hygiene and had a greater impact on plaque and gingivitis than on gingival bleeding.

It has been demonstrated and is widely accepted that CBZ is effective in the control of epileptic crises; unfortunately, there is scattered information concerning whether CBZ can aid in the sleep disorders produced by these crises. Because CBZ is one of the drugs that is most employed as an antiepileptic, it is important to analyze its effect on the electrical activity of the brain and sleep patterns under experimental and clinical conditions. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the administration of CBZ on the sleep patterns in a model of epilepsy induced by KA and its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlation. In this study, 40 male Wistar rats (weighing 250-280 g) were employed. Group 1 KA animals (n = 10) were chronically implanted with bipolar electrodes in the motor cortex, this to register cerebral activity (ElectroEncephaloGram [EEG]) and that of the neck muscles to obtain the muscular activity (ElectroMyoGram [EMG]). An electroencephalographic registry was taken from day 1 (Control); on day 2, Kainic Acid (KA) (10 mg/kg) was administered to induce the epileptic crisis and the registry continued for 5 additional days. Group 2 (CBZ+KA) animals (n = 10) followed the same chronic implantation of bipolar electrodes: day 1 (Control) was registered, and on Day 2, CBZ (25 mg/kg) was administered 30 min prior to the injection of KA, with the registry continuing for 3 additional days. Histological samples were obtained to evaluate the damage elicited by the drugs employed (n = 10). Group 3 animals (n = 10) were implanted with a cannula in the jugular vein to obtain the blood samples; a baseline sample was taken prior to the administration of CBZ (25 mg/kg), Subsequently, blood samples were taken at 10, 20, and 40 min and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h for the pharmacokinetic analysis. To assess the differences between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, a Student t test for unpaired samples was performed, and p < 0.05 was considered to denote a significant difference. To evaluate the differences between the groups of EEG, the data was analyzed by a one-way ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) (*p < 0.01 and **p < 0.001). The results showed a total absence of sleep during the first experimental day (Day 1) in Group 1 (KA), while in Group 2 (CBZ+KA), a partial recovery of Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) was also exhibited also during Day 1. Histological analysis revealed similar damage to that present in temporal-lobe epilepsy. The effect of CBZ was favorable, given that the crises significantly decreased when administered with CBZ, the latter demonstrated by comparison of the pharmacokinetics with the crisis. Conclusion. CBZ significantly decreases crises; however, only partial recovery of sleep is present and the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is the most damaged. A correlation was present between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of CBZ and its effect exerted on the sleep-wake cycle.";;0;0;;;;undefined;

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the load and unload deflection and permanent deformation of round 0.016′′ and rectangular 0.016′′×0.022′′ regular and coated Ni-Ti wires. Materials and Methods. Ni-Ti archwires produced by two manufacturers were evaluated. Both regular and coated round and rectangular Ni-Ti wire segments (n=15) from each group were submitted to a three-point bending test. Both types of wires were evaluated for permanent deformation at the end of a recovery cycle. Results. The coated round 0.016′′ Ni-Ti wires produced a significantly lower force in loading (p<0.01) and unloading (p<0.01) than regular wires of the same manufacturer and size. There was no significant difference in permanent deformation between coated and regular round Ni-Ti wires from the same company. For rectangular 0.016×0.022′′ Ni-Ti wires, there was a significant difference in the loading evaluation, but the unloading test presented no significant differences. The permanent deformation of the rectangular wires revealed no significant difference between them. Conclusion. The addition of an esthetic coating to these new Ni-Ti wires produced changes in their mechanical properties, manifested as a reduction in the applied force, which should be considered in clinical management.;;1;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Studies on this species have focused on the type of diet or as part of taxonomic reviews, while few reports are known on the morphological changes during its ontogeny. In this study the shape of C. riojai was evaluated by means of geometric morphometrics from hatchings up to 90 days-old individuals. Specimens of C. riojai were cultivated in controlled conditions, and 171 organisms there fixed, belonging to 11 age intervals included within five phases: free embryo, apterolarva, pterolarva, juvenile, and adult. There were used six landmarks in an initial configuration, and in a second configuration there were outlined two contours (dorsal and ventral) on the anterior region. A principal component analysis showed a strong differentiation in the shape during the transition larva-juvenile, for both an analysis of canonical variables found significant differences (ps<0.001) between the 11 age groups. The linear regression between the logarithm of the size centroid and procustes distances, showed that the individuals maintain a constant change in shape up to the end of the larval phase, at which time the youth stage begins and the changes in its shape decreases. The description of the early development of C. riojai without considering the development of the fins, shows that feature with greatest change is the movement of the anal pore, followed by the lengthening of the cephalic region. The size and shape of C. riojai during its early life could serve to differentiate developmental phases and could be used with other sister species to assess whether their shape is specific in each phase. The morphological changes of C. riojai during his early life could be described in a gradual form up to the the larval period, while saltatory in the change to juvenile.;Chirostoma | Early ontogy | Geometric morphometrics | Shape;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Yet, the effects of drinking by Mexican-origin individuals may differ between cities on versus off the border both in the United States and in Mexico. We characterize prior 12-month drinking patterns and examine their relationships with AUD, in border and off-border cities of Texas and adjacent Mexican states. Methods: Data come from the U.S.–Mexico Study of Alcohol and Related Conditions involving 2,336 Mexican Americans in Texas and 2,460 Mexicans in bordering states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas in Mexico. Drinking pattern was defined as an interaction between volume and maximum amount, or intensity (never vs. ever 5+/4+ [men/women], 8+, and 12+ drinks in a day). DSM-5 AUD was assessed using an adaptation of the Alcohol Section of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview core. Separately by gender, 5 logistic regressions models controlling for age were estimated predicting symptoms in 2 or more AUD criteria domains from volume, heavy pattern and, successively, effects of country, and (by country) residing on vs. off the border, or in each of 3 cities/country. Results: A segmentation analysis for Texas males based on rate of experiencing AUD generated several distinct volume groups, each partitioned by an empirically selected maximum, and helped identify a drinking-pattern typology. In gender-stratified models of AUD rates using this typology, adjusting for age, significant volume and intensity effects were seen, more strongly in the United States.

Conclusions: Drinking-pattern analyses confirm that border proximity may affect drinking problems but in opposite directions in the United States and Mexico, possibly related to economic and psychological stresses specific to respective communities.;Alcohol Dependence | Alcohol Drinking | Mexican Origin | Population Survey | U.S.–Mexico Border;7;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;P50AA005595;National Institutes of Health

Differences in DHA availability during specific developmental windows may program metabolic changes. Objective: We investigated the effects of maternal DHA supplementation during pregnancy on the nonfasting serum lipid and glucose concentrations of offspring at 4 y of age. Methods: We used data from the Prenatal Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation, Growth, and Development trial, a double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in Mexico. Pregnant women were supplemented daily with 400 mg DHA or placebo from 18-22 wk of gestation to delivery. The primary outcomes of the trial were offspring growth and neurological development. Nonfasting blood samples were obtained from the offspring at 4 y of age. We analyzed serum total, HDL, non-HDL, and LDL cholesterol; the total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio; apolipoprotein B (apoB); triglycerides; glucose; and insulin as secondary outcomes and compared their concentrations between treatment groups. Results: Data from 524 offspring were available. The women were compliant with the intervention based on pill counts and changes in cord blood and breast milk DHA concentrations. None of the between-group differences (DHA compared with placebo), adjusted for maternal height and time since last food intake, were significant (P range 0.27-0.83). Means (95% CIs) were as follows: total cholesterol (TC), 1.73 mg/dL (22.63, 6.09mg/dL); HDL cholesterol, 0.66 mg/dL (21.07, 2.39mg/dL); non- HDL cholesterol, 1.77mg/dL (21.83, 5.37 mg/dL); LDL cholesterol, 1.62mg/dL (22.21, 5.45mg/dL); TC:HDL ratio, 0.01 (20.09, 0.11); apoB,20.15 mg/dL (22.78, 2.48mg/dL); triglycerides, 0.21mg/dL (210.93, 10.52mg/dL); glucose,20.67mg/dL (22.46, 1.11 mg/dL); and insulin, 0.62 μU/mL (20.88, 2.11 μU/mL). Conclusion: Prenatal DHA supplementation does not affect nonfasting serum lipid and glucose concentrations of offspring at 4 y of age.

To identify objective and subjective conditions in the lives of pregnant teens within a highly-marginalized community in the state of Puebla, Mexico. Materials and methods. Objective and subjective conditions of pregnant teens were evaluated through a mixed methodology (surveys, observation guides and a structured interview guide). Results. The main family characteristic is the absence of a father due to migration, no desire to study or work and the new meaning of pregnancy: the initial social stigma for engaging in a sexual activity and then, the stigma for being a young mother. Conclusions. Objective conditions show family disintegration, lack of access to education at the community, high school and college level as well as unemployment as processes linked to teen pregnancy; thus, making it practically impossible to develop life goals.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Lean body mass was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. To define sarcopenia, the SMI was obtained using a cut-off value of 5.5 kg/m2, and the CC cut-off was 31 cm. For gait speed and handgrip strength, the cut-off values were 0.8 m/s and 20 kg, respectively. Results: A total of 137 women (mean age 73.8 ± 6.7 years) participated in the study. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 14.6% using SMI and 11.0% using CC (P = 0.009). Body mass index was associated with a lower probability of sarcopenia applying SMI or CC (OR 0.75, P = 0.002 for SMI and OR 0.71, P = 0.004 for CC). Sarcopenia evaluated either with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or CC was not associated with physical performance, such as five times chair stand test, timed up and go test and short physical performance battery. Additionally, SMI was not associated with physical performance, five times chair stand test (P = 0.775) and timed up-and-go test (P = 0.341). Conclusions: The prevalence of sarcopenia in active elderly women was low. A higher prevalence of sarcopenia was detected using SMI compared with CC. It is important to identify the best methods to assess skeletal muscle mass to obtain a reliable diagnosis of sarcopenia.

This study aimed to examine the association among depression symptoms, emotional eating, and body mass index (BMI) in Mexican college students; and to assess emotional eating as mediator between depressive symptoms and BMI. A total of 1453 students at a public university in Mexico City completed the scale Self-Efficacy in Emotion- and Stress- Related Eating of the Eating and Appraisal Due to Emotions and Stress Questionnaire (EADES) to assess emotional eating, and the scale created by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES-D) to identify depressive symptoms. Weight and height were measured to calculate BMI. Structural equation models (SEM) were used to assess emotional eating as mediator between depressive symptoms and BMI by sex. Depressive symptoms were associated with emotional eating in both men (Beta = −0.33, p < 0.001) and women (Beta = −0.46, p < 0.001). Emotional eating, in turn, was associated with BMI in men (Beta = −0.08, p < 0.001) as well as in women (Beta = −0.09, p < 0.001). Emotional eating was a mediator between depression and BMI, adjusted for age in both sexes.

LEV is a second-generation anti-epileptic drug (AED) that is approved for clinical use as monotherapy and may also be used for adjunctive treatment of patients with seizures. Several researchers have recommended LEV as a treatment option in different diseases causing neuronal damage, and recently, LEV has been used as an antihyperalgesic drug. LEV exhibits favorable characteristics, including a low potential for interaction, a short elimination half-life, and has neither active metabolites nor major negative effects on cognition. This has generated many new research avenues for the utilization of this drug. However, the precise mechanism of action of LEV has not been fully elucidated. In this review, a search was conducted on PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO, and the Science Citation index for studies evaluating the effects of LEV as an antiepileptic, neuroprotective, and hyperalgesic drug. A total of 32 studies related to the use of LEV suggested different mechanisms of action, such as binding to the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) protein, inhibition of Ca2+ N-type channels, and its presence as a neuromodulator. These studies concluded that the pharmacodynamics of LEV should be viewed as a single pathway, and should not be based on specific molecular targets that depend on the physiological or pathological conditions prevalent at that time.;Antiepileptic drug | epilepsy | hyperalgesic | levetiracetam | mechanism of action | neuronal damage;16;0;;;;undefined;

The graphical representation is susceptible to be parameterized in shape and orientation. The usefulness of this technique was studied on cardiovascular data from patients with vasovagal syncope (VVS) and from controls. The study included 15 female patients diagnosed with VVS and 11 age-matched healthy female subjects. All subjects were enrolled in a head-up tilt (HUT) test, breathing normally, including 5 minutes of supine position (baseline) and 18 minutes of 70° orthostatic phase. The DSPA parameters were obtained at different times during the HUT test, i.e., at baseline, early (first 5 min) and late (10-15 min) orthostatic phases. In baseline there were no considerable differences between female controls and female patients. During the late orthostatic phase, parameters from DSPA showed highly significantly (p=0.000003) reduced cardiovascular coupling in patients. Findings indicated a loss of control on cardiovascular coupling in female patients susceptible to vasovagal syncope during orthostatic challenge. In addition, this study provided promising results for a new graphical method to investigate cardiovascular coupling.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Consequently, to evaluate possible positive effects on patients of novel agents as pirfenidone is relevant. However, the efficacy of pirfenidone in CPFES patients is still not well-known. In this study we propose an alternative to evaluate the effects of pirfenidone treatment on CPFES patients via acoustic information. Quantitative analysis of discontinuous adventitious lung sounds (DLS), known as crackles, has been promising to detect and characterize diverse pulmonary pathologies. The present study combines independent components (ICs) analysis of LS and the automated selection of ICs associated with DLS. ICs's features as fractal dimension, entropy and sparsity produce several clusters by kmeans. Those clusters containing ICs of DLS are exclusively considered to finally estimate the number of DLS per ICs by a time-variant AR modeling. For the evaluation of the effects of pirfenidone, the 2D DLS-ICs spatial distribution in conjunction with the estimated number of DLS events are shown. The methodology is applied to two real cases of CPFES with 6 and 12 months of treatment. The acoustical evaluation indicates that pirfenidone treatment may not be satisfactory for CPFES patients but further evaluation has to be performed.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

By providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context. Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors—the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Findings Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25%. Global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased by more than 25% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57·8% (95% CI 56·6–58·8) of global deaths and 41·2% (39·8–42·8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211·8 million [192·7 million to 231·1 million] global DALYs), smoking (148·6 million [134·2 million to 163·1 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143·1 million [125·1 million to 163·5 million]), high BMI (120·1 million [83·8 million to 158·4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113·3 million [103·9 million to 123·4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103·1 million [90·8 million to 115·1 million]), high total cholesterol (88·7 million [74·6 million to 105·7 million]), household air pollution (85·6 million [66·7 million to 106·1 million]), alcohol use (85·0 million [77·2 million to 93·0 million]), and diets high in sodium (83·0 million [49·3 million to 127·5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Interpretation Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining. Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden.

We aimed to provide updated HALE and DALYs for geographies worldwide and evaluate how disease burden changes with development. Methods We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for each geography, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using the Sullivan method, which draws from age-specific death rates and YLDs per capita. We then assessed how observed levels of DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends calculated with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator constructed from measures of income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Findings Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2015, with decreases in communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional (Group 1) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Much of this epidemiological transition was caused by changes in population growth and ageing, but it was accelerated by widespread improvements in SDI that also correlated strongly with the increasing importance of NCDs. Both total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most Group 1 causes significantly decreased by 2015, and although total burden climbed for the majority of NCDs, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined. Nonetheless, age-standardised DALY rates due to several high-burden NCDs (including osteoarthritis, drug use disorders, depression, diabetes, congenital birth defects, and skin, oral, and sense organ diseases) either increased or remained unchanged, leading to increases in their relative ranking in many geographies. From 2005 to 2015, HALE at birth increased by an average of 2·9 years (95% uncertainty interval 2·9–3·0) for men and 3·5 years (3·4–3·7) for women, while HALE at age 65 years improved by 0·85 years (0·78–0·92) and 1·2 years (1·1–1·3), respectively. Rising SDI was associated with consistently higher HALE and a somewhat smaller proportion of life spent with functional health loss; however, rising SDI was related to increases in total disability. Many countries and territories in central America and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had increasingly lower rates of disease burden than expected given their SDI. At the same time, a subset of geographies recorded a growing gap between observed and expected levels of DALYs, a trend driven mainly by rising burden due to war, interpersonal violence, and various NCDs. Interpretation Health is improving globally, but this means more populations are spending more time with functional health loss, an absolute expansion of morbidity. The proportion of life spent in ill health decreases somewhat with increasing SDI, a relative compression of morbidity, which supports continued efforts to elevate personal income, improve education, and limit fertility. Our analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework on which to benchmark geography-specific health performance and SDG progress. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform financial and research investments, prevention efforts, health policies, and health system improvement initiatives for all countries along the development continuum.

The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures. Methods We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14 294 geography–year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61·7 years (95% uncertainty interval 61·4–61·9) in 1980 to 71·8 years (71·5–72·2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11·3 years (3·7–17·4), to 62·6 years (56·5–70·2). Total deaths increased by 4·1% (2·6–5·6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55·8 million (54·9 million to 56·6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17·0% (15·8–18·1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14·1% (12·6–16·0) to 39·8 million (39·2 million to 40·5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13·1% (11·9–14·3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42·1%, 39·1–44·6), malaria (43·1%, 34·7–51·8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29·8%, 24·8–34·9), and maternal disorders (29·1%, 19·3–37·1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000–183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000–532 000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death. Interpretation At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

The SDGs specify 17 universal goals, 169 targets, and 230 indicators leading up to 2030. We provide an analysis of 33 health-related SDG indicators based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015). Methods We applied statistical methods to systematically compiled data to estimate the performance of 33 health-related SDG indicators for 188 countries from 1990 to 2015. We rescaled each indicator on a scale from 0 (worst observed value between 1990 and 2015) to 100 (best observed). Indices representing all 33 health-related SDG indicators (health-related SDG index), health-related SDG indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG index), and health-related indicators not included in the MDGs (non-MDG index) were computed as the geometric mean of the rescaled indicators by SDG target. We used spline regressions to examine the relations between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI, a summary measure based on average income per person, educational attainment, and total fertility rate) and each of the health-related SDG indicators and indices. Findings In 2015, the median health-related SDG index was 59·3 (95% uncertainty interval 56·8–61·8) and varied widely by country, ranging from 85·5 (84·2–86·5) in Iceland to 20·4 (15·4–24·9) in Central African Republic. SDI was a good predictor of the health-related SDG index (r2=0·88) and the MDG index (r2=0·92), whereas the non-MDG index had a weaker relation with SDI (r2=0·79). Between 2000 and 2015, the health-related SDG index improved by a median of 7·9 (IQR 5·0–10·4), and gains on the MDG index (a median change of 10·0 [6·7–13·1]) exceeded that of the non-MDG index (a median change of 5·5 [2·1–8·9]). Since 2000, pronounced progress occurred for indicators such as met need with modern contraception, under-5 mortality, and neonatal mortality, as well as the indicator for universal health coverage tracer interventions. Moderate improvements were found for indicators such as HIV and tuberculosis incidence, minimal changes for hepatitis B incidence took place, and childhood overweight considerably worsened. Interpretation GBD provides an independent, comparable avenue for monitoring progress towards the health-related SDGs. Our analysis not only highlights the importance of income, education, and fertility as drivers of health improvement but also emphasises that investments in these areas alone will not be sufficient. Although considerable progress on the health-related MDG indicators has been made, these gains will need to be sustained and, in many cases, accelerated to achieve the ambitious SDG targets. The minimal improvement in or worsening of health-related indicators beyond the MDGs highlight the need for additional resources to effectively address the expanded scope of the health-related SDGs.

We aimed to quantify maternal mortality throughout the world by underlying cause and age from 1990 to 2015. Methods We estimated maternal mortality at the global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2015 for ages 10–54 years by systematically compiling and processing all available data sources from 186 of 195 countries and territories, 11 of which were analysed at the subnational level. We quantified eight underlying causes of maternal death and four timing categories, improving estimation methods since GBD 2013 for adult all-cause mortality, HIV-related maternal mortality, and late maternal death. Secondary analyses then allowed systematic examination of drivers of trends, including the relation between maternal mortality and coverage of specific reproductive health-care services as well as assessment of observed versus expected maternal mortality as a function of Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Findings Only ten countries achieved MDG 5, but 122 of 195 countries have already met SDG 3.1. Geographical disparities widened between 1990 and 2015 and, in 2015, 24 countries still had a maternal mortality ratio greater than 400. The proportion of all maternal deaths occurring in the bottom two SDI quintiles, where haemorrhage is the dominant cause of maternal death, increased from roughly 68% in 1990 to more than 80% in 2015. The middle SDI quintile improved the most from 1990 to 2015, but also has the most complicated causal profile. Maternal mortality in the highest SDI quintile is mostly due to other direct maternal disorders, indirect maternal disorders, and abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and/or miscarriage. Historical patterns suggest achievement of SDG 3.1 will require 91% coverage of one antenatal care visit, 78% of four antenatal care visits, 81% of in-facility delivery, and 87% of skilled birth attendance. Interpretation Several challenges to improving reproductive health lie ahead in the SDG era. Countries should establish or renew systems for collection and timely dissemination of health data; expand coverage and improve quality of family planning services, including access to contraception and safe abortion to address high adolescent fertility; invest in improving health system capacity, including coverage of routine reproductive health care and of more advanced obstetric care—including EmOC; adapt health systems and data collection systems to monitor and reverse the increase in indirect, other direct, and late maternal deaths, especially in high SDI locations; and examine their own performance with respect to their SDI level, using that information to formulate strategies to improve performance and ensure optimum reproductive health of their population.

For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015. Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identification and inclusion of additional studies published up to November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. Prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool first developed for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) and used it to compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores. Findings We generated 9·3 billion estimates from the various combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess of 1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17·2 billion, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 15·4–19·2 billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2·39 billion, 2·30–2·50 billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each affected more than 10% of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, iron-deficiency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss, migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment that affected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2·36 billion (2·35–2·37 billion) individuals affected. The second and third leading impairments by number of individuals affected were hearing loss and vision loss, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20–30% of total disability, largely attributable to nutritional deficiencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV/AIDS in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-deficiency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number of people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the epidemiological profile driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive approach of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between countries or subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or weakness of the estimates available.

October 2016;The Lancet;01406736;16590;1474547X;Journal;388;10053;;1725-1774;Background Established in 2000, Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) catalysed extraordinary political, financial, and social commitments to reduce under-5 mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. At the country level, the pace of progress in improving child survival has varied markedly, highlighting a crucial need to further examine potential drivers of accelerated or slowed decreases in child mortality. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides an analytical framework to comprehensively assess these trends for under-5 mortality, age-specific and cause-specific mortality among children under 5 years, and stillbirths by geography over time. Methods Drawing from analytical approaches developed and refined in previous iterations of the GBD study, we generated updated estimates of child mortality by age group (neonatal, post-neonatal, ages 1–4 years, and under 5) for 195 countries and territories and selected subnational geographies, from 1980–2015. We also estimated numbers and rates of stillbirths for these geographies and years. Gaussian process regression with data source adjustments for sampling and non-sampling bias was applied to synthesise input data for under-5 mortality for each geography. Age-specific mortality estimates were generated through a two-stage age–sex splitting process, and stillbirth estimates were produced with a mixed-effects model, which accounted for variable stillbirth definitions and data source-specific biases. For GBD 2015, we did a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in child mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and annualised rates of decrease for under-5 mortality and stillbirths as they related to the Soci-demographic Index (SDI). Second, we examined the ratio of recorded and expected levels of child mortality, on the basis of SDI, across geographies, as well as differences in recorded and expected annualised rates of change for under-5 mortality. Third, we analysed levels and cause compositions of under-5 mortality, across time and geographies, as they related to rising SDI. Finally, we decomposed the changes in under-5 mortality to changes in SDI at the global level, as well as changes in leading causes of under-5 deaths for countries and territories. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 child mortality estimation process, as well as data sources, in accordance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, 5·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5·7–6·0) children younger than 5 years died in 2015, representing a 52·0% (95% UI 50·7–53·3) decrease in the number of under-5 deaths since 1990. Neonatal deaths and stillbirths fell at a slower pace since 1990, decreasing by 42·4% (41·3–43·6) to 2·6 million (2·6–2·7) neonatal deaths and 47·0% (35·1–57·0) to 2·1 million (1·8-2·5) stillbirths in 2015. Between 1990 and 2015, global under-5 mortality decreased at an annualised rate of decrease of 3·0% (2·6–3·3), falling short of the 4·4% annualised rate of decrease required to achieve MDG4. During this time, 58 countries met or exceeded the pace of progress required to meet MDG4. Between 2000, the year MDG4 was formally enacted, and 2015, 28 additional countries that did not achieve the 4·4% rate of decrease from 1990 met the MDG4 pace of decrease. However, absolute levels of under-5 mortality remained high in many countries, with 11 countries still recording rates exceeding 100 per 1000 livebirths in 2015. Marked decreases in under-5 deaths due to a number of communicable diseases, including lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, and malaria, accounted for much of the progress in lowering overall under-5 mortality in low-income countries. Compared with gains achieved for infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies, the persisting toll of neonatal conditions and congenital anomalies on child survival became evident, especially in low-income and low-middle-income countries. We found sizeable heterogeneities in comparing observed and expected rates of under-5 mortality, as well as differences in observed and expected rates of change for under-5 mortality. At the global level, we recorded a divergence in observed and expected levels of under-5 mortality starting in 2000, with the observed trend falling much faster than what was expected based on SDI through 2015. Between 2000 and 2015, the world recorded 10·3 million fewer under-5 deaths than expected on the basis of improving SDI alone. Interpretation Gains in child survival have been large, widespread, and in many places in the world, faster than what was anticipated based on improving levels of development. Yet some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still had high rates of under-5 mortality in 2015. Unless these countries are able to accelerate reductions in child deaths at an extraordinary pace, their achievement of proposed SDG targets is unlikely. Improving the evidence base on drivers that might hasten the pace of progress for child survival, ranging from cost-effective intervention packages to innovative financing mechanisms, is vital to charting the pathways for ultimately ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

Studying the miRNome of locally advanced breast tumors we unsuspectedly found a dramatically repression of miR-204, a small non-coding RNA with no previous involvement in tumor angiogenesis. Downregulation of miR-204 was confirmed in an independent cohort of patients and breast cancer cell lines. Gain-of-function analysis indicates that ectopic expression of miR-204 impairs cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration, invasion, and the formation of 3D capillary networks in vitro. Likewise, in vivo vascularization and angiogenesis were suppressed by miR-204 in a nu/nu mice model. Genome-wide profiling of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing miR-204 revealed changes in the expression of hundred cancer-related genes. Of these, we focused on the study of pro-angiogenic ANGPT1 and TGFβR2. Functional analysis using luciferase reporter and rescue assays confirmed that ANGPT1 and TGFβR2 are novel effectors downstream of miR-204. Accordingly, an inverse correlation between miR-204 and ANGPT1/TGFβR2 expression was found in breast tumors. Knockdown of TGFβR2, but not ANGPT1, impairs cell proliferation and migration whereas inhibition of both genes inhibits angiogenesis. Taken altogether, our findings reveal a novel role for miR-204/ANGPT1/TGFβR2 axis in tumor angiogenesis. We propose that therapeutic manipulation of miR-204 levels may represent a promising approach in breast cancer.;;50;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Amebiasis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, considered the third leading cause of death in the world. The rats are used as a natural resistance model to amoebic liver infection. The aim of this study is to analyze the interaction of Entamoeba histolytica with neutrophils, macrophages, and NK cells in livers of intact and vagotomized rats. Six groups were studied (n = 4): Intact (I), Intact + amoeba (IA), Sham (S), Sham + amoeba (SA), Vagotomized (V) and Vagotomized + amoeba (VA). Animals were sacrificed at 8 h post-inoculation of E. histolytica. Then, livers were obtained and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue liver slides were stained with H-E, PAS and Masson. The best development time for E. histolytica infection was at 8 h. Amoeba was identified with a monoclonal anti-220 kDa E. histolytica lectin. Neutrophils (N) were identified with rabbit anti-human neutrophil myeloperoxidase, macrophages (Mɸ) with anti-CD68 antibody and NK cells (NK) with anti-NK. Stomachs weight and liver glycogen were higher in V. Collagen increased in VA, whereas vascular and neutrophilic areas were decreased. There were fewer N, Mɸ, NK around the amoeba in the following order IA > SA > VA (p < 0.05 between IA and VA). In conclusion, these results suggest that the absence of parasympathetic innervation affects the participation of neutrophils, macrophages and NK cells in the innate immune response, apparently by parasympathetic inhibition on the cellular functions and probably for participation in sympathetic activity.;Entamoeba histolytica | Inflammation | Macrophages | Neutrophil | Vagotomy;5;0;;;CONACYT;PIBB11-3;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In the past years craft beer sales have been growing faster than the dominant lager-style in countries with different beer tradition like Mexico and France. A change in consumption habits is a sign that the representation of the product is changing. It is, therefore, valuable to understand the elements and structure of this new representation. The present study was conducted to understand the impact of culture and consumption habits on beer representation. Three-hundred male consumers (craft and industrial beer users) were interviewed in Mexico and France. Participants were asked to perform: (1) free word association task using ""craft beer"" as inductor word, (2) ranking task of the evoked words based on their importance, and (3) valence rating task of each evoked word. Each word was characterized by a mean importance value and a frequency of elicitation to identify their role as central or peripheral elements in the representation. Results showed that consumers from same culture share similar social representations of craft beer, even when they have different consumption habits (craft-industrial). Mexican consumers share alcohol, and flavour as central elements in their representations but share only one peripheral element ""tradition"". French consumers share two central elements taste and party. When comparing consumers across cultures, French and Mexican craft participants share no central elements in their representations towards beer; whereas industrial beer consumers share one element ""alcohol"". Craft consumers seem to have a more structured social representation, sustained or nourished on consumption habits, whilst the representation of industrial beer consumers seems less resistant, or capable of changing over time.";Craft beer | Cross-cultural | Drinking experience | France | Mexico | Social representation;54;0;;;;undefined;

CGTase production, mainly by Bacillus sp., depends on fermentation conditions such as pH, temperature, concentration of nutrients, carbon and nitrogen sources, among others. Bacillus megaterium CGTase produces those three types of CDs, however, β-CD should prevail. Although, waxy corn starch (CS) is used industrially to obtain CGTase and CDs because of its high amylopectin content, alternative sources such as amaranth starch (AS) could be used to accomplish those purposes. AS has high susceptibility to the amylolytic activity of CGTase because of its 80% amylopectin content. Therefore, the aim of this work was evaluate the AS as carbon source for CGTase production by B. megaterium in a submerged fermentation. Afterwards, the CGTase was purified partially and its activity to synthesize α-, β-, and γ-CDs was evaluated using 1% AS as substrate. B. megaterium produced a 66 kDa CGTase (Topt = 50°C; pHopt = 8.0), from the early exponential growth phase which lasted 36 h. The maximum CGTase specific activity (106.62 ± 8.33 U/mg protein) was obtained after 36 h of culture. CGTase obtained with a Km = 0.152 mM and a Vmax = 13.4 μM/min yielded 40.47% total CDs using AS which was roughly twice as much as that of corn starch (CS; 24.48%). High costs to produce CDs in the pharmaceutical and food industries might be reduced by using AS because of its higher α-, β- and γ-CDs production (12.81, 17.94, and 9.92%, respectively) in a shorter time than that needed for CS.";Amaranth starch | Bacillus megaterium | CGTase | Cyclodextrin | Submerged fermentation;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the risks involved in the use of Enrofloxacin for SE or SH in commercial poultry. Experiment 1 consisted of two trials. In each trial, chickens were assigned to one of three groups; control + SE challenged; Enrofloxacin 25 mg/kg + SE; and Enrofloxacin 50 mg/kg + SE. Chickens received Enrofloxacin in the drinking water from days 1 to 5 of age. On day 6, all groups received fresh water without any treatment. All chickens were orally gavaged with 107 cfu/chick of SE at 7 days of age and euthanized on 8 days of age. In Experiment 2, turkey poults were assigned to one of the three groups; control + SH; probiotic + SH; and Enrofloxacin 50 mg/kg + SH. Poults received probiotic or Enrofloxacin in the drinking water from days 1 to 5 of age. On day 6, poults received fresh water without any treatment. Poults were orally gavaged with 107 cfu/poult of SH at 7 days of age. Poults were weighed and humanely killed 24 h post-SH challenge to evaluate serum concentration of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran to evaluate intestinal permeability, metagenomics, and SH infection. In both trials of Experiment 1, chickens treated with Enrofloxacin were more susceptible to SE organ invasion and intestinal colonization when compared with control non-treated chickens (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, poults treated with 50 mg/kg of Enrofloxacin showed an increase in body weight, however, this group also showed an increase in SH susceptibility, intestinal permeability, and lower proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, but with control group had the highest proportion of Proteobacteria. By contrast, poults that received the probiotic had the highest proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, but lowest Proteobacteria. The results of the present study suggest that prophylactic utilization of Enrofloxacin at five times the recommended dose in poultry increases the susceptibility to salmonellae infections, and confirms that probiotics may be an effective tool in salmonellae infections.";Enrofloxacin | Metagenomics | Poultry | Salmonella | Susceptibility;13;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

However, results from the U.S.–Mexico Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions (UMSARC) revealed surprisingly large variation in alcohol outcomes even among Texas border sites, with alcohol use disorder (AUD) prevalence ~1.5 to 1.6 times greater in the border city of Laredo compared to both San Antonio and the border site of McAllen/Brownsville. Because a better understanding of this variation is important to identifying environmental influences on AUD, we developed and tested a conceptual model addressing variation in AUD prevalence across Texas UMSARC sites. Methods: Surveys involved in-person, household interviews with Mexican-origin residents of the Texas border cities Laredo (n = 751) and McAllen/Brownsville (n = 814), with San Antonio as an off-border comparison (n = 771). Interviews assessed past-year DSM-5 AUD; past-year heavy drinking; coping and enhancement motives; and 7 indicators of substance use climate and stress exposure hypothesized to mediate site effects. Analyses, conducted separately by gender, included regressions and structural equation modeling with Mplus. Results: Preliminary analyses revealed that site effects on AUD prevalence were, unexpectedly, exclusive to men, and that Laredan men were similar to McAllen/Brownsville men on demographics, acculturation, and cross-border mobility. However, sites differed dramatically on most of the hypothesized risk factors. Structural equation models confirmed that site effects on AUD were partially mediated via effects of site on indicators of a permissive climate (i.e., permissive drinking norms, high drug availability) and stress exposures (i.e., high exposure to violence/crime, low family support), and via downstream effects on drinking motives and heavy drinking. Conclusions: Findings of very high rates of past-12-month AUD among Laredan men (35%) suggest the possibility of significant heterogeneity even within demographically similar border areas and underline the need for additional study of the border region. Findings regarding our conceptual model suggest that this model may constitute a useful initial framework for future research on alcohol problems at the border. However, additional research using representative samples is needed to confirm and expand this model to comprehensively address relevant individual and community factors.";Alcohol Dependence | Disparities | Hispanic | Immigration | Latino;16;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;P50AA005595;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

In this report from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we provide national estimates of levels and trends of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and mortality for 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. Methods For countries without high-quality vital registration data, we estimated prevalence and incidence with data from antenatal care clinics and population-based seroprevalence surveys, and with assumptions by age and sex on initial CD4 distribution at infection, CD4 progression rates (probability of progression from higher to lower CD4 cell-count category), on and off antiretroviral therapy (ART) mortality, and mortality from all other causes. Our estimation strategy links the GBD 2015 assessment of all-cause mortality and estimation of incidence and prevalence so that for each draw from the uncertainty distribution all assumptions used in each step are internally consistent. We estimated incidence, prevalence, and death with GBD versions of the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) and Spectrum software originally developed by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). We used an open-source version of EPP and recoded Spectrum for speed, and used updated assumptions from systematic reviews of the literature and GBD demographic data. For countries with high-quality vital registration data, we developed the cohort incidence bias adjustment model to estimate HIV incidence and prevalence largely from the number of deaths caused by HIV recorded in cause-of-death statistics. We corrected these statistics for garbage coding and HIV misclassification. Findings Global HIV incidence reached its peak in 1997, at 3·3 million new infections (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1–3·4 million). Annual incidence has stayed relatively constant at about 2·6 million per year (range 2·5–2·8 million) since 2005, after a period of fast decline between 1997 and 2005. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS has been steadily increasing and reached 38·8 million (95% UI 37·6–40·4 million) in 2015. At the same time, HIV/AIDS mortality has been declining at a steady pace, from a peak of 1·8 million deaths (95% UI 1·7–1·9 million) in 2005, to 1·2 million deaths (1·1–1·3 million) in 2015. We recorded substantial heterogeneity in the levels and trends of HIV/AIDS across countries. Although many countries have experienced decreases in HIV/AIDS mortality and in annual new infections, other countries have had slowdowns or increases in rates of change in annual new infections. Interpretation Scale-up of ART and prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been one of the great successes of global health in the past two decades. However, in the past decade, progress in reducing new infections has been slow, development assistance for health devoted to HIV has stagnated, and resources for health in low-income countries have grown slowly. Achievement of the new ambitious goals for HIV enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 3 and the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets will be challenging, and will need continued efforts from governments and international agencies in the next 15 years to end AIDS by 2030.

However, no data about the expression of this protein in oral melanocytic lesions are available to date. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 in oral nevi and melanomas, comparing the results with correspondent cutaneous lesions. Methods: COX-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 49 oral melanocytic lesions, including 36 intramucosal nevi and 13 primary oral melanomas, and in four cutaneous nevi and eight melanomas. Results: All cases of oral and cutaneous melanomas were positive for COX-2. On the other hand, all oral and cutaneous melanocytic nevi were negative. Conclusion: COX-2 is highly positive in oral melanomas and negative in oral nevi and might represent a useful marker to distinguish melanocytic lesions of the oral cavity.;cutaneous melanocytic nevi | cutaneous melanoma | cyclooxygenase-2 | intramucosal melanocytic nevi | oral melanoma;9;0;;;;undefined;

The aims of this study were to describe (a) the AOO distribution of PEs, (b) the projected lifetime risk of PEs, and (c) the associations of PE AOO with selected PE features. Methods: Data came from the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) surveys. A total of 31 261 adult respondents across 18 countries were assessed for lifetime prevalence of PE. Projected lifetime risk (at age 75 years) was estimated using a 2-part actuarial method. AOO distributions were described for the observed and projected estimates. We examined associations of AOO with PE type metric and annualized PE frequency. Results: Projected lifetime risk for PEs was 7.8% (SE = 0.3), slightly higher than lifetime prevalence (5.8%, SE = 0.2). The median (interquartile range; IQR) AOO based on projected lifetime estimates was 26 (17-41) years, indicating that PEs commence across a wide age range. The AOO distributions for PEs did not differ by sex. Early AOO was positively associated with number of PE types (F = 14.1, P < .001) but negatively associated with annualized PE frequency rates (F = 8.0, P < .001). Discussion: While most people with lifetime PEs have first onsets in adolescence or young adulthood, projected estimates indicate that nearly a quarter of first onsets occur after age 40 years. The extent to which late onset PEs are associated with (a) late onset mental disorders or (b) declining cognitive and/or sensory function need further research.";Age of onset | Epidemiology | Lifetime prevalence | Psychotic experiences | World Mental Health Survey;72;1;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

The tannins extract was from Bypro® (Silvafeed, Indunor, S.A., Argentina) containing 70 % of tannins. The bulls were slaughtered in a TIF plant No. 99. At 24 h post-slaughter four samples (2.5 cm thick) were taken at the level of the 12th and 13th rib of the left middle carcass. Physical characteristics and sensory profile, as well as, the perception and acceptance of the meat by consumers were evaluated. Tannins did not influence the physical characteristics of the meat (P>0.05). The sensory profile was not influenced by treatments (P>0.05).

The study population comprised subjects aged ≥18 years from 11 communities in the municipality of Chankom, Yucatan. An analytical cross-sectional study was performed, and a census was used. Subjects positive for musculoskeletal (MSK) pain were examined by trained physicians. A total of 1523 community members were interviewed. The mean age was 45.2 years (standard deviation (SD) 17.9), and 917 (60.2 %) were women. Overall, 592 individuals (38.8 %; 95 % CI 36.3–41.3 %) had experienced MSK pain in the last 7 days. The pain intensity was reported as “strong” to “severe” in 43.4 %. The diagnoses were rheumatic regional pain syndromes in 165 (10.8 %; 95 % CI 9.4–12.5), low back pain in 153 (10.0 %; 95 % CI 8.5–11.6), osteoarthritis in 144 (9.4 %; 95 % CI 8.0–11.0), fibromyalgia in 35 (2.2 %; 95 % CI 1.6–3.1), rheumatoid arthritis in 17 (1.1 %; 95 % CI 0.6–1.7), undifferentiated arthritis in 8 (0.5 %; 95 % CI 0.2–0.8), and gout in 1 (0.06 %; 95 % CI 0.001–0.3). Older age, being female, disability, and physically demanding work were associated with a greater likelihood of having a rheumatic disease. In conclusion, MSK pain and rheumatic diseases were highly prevalent.

To this end, 565 surveys were applied to make a detailed inquiry of sociodemographic information and describe their production systems. An intensive and inappropriate use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides was identified in the three production systems. Generally, flower and vegetable producers used insecticides that fall in Toxicological Category (TC) I and II, and fungicides that correspond to TC IV. Maize producers frequently use herbicides TC II, III and IV and insecticides TC I. The factors that explain the use of pesticides are related to the production system, the agricultural area, the frequency and crop cycles per year, the diversity of problems and availability of funds. The monetary resources coming from governmental programs are used for the purchase of pesticides in the three systems. It is necessary that the different social actors involved in the rural sector develop comprehensive integral strategies of action to promote the conversion of these conventional systems into low-input systems ones, with the tendency agricultural practices are environmentally friendly.;;7;0;;;;undefined;

However,resistance to chemotherapy and to specific small molecule inhibitors is common in cancer patients; thus alternative therapeutic approaches are needed to overcome clinical resistance. Here,we showed that the dietary compound resveratrol suppressed the cell cycle by targeting AURKA and PLK1 kinases. First,we identified genes modulated by resveratrol using a genome-wide analysis of gene expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Transcriptional profiling indicated that 375 genes were modulated at 24 h after resveratrol intervention,whereas 579 genes were regulated at 48 h. Of these,290 genes were deregulated in common at 24 and 48 h. Interestingly,a significant decrease in the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle,DNA repair,cytoskeleton organization,and angiogenesis was detected. In particular,AURKA and PLK1 kinases were downregulated by resveratrol at 24 h. In addition the BRCA1 gene,an AURKA/PLK1 inhibitor,was upregulated at 24 h of treatment. Moreover,two wellknown resveratrol effectors,cyclin D1 (CCND1) and cyclin B1 (CCNB1),were also repressed at both times. Congruently,we found that resveratrol impaired G1/S phase transition in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. By western blot assays,we confirmed that resveratrol suppressed AURKA,CCND1 and CCNB1 at 24 and 48 h. In summary,we showed for the first time that resveratrol regulates cell cycle progression by targeting AURKA and PLK1. Our findings highlight the potential use of resveratrol as an adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.";AURKA | BRCA1 | Breast cancer | Cell cycle | PLK1 | Resveratrol | Transcriptome;35;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Methods The English language literature on Medline, PsychInfo, Google Scholar, and public-use databases was searched for original articles, critical review reports, and public use data on cannabis use and suicide for the period ranging from 1990-2015 (February). Odds ratios (OR) from random effects in meta-analyses for any cannabis use and heavy cannabis use were calculated. Results The acute cannabis-suicidality literature mostly includes descriptive toxicology reports. In terms of death by suicide, the average positive cannabis rate was 9.50% for studies sampling from all suicides, with higher cannabis detection rates amongst suicide decedents by non-overdose methods. We found only 4 studies providing estimates for any chronic cannabis use and death by suicide (OR=2.56 (1.25-5.27)). After deleting duplicates we found 6 studies on any cannabis use and suicide ideation (OR=1.43 (1.13-1.83)), 5 studies on heavy cannabis use and suicide ideation (OR=2.53 (1.00-6.39)), 6 studies on any cannabis use and suicide attempt (OR=2.23 (1.24-4.00)) and 6 studies on heavy cannabis use and suicide attempt (OR=3.20 (1.72-5.94)). Conclusions We currently lack evidence that acute cannabis use increases imminent risk for suicidality. The evidence tends to support that chronic cannabis use can predict suicidality, but the lack of homogeneity in the measurement of cannabis exposure and, in some instances, the lack of systematic control for known risk factors tempered this finding.;;114;0;;;;undefined;

A standardized CPA template with node-specific recommendations to assist the local transculturalization process is provided. Participants unanimously agreed on the following five overarching principles for LA: (1) there is only one level of optimal endocrine care, (2) hemoglobin A1C should be utilized at every level of diabetes care, (3) nutrition education and increased pharmaceutical options are necessary to optimize the obesity care model, (4) quality neck ultrasound must be part of an optimal thyroid nodule care model, and (5) more scientific evidence is needed on osteoporosis prevalence and cost to justify intervention by governmental health care authorities.

Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out that included 80 children residing in a community with high concentrations of fluoride in the drinking water. To determine whether the presence of this polymorphism and dental fluorosis are associated, the presence of the dental fluorosis was considered to be a response variable, while fluoride concentration in water and urine was designated as independent variables. In addition, the children's parents completed questionnaires with general information about drinking and cooking with tap water, consumption of milk and soft drinks, and other putative risk factors. Results Individuals with the polymorphism had nonsignificant odds (OR = 2.24; 95% CI = 0.55-9.02) of having dental fluorosis at higher exposures to fluoride. This finding was similar in individuals without the polymorphism (OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 0.44-6.17).

In this study, dynamics of autonomic response to an orthostatic challenge was investigated by hemodynamic variables and by diverse linear and nonlinear indices calculated from time series of beat-to-beat intervals (BBI), respiratory cycle duration (RESP), systolic (SYS) and diastolic (DIA) blood pressure. This study included 16 young female patients (SYN) with vasovagal syncope and 12 age-matched female controls (CON). The subjects were enrolled in a head-up tilt (HUT) test, breathing normally, including 5 min of baseline (BL, supine position) and 18 min of 70° orthostatic phase (OP). To increase the time resolution of the analysis the time series were segmented in five-minute overlapping windows with a shift of 1 min. Hemodynamic parameters did not show any statistical differences between SYN and CON. Time domain linear analysis revealed increased respiratory frequency and increased blood pressure variability (BPV) in patients during OP meaning increased sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal. Frequency domain analysis confirmed a predominance of sympathetic tone by steadily increased values of low over high frequency power in BBI and of low frequency power in SYS and DIA in patients during OP. The nonlinear analysis by symbolic dynamics seemed to be highly suitable for differentiation of SYN and CON in the early beginning of OP, i.e., 5 min after tilt-up. In particular the index SYS_plvar3 showed less patterns of low variability in patients reflecting a steadily increase in both BPV and sympathetic activity. The proposed dynamical analysis could lead to a better understanding of the temporal underlying mechanisms in healthy subjects and patients under orthostatic stress.;Autonomic regulation | Blood pressure variability | Heart rate variability | Nonlinear dynamics | Orthostatic stress | Respiratory cycle;15;0;;;;undefined;

We also assessed the correlations between BRS and the spectral measures of autonomic activity. Instantaneous values of RR, HFRR, BRS and RSAS presented characteristic response patterns of overshoot in CFT, and of undershoot of the four variables in AOT. BRS was positively correlated with HFRR (0.85±0.14), RSAS (0.76±0.11) and RR (0.87±0.11), and negatively with LFsp (-0.81±0.09) and LFrr/HFrr (-0.77±0.13). In a beat-to-beat format BRS, HFrr, RSAS, LFSP and RR: exhibit great dynamism, are strongly correlated, and follow distinctive opposite patterns in response to each maneuver. While in CFT the greater values of BRS and RSAS allow amplifying the vagal activity and minimizing the sympathetic outflow, in AOT the lower values of BRS and RSAS determine the opposite autonomic effects. The tight correlations suggest that both BRS and RSAS operate to reciprocally strengthen and inhibit the sympathetic and vagal activities.;;1;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Short-time hyperoxemia provoked various effects with different latencies: a) RR lengthening, with 15-s latency; b) AP increase, with 75-s latency, c) BRS and RSAS increases with 120-s latency, d) HFrr increase and LFSP and LFrr/HFrr decreases, with 135-s latency, and d) no significant changes on Res. During hyperoxemia, the instantaneous time courses of these variables are fluctuating, with subtle yet significant changes at different latencies. Initially, hyperoxemia lengthens RR by direct inhibition of the sinoatrial node, and later on, it elicits a direct vasoconstriction-dependent increment of AP, which, via baroreflex with augmented sensitivity, increases vagal outflow and reduces sympathetic activity, changes strengthened by the augmented RSAS, but hyperoxemia does not modify the respiratory variables.";;0;0;;;;undefined;

In order to maintain high levels of ACS it is important to understand correlates of ACS in this population. However, most evidence comes from high-income countries (HICs). We examined multilevel correlates of ACS in children attending public schools in 3 Mexican cities. Methods: Information on 1191 children (grades 3 to 5) attending 26 schools was retrieved from questionnaires, neighborhood audits, and geographic information systems data. Multilevel logistic modeling was used to explore individual and environmental correlates of ACS at 400-m and 800-m buffers surrounding schools. Results: Individual positive correlates for ACS included age (6-8 years vs 9-11 years, odds ratio [OR] = 1.5; 6-8 years vs ≥12 years: OR = 2.1) and ≥ 6 adults at home (OR = 2.0). At the 400-m buffer, more ACS was associated with lower walkability (OR = 0.87), presence of posted speed limits (< 6% vs > 12%: OR = 0.36) and crossing aids (< 6% vs 6-20%: OR = 0.25; > 20%: OR = 0.26), as well as higher sidewalk availability (< 70% vs > 90%: OR = 4.5). Similar relationships with speed limits and crossing aids were observed at the 800m buffer. Conclusions: Findings contrast with those reported in HICs, underscoring the importance of considering the local context when developing strategies to promote ACS. Future studies are needed to replicate these relationships and investigate the longitudinal impact of improving active transportation infrastructure and policies.";Active transport | Built environment | Obesity | Pediatrics | Physical activity;15;0;;;NCI;R13CA162816;National Cancer Institute

Especially, the temporal development of the autonomic regulation has not yet been explicitly analyzed using short-term segments in supine position, transition and orthostatic phase (OP). In this study, nonlinear analysis of cardiovascular and respiratory time series was performed to investigate how nonlinear indices are dynamically changing with respect to gender during orthostatic challenges. The analysis was carried out using shifted short-term segments throughout a head-up tilt test in 24 healthy subjects, 12 men (26 ± 4 years) and 12 age-matched women (26 ± 5 years), at supine position and during OP at 70°. The nonlinear methods demonstrated statistical differences in the autonomic regulation between males and females. Orthostatic stress caused significantly decreased heart rate variability due to increased sympathetic activity mainly in men, already at the beginning and during the complete OP, revealed by (a) increased occurrence of specific word types with constant fluctuations as pW111 from symbolic dynamics, (b) augmented fractal correlation properties by the short-term index alpha1 from detrended fluctuation analysis, (c) increased slope indices (21ati and 31ati) from auto-transinformation and (d) augmented time irreversibility indices demonstrating more temporal asymmetries and nonlinear dynamics in men than in women. After tilt-up, both men and women increased their sympathetic activity but in a different way. Time-dependent gender differences during orthostatic challenge were shown directly between men and women or indirectly comparing baseline and different temporal stages of OP. The proposed dynamical study of autonomic regulation has the advantage of screening the fluctuations of the sympathetic and vagal activities that can be quantified by the temporal behavior of nonlinear indices. The findings in this paper strongly suggest the need for gender separation in studies of the dynamics of autonomic regulation during orthostatic challenge.;Autonomic regulation | heart rate variability | nonlinear dynamics | orthostatic stress;15;0;;;;undefined;

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS for T2D in the Japanese population. Combined data from discovery and subsequent validation analyses (23,399 T2D cases and 31,722 controls) identify 7 new loci with genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10-8), rs1116357 near CCDC85A, rs147538848 in FAM60A, rs1575972 near DMRTA1, rs9309245 near ASB3, rs67156297 near ATP8B2, rs7107784 near MIR4686 and rs67839313 near INAFM2. Of these, the association of 4 loci with T2D is replicated in multi-ethnic populations other than Japanese (up to 65,936 T2Ds and 158,030 controls, P<0.007). These results indicate that expansion of single ethnic GWAS is still useful to identify novel susceptibility loci to complex traits not only for ethnicity-specific loci but also for common loci across different ethnicities.;;105;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;BC050791;National Institutes of Health

In this protozoan, heterogeneity in DNA content, polyploidy and genome plasticity have been associated to alterations in mechanisms controlling DNA replication and cell division. Studying the function of the transcription factor EhPC4, we unexpectedly found that it is functionally related to DNA replication, and multinucleation. Site-directed mutagenesis on the FRFPKG motif revealed that the K 127 residue is required for efficient EhPC4 DNA-binding activity. Remarkably, overexpression of EhPC4 significantly increased cell proliferation, DNA replication and DNA content of trophozoites. A dramatically increase in cell size resulting in the formation of giant multinucleated trophozoites (polykaryon) was also found. Multinucleation event was associated to cytokinesis failure leading to abortion of ongoing cell division. Consistently, genome-wide profiling of EhPC4 overexpressing trophozoites revealed the up-regulation of genes involved in carbohydrates and nucleic acids metabolism, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Forced overexpression of one of these genes, EhNUDC (nuclear movement protein), led to alterations in cytokinesis and partially recapitulated the multinucleation phenotype.

In some parental care strategies, parents promote recognition of their own young in order to ensure their survival by providing them - and only them - with food, while the young simultaneously learn features of the environment. In the specific case of sheep, mother-young bonding is established during the sensitive period of the first 4 h after birth. The ewe prints a distinctive signal on her lambs that marks her as the legitimate mother, while stimulating the offspring's learning processes through olfactory, visual and acoustic cues. However, the sensory basis for proximal recognition of lambs changes over time as they learn to recognise the signals emitted by the mother. After 4 h - or less - the ewe becomes maternally selective; this means that she accepts only her own lambs at the udder, while actively rejecting alien newborns. Likewise, newborn lambs develop a preference for their mothers in less than one day. This preference is regulated by the difference between the acceptance behaviour manifested by the lamb's own mother and the aggressive rejecting behaviour shown by alien ewes. This early discriminative ability allows the lamb to avoid the aggressive actions of alien dams and maintain close contact with its own lactating mother. At around one week of age, lambs learn to develop the sensory cues that allow them to recognize their mother. These include olfactory, visual, acoustic and tactile information. Mutual ewe-lamb recognition at an early age also ensures that newborns will be fed and cared for by their own mother, which satisfies some of the requirements for their survival and welfare. For all these reasons, any disruption of ewe-lamb bonding during parturition is detrimental to lamb welfare and survival.";Ewe-lamb bond | Olfactory | Recognition | Vision | Vocalisation | Welfare;20;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

These networks oscillate since early life and are modulated by diverse maturation factors, including educational processes. Objective: To identify the power spectrum separated in delta (d), theta (?), alpha 1 (a1), alpha 2 (a2), beta 1 (ß1), beta 2 (ß2), and their topography in cerebral hemispheres of children, youngsters, and adults to establish qEEG indicators. Method: We studied three groups of 16 participants each: elementary school children (CG), undergraduate students (UG), and graduate students (GG). Parents and participants granted their consent. The EEG was recorded (Nicolet) following the 10/20 system. Bipolar samples were analyzed. Absolute power (AP) was obtained with Fourier transform; its average (AAP) relative power (RP), and slow/fast frequencies and indices were calculated. Differences were assessed with Kruskal Wallis and Dunnet&#39;s comparison for subgroups. Results: The AAP of six frequencies was higher in CG than in UG and GG. Frequencies were similar with exceptions correlating with topographic distribution. The d/a index was higher in CG with a particular topographic distribution, ?/a varied more. RP of a was higher in UG and GG than in CG; that of ? and d were higher in some leads of CG. Discussion and conclusion: During cerebral maturation, AP diminishes due to integration of more glial-neuronal ensembles, presenting greater asymmetry in a giving frequency. These profiles establish indicators for comparison with future EEG recordings.";;0;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

Case report: We report here the case of a 6-day-old presenting a mass extending at the level of the occipital bone. This mass is developed in the extracranial region and contains two forelimbs including hands with digits. CT shows that the squamous part of the occipital bone is involved with several defects through which a part of the cerebellum herniates. The boy was operated on and the tumor was removed. The herniated region of the cerebellum has also been removed. After surgery, the boy develops normally. Conclusion: This type of tumor is extremely rare and is only the second case that has been reported at this exact location. This could be the so-called céphalomélie described by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in a duck in his famous Treatise of Teratology (1836). The cause of this malformation is still a matter for debate.;Cephaloceles | Cephalomelia | Niger;2;0;;;;undefined;

Methods. We performed a cross-sectional survey of 2336 Mexican Americans and 2460 Mexicans in 3 Texas border metropolitan areas and their sister cities in Mexico (the US-Mexico Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions, 2011-2013). We collected prevalence and risk factors for alcohol and drug use; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, alcohol-use disorders; and 2 symptoms (hazardous use and quit or control) of drug use disorder across a continuum of migration experiences in the Mexican and Mexican American populations. Results. Compared with Mexicans with no migrant experience, the adjusted odds ratios for this continuum of migration experiences ranged from 1.10 to 8.85 for 12-month drug use, 1.09 to 5.07 for 12-month alcohol use disorder, and 1.13 to 9.95 for 12-month drug-use disorder. Odds ratios increased with longer exposure to US society. These findings are consistent with those of 3 previous studies. Conclusions.

The system allows monitoring wirelessly through two modules: movement patterns and physiological markers of the patient. The first module is open technology based as is Raspberry Pi and Open CV to process images to identify movement patterns. The second module uses an Arduino pro mini with temperature and pulse sensor to logging information of the physiological data (heart rate and temperature). The information obtained is processed on a Web server through an application for viewing in a Web page or mobile device. With this information the attending physician or can correlate the variability of heart rate, temperature and movement pattern and determine by monitoring the state of the Depression in Elderly. This system is designed to send alert messages via MSN to physician and family in emergency situations such as extreme temperatures, irregular heartbeat, and absence or excess movement.;Detection | Elderly | Major depression | Open hardware;1;0;;;;undefined;

Risk factor quantification, particularly of modifiable risk factors, can help to identify emerging threats to population health and opportunities for prevention. The GBD 2013 provides a timely opportunity to update the comparative risk assessment with new data for exposure, relative risks, and evidence on the appropriate counterfactual risk distribution. Methods: Attributable deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) have been estimated for 79 risks or clusters of risks using the GBD 2010 methods. Risk-outcome pairs meeting explicit evidence criteria were assessed for 188 countries for the period 1990-2013 by age and sex using three inputs: risk exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). Risks are organised into a hierarchy with blocks of behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks at the first level of the hierarchy. The next level in the hierarchy includes nine clusters of related risks and two individual risks, with more detail provided at levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchy. Compared with GBD 2010, six new risk factors have been added: handwashing practices, occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, childhood wasting, childhood stunting, unsafe sex, and low glomerular filtration rate. For most risks, data for exposure were synthesised with a Bayesian metaregression method, DisMod-MR 2.0, or spatial-temporal Gaussian process regression. Relative risks were based on meta-regressions of published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on the mediation of some risks such as high body-mass index (BMI) through other risks such as high systolic blood pressure and high cholesterol. Findings: All risks combined account for 57·2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 55·8-58·5) of deaths and 41·6% (40·1-43·0) of DALYs. Risks quantified account for 87·9% (86·5-89·3) of cardiovascular disease DALYs, ranging to a low of 0% for neonatal disorders and neglected tropical diseases and malaria. In terms of global DALYs in 2013, six risks or clusters of risks each caused more than 5% of DALYs: dietary risks accounting for 11·3 million deaths and 241·4 million DALYs, high systolic blood pressure for 10·4 million deaths and 208·1 million DALYs, child and maternal malnutrition for 1·7 million deaths and 176·9 million DALYs, tobacco smoke for 6·1 million deaths and 143·5 million DALYs, air pollution for 5·5 million deaths and 141·5 million DALYs, and high BMI for 4·4 million deaths and 134·0 million DALYs. Risk factor patterns vary across regions and countries and with time. In sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risk factors are child and maternal malnutrition, unsafe sex, and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing. In women, in nearly all countries in the Americas, north Africa, and the Middle East, and in many other high-income countries, high BMI is the leading risk factor, with high systolic blood pressure as the leading risk in most of Central and Eastern Europe and south and east Asia. For men, high systolic blood pressure or tobacco use are the leading risks in nearly all high-income countries, in north Africa and the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. For men and women, unsafe sex is the leading risk in a corridor from Kenya to South Africa. Interpretation: Behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of global mortality and more than one-third of global DALYs providing many opportunities for prevention. Of the larger risks, the attributable burden of high BMI has increased in the past 23 years. In view of the prominence of behavioural risk factors, behavioural and social science research on interventions for these risks should be strengthened. Many prevention and primary care policy options are available now to act on key risks.;;1904;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;1042600;National Institutes of Health

Our aim was to investigate, in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), whether very low HDL-C levels are associated with inflammatory biomarkers. In a cross-sectional study, we included 6,134 patients with ACS; they were classified as having very low (<30 mg/dl), low (30 to 39.9 mg/dl), and normal HDL-C (≥40 mg/dl) levels. We analyzed the association of different categories of HDL-C levels with serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), albumin, and white blood cell count at admission. Overall, 18.5% of patients had very low HDL-C levels. Patients with very low HDL-C levels, compared to patients with low or normal HDL-C levels, had the highest hs-CRP (median 17.8 [interquartile range 7.2 to 54.5] vs 12.6 [5.6 to 33.9] vs 12.0 [5.4 to 36.9] mg/L, respectively, p <0.001) and the lowest albumin levels (median 3.6 [IQR 3.3 to 4.0] vs 3.8 [3.5 to 4.0] vs 3.8 [3.5 to 4.1] g/dl, respectively, p <0.001). White blood cell count did not differ significantly (p = 0.40). The multivariate analysis showed that albumin ≤3.5 g/dl (odds ratio 2.16, 95% confidence interval 1.88 to 2.49, p <0.001) and hs-CRP ≥10 mg/L (odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.55, p <0.001) were independent predictors of very low HDL-C levels. Patients with very low HDL-C levels had the highest inhospital mortality rates compared with the other groups. In conclusion, in patients with ACS, hs-CRP and serum albumin were associated independently with very low HDL-C levels.";;10;0;;;;undefined;

The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development. Methods We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable, country, and time. Findings Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6·2 years (95% UI 5·6-6·6), from 65·3 years (65·0-65·6) in 1990 to 71·5 years (71·0-71·9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5·4 years (4·9-5·8), from 56·9 years (54·5-59·1) to 62·3 years (59·7-64·8), total DALYs fell by 3·6% (0·3-7·4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 000 people fell by 26·7% (24·6-29·1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non-communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, sociodemographic status explained less than 10% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries. Interpretation Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition - in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden - is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions.";;1322;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;2012ZSQN04;National Institutes of Health

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Students between 10 and 12 years of age who were born and raised in the study zone were evaluated. The level of dental fluorosis was determined using the modified Dean index (DI) using criteria recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). A bivariate analysis was performed with the χ2 test, and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between dental fluorosis and the independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 239 students were evaluated. Their mean age was 11±0.82 years, and there were 122 (51%) males. Overall, dental fluorosis was found in 59% of participants; 29.3% had very mild fluorosis, 20.9% had mild fluorosis, 6.7% had moderate fluorosis, and 2.1% had severe fluorosis. The mean fluorosis score was 0.887±0.956. In the final logistic regression model, dental fluorosis was significantly associated with frequency of brushing (OR: 0.444; 95% CI: 0.297–0.666) and with the absence of parental supervision (OR: 0.636; 95% CI: 0.525–0.771). CONCLUSIONS: The association found with frequency of brushing and lack of parental supervision may be contributing to the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis.";Dental | Fluorosis | Mexico | Toothbrushing;16;0;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Recently, DLS imaging has been proposed to help diagnose and follow-up PP where automated recognition of DLS is meaningful. The present study focuses on the automated selection of independent components (ICs) associated with DLS. Extraction of ICs information for clustering by k-means is achieved in two ways: (1) forming features vectors (FVs) containing the kurtosis, entropy and sparsity of each IC or (2) by applying mutual information (MI) or Euclidean distance (ED) to all ICs. Next, silhouette index is computed to estimate the number of necessary clusters (C). Afterward, to detect just the clusters containing ICs of DLS a selection index is proposed. Finally, to estimate the number of DLS per ICs in each selected cluster a time-variant AR modeling is applied; the estimated number is shown in conjunction with the 2D-ICs spatial distribution. The methodology is applied to simulated and real cases; DLS imaging results are also compared against clinical auscultation. The results showed that the automated selection via FVs is promising to imaging DLS.";;2;0;;;;undefined;

In this study, the influence of gender and vasovagal syncope (VVS) on the autonomic response to an orthostatic challenge was investigated by HRV analysis using short-term symbolic dynamics (STSD). This study included 24 healthy young subjects (12 males; 12 age-matched females) and 16 female patients diagnosed with VVS. All subjects were enrolled in a head-up tilt (HUT) test, breathing normally, including 5 minutes of supine position (baseline) and 20-40 minutes of 70° orthostatic phase. The STSD parameters were obtained following their behavior at different times during the HUT test, i.e., at baseline, early and middle orthostatic phases. Gender differences including increased sympathetic activity in men were already present in baseline and in the middle tilt phase. In baseline there were no differences between female controls and female patients, but parameters from STSD showed highly significantly (p=0.0007) reduced heart rate variability due to increased sympathetic activity in female patients in the middle tilt phase. Furthermore a new nonlinear index for the estimation of sympatho-vagal balance was introduced.";;2;0;;;;undefined;

This was conducted in two sets of experiments, with the VMN and POA investigated in the first set, and the MePD and BNST in the second set. The VMN and POA received intense projections from the MePD and BNST. We used a short hairpin RNA encoded within an adeno-associated viral vector directed against the gene for ERα to reduce the number of ERα in the VMN or POA (first set of experiments) or in the BNST or MePD (second set of experiments) in female rats. The rats were housed in groups of four ovariectomised females and three males in a seminatural environment for 8 days. Compared with traditional test set-ups, the seminatural environment provides an arena in which the rats can express their full behavioural repertoire, which allowed us to investigate multiple aspects of social and sexual behaviour in groups of rats. Behavioural observation was performed after oestrogen and progesterone injections. A reduction of ERα expression in the VMN or POA diminished the display of paracopulatory behaviours and lordosis responses compared to controls, whereas the lordosis quotient remained unaffected. This suggests that ERα in the VMN and POA play an important role in intrinsic sexual motivation. The reduction in ERα did not affect the social behaviour of the females, although the males sniffed and pursued the females with reduced ERα less than the controls. This suggests that the ERα in the VMN and POA is involved in the regulation of sexual attractiveness of females. The ERα in the MePD and BNST, on the other hand, plays no role in sociosexual behaviour.;Oestrogen receptor | Rats | Seminatural environment | Sexual behaviour | Social behaviour;22;0;repositoryam;Green;JSPS;15H05724;Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

Design: AAF estimates based on the dose-response RR estimates obtained from previous pair-matched case-crossover fractional polynomial analysis of mean volume in volume categories were calculated from the prevalence of drinking prior to injury in each volume category. Setting: Thirty-seven emergency departments (EDs) across 18 countries. Participants: Probability samples of patients, with equal representation of each shift for each day of the week, totaling 14,026 who arrived at the ED within six hours of injury from ED studies conducted between 2001 and 2011. Measurements: AAF was analyzed by gender, age (18-30; >30), cause of injury (traffic, assault, fall, other), and country detrimental drinking pattern (DDP). Findings: For the EDs analyzed, 16.4% of all injuries were estimated to be attributable to alcohol, and the AAF did not vary by age but was over twice as large for males (20.6%; 19.3-21.8) than for females (8.6%; 7.5-9.7%). While females were at greater risk of injury than males at higher volume levels, lower prevalence of women drinking at higher levels contributed to overall lower AAF for women. Assault-related injuries showed the largest AAF (44.1%; 37.6-42.6). AAF was slightly higher for injuries from falls (14.3%; 12.9-15.7) than motor vehicle crashes (11.1%; 9.3-12.9). AAF was higher in those countries with a DDP of 3 (18.6; 17.5-19.7) and 4 (19.4%; 17.3-21.6) than those with a DDP of 2 (12.0%; 10.5-13.5). Conclusions: Alcohol-attributable injuries presenting in emergency departments are higher for males than females, for violence-related injuries compared with other types of injury, and for countries with more detrimental drinking patterns compared with those with less detrimental patterns.";Alcohol | Alcohol attributable fraction | Dose-response | Emergency department | Gender | Injury | Motor vehicle | Violence;33;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;R01AA013750;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

The purpose of this study was to analyze the association of variables related to crossing the border (cross-border mobility) with three substance use outcomes reported for the last year: 1) heavy drinking (5. + drinks per day for men or 4. + for women), 2) alcohol use disorder (AUD), and 3) co-occurring heavy drinking and drug use (any use of illicit and/or non-medically prescribed drugs). Methods: Household surveys were conducted, using area probability sampling of 1565 Mexican-American residents, aged 18-65, living at the Texas-Mexico border in the metropolitan areas of Laredo and McAllen/Brownsville. Results: Among those 18-29, more frequent crossing of the border was significantly predictive of AUD (OR=1.61, p < 0.01) and co-occurring heavy drinking and drug use (OR=1.70, p < 0.01). Staying more than one full day was predictive of AUD (OR. =. 3.07, p. <. 0.001) and crossing to obtain over-the-counter or prescription drugs (""drug tourism"") or for nightlife/drinking were predictive of heavy drinking (ORs = 4.14, p < 0.001; 3.92, p < 0.01, respectively), AUD (ORs = 7.56, p < 0.001; 7.68, p < 0.01, respectively) and co-occurring heavy drinking and drug use (ORs = 8.53, p < 0.01; 4.96, p < 0.01, respectively).

To face this challenge, the European Union (EU) has set the so-called 2020 Horizon as one of its main objectives: limiting the emission of greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, satisfying 20% of all energy needs through renewable sources, and improving energy efficiency by 20% (The European Union 2012). The last projection forecast in 2012 by the European Environmental Agency (EEA) established that Spain was one of the countries in the EU furthest from reaching these objectives (The European Union 2013). As a result, implementing measures devised to meet the 2020 objectives is currently a priority for the Spanish government. In recent decades, the housing sector has played a decisive role in increasing global energy demands and greenhouse gas emissions (Nejat et al. 2015). In 2014 Spain’s housing sector’s energy consumption needs represented 19% of total national consumption and 31% of the electricity demand (IDAE 2013). Starting from the design phase, reduction in energy consumption per square meter has become a prerequisite for the majority of buildings (Parameshwaran et al. 2012; Koo et al. 2014). The importance and urgency exhibited by the EU housing sector in achieving the government objectives outlined in the 2020 Horizon have led the energy market to show a clear trend towards buildings with higher energy performance in the future (Shimschar et al. 2011). Similarly, the success factor of energy efficiency initiatives will depend to a large degree on the method or the indicators used when measuring energy performance in each building (Abu Bakar et al. 2015; Day and Gunderson 2015). As a result, selecting one energy evaluation methodology over another can be decisive in the path taken by Spain, change the current perception of the country, and increase Spain’s standing within the EU. Several studies (Feist et al. 2005; Schnieders and Hermelink 2006; Mahdavi and Doppelbauer 2010; Mlakar and Strancar 2011; Hatt et al. 2012; Dahlstrøm et al. 2012; Dequaire 2012; Proietti et al. 2013; Ridley et al. 2013; Stoian et al. 2013; Moran et al. 2014; O’Kelly et al. 2014) indicate that the Passivhaus standard (PS) can be used as a highly effective tool in both limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing building energy efficiency. Other studies (Audenaert et al. 2008; Moeseke 2011; Allacker and De Troyer 2013; McLeod et al. 2013; Mlecnik 2013; Stephan et al. 2013) challenge the adoption of the PS because they consider other options within the energy market to be better from both environmental and financial perspectives. Nonetheless, the precursors to the PS claim that the benefits of the standard can be replicated in any part of the world through its use during the design phase (Feist 2014; Passive House Institute 2010, 2015; Passipedia 2015). The main objective of this study was to analyze the viability of using PS through the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) tool in the Spanish housing sector, focusing on its use in the Mediterranean climate in the Province of Barcelona. To that end, we selected an isolated semidetached home, that exhibits the typical characteristics of current Spanish housing so that any possible deficiencies or virtues of adopting the PS are easily observable. The study was conducted using 3 construction proposals (PC, P1, and P2); the initial proposal (PC) is defined by conventional construction technology, while the remaining 2 proposals (P1 and P2) offer different construction alternatives focused on optimization (window glass, the building envelope, and improved installations), enabling evaluation of the PS criteria compliance. To test the ease of obtaining PS compliance without the need for changing the architectural design of the project, the design and space distribution of the PC alternative remained the same for the P1 and P2 options.";Construction costs | Energy efficiency | Mediterranean climate | Passivhaus standard | PHPP;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Sixty lambs were placed in enriched (ED) or conventional (CO) pens (3 pens each treatment, 10 lambs/pen) where ED had a double bunk with ramps and cereal straw as bedding and forage. The CO pen was barren, similar to commercial feedlots, without straw or any other enrichment. The proposed ED had a positive effect on the behavioural characteristics of the lambs, which displayed a richer behavioural repertoire, fewer stereotypes and more affiliative interactions, improving group cohesion. Moreover, ED lambs had enhanced immunity and there were no discernible detrimental effects on performance or on the commercial quality of their meat.

In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. Methods Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620 distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae, concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey data from four countries. Findings Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013. Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2·4 billion and 1·6 billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from 537·6 million in 1990 to 764·8 million in 2013 due to population growth and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from 114·87 per 1000 people to 110·31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013. Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases; however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21·1% in 1990 to 31·2% in 2013. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends and a better understanding of variation across countries.";;4391;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;089963/Z/09/Z;National Institutes of Health

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the cellulase and xylanase production of these isolates and select the most appropriate Bacillus spp. candidates for DFM. Furthermore, an in vitro digestive model, simulating different compartments of the gastrointestinal tract, was used to determine the effect of these selected candidates on digesta viscosity and Clostridium perfringens proliferation in different poultry diets. Production of cellulase and xylanase were based on their relative enzyme activity. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequence classified two strains as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and one of the strains as Bacillus subtilis. The DFM was included at a concentration of 108 spores/g of feed in five different sterile soybean-based diets containing corn, wheat, rye, barley, or oat. After digestion time, supernatants from different diets were collected to measure viscosity, and C. perfringens proliferation. Additionally, from each in vitro simulated compartment, samples were taken to enumerate viable Bacillus spores using a plate count method after heat-treatment. Significant (P < 0.05) DFM-associated reductions in supernatant viscosity and C. perfringens proliferation were observed for all non-corn diets. These results suggest that antinutritional factors, such as non-starch polysaccharides from different cereals, can enhance viscosity and C. perfringens growth. Remarkably, dietary inclusion of the DFM that produce cellulase and xylanase reduced both viscosity and C. perfringens proliferation compared with control diets. Regardless of diet composition, 90% of the DFM spores germinated during the first 30 min in the crop compartment of the digestion model, followed by a noteworthy increased in the intestine compartment by ~2log10, suggesting a full-life cycle development. Further studies to evaluate in vivo necrotic enteritis effects are in progress.;Bacillus-DFM | Clostridium perfringens | Enzymes | Spore | Viscosity;57;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The motor deficit in these patients may be attributable to the degradation of projection fibers associated with the underlying neurodegenerative process. However, this relationship remains unclear. Statistical analysis of diffusion tensor imaging enables an unbiased whole-brain quantitative comparison of the diffusion proprieties of white matter tracts in vivo. Methods: Fourteen genetically confirmed SCA2 patients and aged-matched healthy controls participated in the study. Tract-based spatial statistics were performed to analyze structural white matter damage using two different measurements: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Significant diffusion differences were correlated with the patient's ataxia impairment. Results: Our analysis revealed decreased FA mainly in the inferior/middle/superior cerebellar peduncles, the bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule and the bilateral superior corona radiata. Increases in MD were found mainly in cerebellar white matter, medial lemniscus, and middle cerebellar peduncle, among other regions. Clinical impairment measured with the SARA score correlated with FA in superior parietal white matter and bilateral anterior corona radiata. Correlations with MD were found in cerebellar white matter and the middle cerebellar peduncle. Conclusion: Our findings show significant correlations between diffusion measurements in key areas affected in SCA2 and measures of motor impairment, suggesting a disruption of information flow between motor and sensory-integration areas. These findings result in a more comprehensive view of the clinical impact of the white matter degeneration in SCA2. Copyright:;;20;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

This study explores the influence of parental mental disorders across the lifespan. Data are from the Sao Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey, a crosssectional household study with a representative sample of the adult population living in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area, Brazil (N=2,942). Survival models examined bivariate and multivariate associations between a range of parental disorders and offspring suicidality. After controlling for comorbidity, number of mental disorders and offspring psychopathology, we found that parental psychopathology influences suicidal behaviors throughout most part of the life cycle, from childhood until young adult years. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and antisocial personality were associated with offspring suicidal ideation (OR 1.8 and 1.9, respectively), panic and GAD predicted suicidal attempts (OR 2.3 and 2.7, respectively), and panic was related to the transition from ideation to attempts (OR 2.7). Although noticed in many different stages of the lifespan, this influence is most evident during adolescence. In this period, depression and antisocial personality increased the odds of suicidal ideation (OR 5.1 and 3.2, respectively), and depression, panic disorder, GAD and substance abuse predicted suicidal attempts (OR varying from 1.7 to 3.8). In short, parental disorders characterized by impulsive-aggression and anxiety-agitation were the main predictors of offspring suicidality across the lifespan. This clinically relevant intergenerational transmission of suicide risk was independent of offspring mental disorders, and this underscores the need for a family approach to psychopathology.;;18;1;repositoryam;Green;MOE;undefined;Ministry of Education

The growing field of epigenetics has contributed to our understanding of oncogenesis and tumor progression, and has allowed the development of novel therapeutic drugs. First-generation epigenetic inhibitor drugs have obtained modest clinical results in two types of hematological malignancy. Second-generation epigenetic inhibitors are in development, and have intrinsically greater selectivity for their molecular targets. Solid tumors are more genetic and epigenetically complex than hematological malignancies, but the transcriptome and epigenome biomarkers have been identified for many of these malignancies. This solid tumor molecular aberration profile may be modified using specific or quasi-specific epidrugs together with conventional and innovative anticancer treatments. In this critical review, we briefly analyze the strategies to select the targeted epigenetic changes, enumerate the second-generation epigenetic inhibitors, and describe the main signs indicating the potential of epigenetic therapies in the management of solid tumors. We also highlight the work of consortia or academic organizations that support the undertaking of human epigenetic therapeutic projects as well as some examples of transcriptome/epigenome profile determination in clinical assessment of cancer patients treated with epidrugs. There is a good chance that epigenetic therapies will be able to be used in patients with solid tumors in the future. This may happen soon through collaboration of diverse scientific groups, making the selection of targeted epigenetic aberration(s) more rapid, the design and probe of drug candidates, accelerating in vitro and in vivo assays, and undertaking new cancer epigenetic-therapy clinical trails.;Epigenetic therapy | Solid tumor | Targeted therapy | Treatment;44;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Current estimates of cancer burden in individual countries and regions are necessary to inform local cancer control strategies. OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 28 cancers in 188 countries by sex from 1990 to 2013. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The general methodology of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study was used. Cancer registries were the source for cancer incidence data as well as mortality incidence (MI) ratios. Sources for cause of death data include vital registration system data, verbal autopsy studies, and other sources. The MI ratios were used to transform incidence data to mortality estimates and cause of death estimates to incidence estimates. Cancer prevalence was estimated using MI ratios as surrogates for survival data; YLDs were calculated by multiplying prevalence estimates with disability weights, which were derived from population-based surveys; YLLs were computed by multiplying the number of estimated cancer deaths at each age with a reference life expectancy; and DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. FINDINGS: In 2013 there were 14.9 million incident cancer cases, 8.2 million deaths, and 196.3 million DALYs. Prostate cancer was the leading cause for cancer incidence (1.4 million) for men and breast cancer for women (1.8 million). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer was the leading cause for cancer death in men and women, with 1.6 million deaths. For men, TBL cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (24.9 million). For women, breast cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (13.1 million). Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) per 100 000 and age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) per 100 000 for both sexes in 2013 were higher in developing vs developed countries for stomach cancer (ASIR, 17 vs 14; ASDR, 15 vs 11), liver cancer (ASIR, 15 vs 7; ASDR, 16 vs 7), esophageal cancer (ASIR, 9 vs 4; ASDR, 9 vs 4), cervical cancer (ASIR, 8 vs 5; ASDR, 4 vs 2), lip and oral cavity cancer (ASIR, 7 vs 6; ASDR, 2 vs 2), and nasopharyngeal cancer (ASIR, 1.5 vs 0.4; ASDR, 1.2 vs 0.3). Between 1990 and 2013, ASIRs for all cancers combined (except nonmelanoma skin cancer and Kaposi sarcoma) increased by more than 10% in 113 countries and decreased by more than 10% in 12 of 188 countries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cancer poses a major threat to public health worldwide, and incidence rates have increased in most countries since 1990. The trend is a particular threat to developing nations with health systems that are ill-equipped to deal with complex and expensive cancer treatments. The annual update on the Global Burden of Cancer will provide all stakeholders with timely estimates to guide policy efforts in cancer prevention, screening, treatment, and palliation.";;2148;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;T32HL007093;National Institutes of Health

Methods: The current analyses were restricted to 948 subjects who endorsed drinking at least one drink per week in the past year from a sample of 5037 individuals. Data came from São Paulo Megacity Project (which is part of World Mental Health Surveys) collected between 2005 and 2007. First, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out to test for the best dimensional structure for DSM-5-AUD criteria. Then, item response theory (IRT) was used to investigate the severity and discrimination properties of each criterion of DSM-5-AUD. Finally, differential criterion functioning (DCF) were investigated by socio-demographics (income, gender, age, employment status, marital status and education). All analyses were performed in Mplus software taking into account complex survey design features. Results: The best EFA model was a one-dimensional model. IRT results showed that the criteria ""Time Spent"" and ""Given Up"" have the highest discrimination and severity properties, while the criterion ""Larger/Longer"" had the lowest value of severity, but an average value of discrimination. Only female gender had DCF both at criterion- and factor-level, rendering measurement bias. Conclusion: This study reinforces the existence of a DSM-5-AUD continuum in the largest metropolitan area of South America, including subgroups that had previously higher rates of alcohol use (lower educational/income levels). Lower DSM-5-AUD scores were found in women.";Differential item functioning | DSM-5 | Exploratory factor analysis | Item response theory | Latin America | Megacities;15;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;002/2003;National Institutes of Health

However, its contribution to the amount and distribution of body fat is under investigation. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between genetic variation in ApoE and obesity-related traits in Mexican school children. Material and Methods: Anthropometric, body composition and physical activity measures were conducted using standard methods in 300 children (177 girls/123 boys) who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. DNA was isolated from saliva. ApoE genotypes were analyzed by allelic discrimination. The association between variation in ApoE and anthropometric and body composition measures was investigated using the General Linear Model. Results: The mean ± SD values for age, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were 9.05 ± 0.80 years, 19.01 ± 3.83 and 67.98 ± 10.97 cm, respectively. Approximately 46% of the participants were overweight or obese. A significant association between ApoE isoforms and WC was found after controlling for age, sex and the percentage of physical activity (p = 0.025). Significant main effects were found for vigorous physical activity and light physical activity influencing the adiposity-related BMI (p < 0.001) and WC (p = 0.044), respectively.

The fetuses were obtained at 15, 17 and 19. dpc from both groups, also newborns (NB), neonates (7-15. days) and young adults (6. weeks of age). Histopathological exams were done on the hearts. Immunohistochemistry and western blot demonstrated GATA4 and PCNA protein expression, qPCR real time the mRNA of adrenergic receptors (α-AR and β-AR), alpha and beta myosins (α-MHC, β-MHC) and GATA4. After the administration of ISO, there was no change in the number of offsprings. We observed significant structural changes in the size of the offspring hearts. Morphometric analysis revealed an increase in the size of the left ventricular wall and interventricular septum (IVS). Histopathological analysis demonstrated loss of cellular compaction and presence of left ventricular small fibrous foci after birth. Adrenergic receptors might be responsible for changing a physiological into a pathological hypertrophy. However GATA4 seemed to be the determining factor in the pathology.

We analyzed 176 SNPs for 115 loci previously associated to T2D, GDM and body mass index (BMI), as well as a set of 118 Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs), in 750 pregnant Mexican women.

Remarkably, a major susceptibility SLC16A11 locus for T2D in Mexicans was not shown to play a role in GDM risk. The fact that two of the main T2D associated loci also contribute to the risk of developing GDM in Mexicans, confirm that both diseases share a common genetic background. However, lack of association with a Native American contribution T2D risk haplotype, SLC16A11, suggests that other genetic mechanisms may be in play for GDM.";;49;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

In a production system of soilless culture, the effect of five treatments of H2PO4- (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0meq·l-1) was assessed on the variables: total dry biomass, fruit production, P concentration in leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruits, and extraction of P (g/plant). The plants were placed in 15 liter containers and volcanic rock was used as substrate. The plants were grown for 90 days after transplantation. Differences in total dry biomass, fruit production, P concentration in roots and fruits, and P extraction by plants were found. The increased production of fruit and total dry biomass were obtained with 1.5meq·l-1 H2PO4-, with 851.71 and 182.26 g/plant, respectively. The treatment with 2.0meq·l-1 H2PO4- had the highest P concentration in roots with 1.43% and reduced significantly the fruit production.

Whether the co-occurrence of alcohol and drug use and disorders is also high in the border area is unknown. Methods: Data are from the U.S.-Mexico Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected respondents interviewed from 2011 to 2013. Participants included 1,690 Mexican Americans from Texas (572 in an off-border city and 1,118 from 3 border cities) and 1,293 Mexicans from Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas (415 in an off-border city and 878 from 3 Mexican cities bordering Texas) who reported drinking in the last 12 months. Participants were interviewed regarding the prevalence of and risk factors for: (i) co-occurring hazardous alcohol use (5+/4+ at least monthly) and drug use (medical and illicit) and (ii) co-occurring presence of a DSM-5 alcohol use disorder (AUD) and 2 symptoms (hazardous use and quit/control) of drug use disorder (DUD symptoms). Results: Co-occurring hazardous alcohol and drug use was more common in the U.S. border cities (14.7%) than off-border (7.2%), but similar for Mexican border (1.2%) and off-border (1.4%) cities. Co-occurrence of AUD and DUD symptoms was likewise more common at the U.S. border (6.8%) than off-border (3.3%), as well as at the Mexican border (1.3%), compared to off-border (0.6%), but not statistically significant for Mexico. In models adjusting for demographics, mobility factors and exposure to the U.S. culture, border residence in both countries related to a nearly twofold increase in prevalence ratios (PRs) of co-occurring AUD and DUD symptoms (PR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.36 to 2.85). Conclusions: Increased rates of co-occurring AUDs and DUDs suggest an added negative impact on already difficult conditions of the border population.;Alcohol use | Co-Occurrence | Drug use | DSM-5 | U.S.-Mexico border;19;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;R01AA018365;National Institutes of Health

The patients were from four different Colombian cities. After confirmatory factor analyzes (CFA), internal consistency tests were performed using Cronbach's Alpha coefficient and intra-rater and inter-rater reliability using Cohen's Kappa coefficients and Spearman's Rank correlation coefficients. Results: The CFA confirmed the bi-dimensionality of the construct. Good internal consistency with Cronbach's Alpha of 0.89 and 0.81 for the domains of Activities and Participation and Environmental Factors was observed, respectively. Two items were eliminated from the original instrument. The first domain showed good intra-rater reliability (Kappa 0.683) and inter-rater (Kappa 0.688). The second domain showed satisfactory reliability with Kappa 0.423 for intra-rater and 0.507 for inter-rater. The Spearman correlation coefficients ranged between 0.687 and 0.917 (p < 0.001).

In the present study, the relationship of proximity of living at the border and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) is analyzed from the U.S.-Mexico Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions (UMSARC). Methods: Household surveys were conducted on 2336 Mexican Americans in Texas (771 in a non-border city and 1565 from three border cities located in the three poorest counties in the U.S.) and 2460 Mexicans from the states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas in Mexico (811 in a non-border city and 1649 from three cities which are sister cities to the Texas border sites). Results: Among current drinkers, prevalence of AUD was marginally greater (p < 0.10) at the U.S. border compared to the non-border, but the opposite was true in Mexico (p < 0.001), and these trends continued on both sides across volume and 5+ drinking days. Prevalence was greater in Laredo/Nuevo Laredo relative to their respective sister city counterparts on the same side. Border effects appeared greater for males than females in the U.S. and the opposite in Mexico. Conclusion: The data suggest that border proximity may affect AUD in both the U.S. and Mexico, but in the opposite direction, and may be related to the relative perceived or actual stress of living in the respective communities.";Alcohol use disorders | Drinking patterns | U.S./Mexico border;22;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;R01 AA01836540;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

Objective: This study aimed to estimate if dementia and other mental disorders are associated with suicide ideation among the older people controlling for demographic and other suspected risk factors. Methods: We report on the Mexican study of dementia, part of the 10/66 international dementia research group, a series of cross-sectional population-based surveys in low and middle income countries. A survey was conducted to all residents aged 65 years and older from urban and rural catchment areas in Mexico City and Morelos (January 2006 to June 2007). Results: After 18months of field work, a total of 2003 completed interviews were obtained, with a response rate of 85.1%. We found a lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation of 13.5% and a 2-week prevalence of 4.2%. The common factors associated with both lifetime and 2-week prevalence were having a large number of physical disorders (lifetime prevalence ratio = PR and 95% confidence interval = CI; PR = 2.23, CI = 1.63-3.06), depression (PR = 1.92, CI = 1.36-2.70) and anxiety (PR = 2.23, CI = 1.68-2.97) and screening positive for psychosis (PR = 1.64, CI = 1.15-2.34). Conclusion: Dementia plays a minor role on suicide ideation after the other aforementioned variables were taken into account and its effect, if any, could be concentrated among those elders with lower severity scores of dementia. These results show the great challenges that Mexico faces in providing services for the older people with suicidality. As the population in the country ages, suicidality will constitute an additional challenge to the healthcare system.";Dementia | Developing countries | Mental health | Older adults | Suicidal ideation;11;0;;;;undefined;

All the variables studied displayed distinct instantaneous response patterns to each maneuver: while in CFT they increased to a plateau, in AOT they presented overshoots at the beginning and end of the test. In both tests, LFdmAP and LFSP dynamics were similar and strongly correlated, and presented a weak correlation with LFRR. Means of LFdmAP and LFSP in CFT were 7 times smaller than in AOT. Our findings support that LFSP and LFdmAP powers exhibit similar performance as noninvasive sympathetic markers and that all variables studied show distinctive beat-to-beat response patterns to each maneuver.

Design: Pair-matched case-cross-over analysis of drinking prior to injury, using categorical step-function and fractional polynomial analysis. Setting: Thirty-seven emergency departments (EDs) across 18 countries. Participants: A total of 13119 injured drinkers arriving at the ED within 6 hours of the event. Measurements: The dose-response relationship was analyzed by gender, age, cause of injury (traffic, violence, fall, other) and country detrimental drinking pattern (DDP). Findings: Estimated risks were similar between the two analytical methods, with injury risk doubling at one drink [odds ratio (OR)=2.3-2.7] and peaking at about 30 drinks. Although risk was similar for males and females up to three drinks (OR=4.6), it appeared to increase more rapidly for females and was significantly higher starting from 20 drinks [female OR=28.6; confidence interval (CI)=16.8, 48.9; male OR=12.8; CI=10.1, 16.3]. No significant differences were found across age groups. Risk was significantly higher for violence-related injury than for other causes across the volume range. Risk was also higher at all volumes for DDP-3 compared with DDP-2 countries. Conclusions: There is an increasing risk relationship between alcohol and injury but risk is not uniform across gender, cause of injury or country drinking pattern. The fractional polynomial approach is a valid and efficient approach for modeling the alcohol injury risk relationship.";Detrimental drinking pattern | Dose-response | Emergency department | Gender | Injury cause | Injury risk;55;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;P50AA005595;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

Aims: To examine the association of past-year mental health treatment with DSM-IV disorders. Method: The World Health Organization's World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys interviewed community samples of adults in 23 countries (n = 62 305) about DSM-IV disorders and treatment in the past 12 months for problems with emotions, alcohol or drugs. Results: Roughly half (52%) of people who received treatment met criteria for a past-year DSM-IV disorder, an additional 18% for a lifetime disorder and an additional 13% for other indicators of need (multiple subthreshold disorders, recent stressors or suicidal behaviours). Dose-response associations were found between number of indicators of need and treatment. Conclusions: The vast majority of treatment in the WMH countries goes to patients with mental disorders or other problems expected to benefit from treatment.;;25;1;repositoryvor;Green;NIMH;FIRCA R03-TW006481;National Institute of Mental Health

In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188 countries between 1990, and 2013. We used the results to assess whether there is epidemiological convergence across countries. Methods We estimated age-sex-specific all-cause mortality using the GBD 2010 methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an updated database of vital registration, survey, and census data. We generally estimated cause of death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements included the addition of more recent vital registration data for 72 countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature review, two new and detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, UK, Turkey, and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the 240 causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant strategy for causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were informed by meta-regression of prevalence studies. For pathogen-specific causes of diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections we used a counterfactual approach. We computed two measures of convergence (inequality) across countries: the average relative difference across all pairs of countries (Gini coefficient) and the average absolute difference across countries. To summarise broad findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age 15 years to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age 75 years, and life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all quantities reported, we computed 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We constrained cause-specific fractions within each age-sex-country-year group to sum to all-cause mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. Findings Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65·3 years (UI 65·0-65·6) in 1990, to 71·5 years (UI 71·0-71·9) in 2013, while the number of deaths increased from 47·5 million (UI 46·8-48·2) to 54·9 million (UI 53·6-56·3) over the same interval. Global progress masked variation by age and sex: for children, average absolute differences between countries decreased but relative differences increased. For women aged 25-39 years and older than 75 years and for men aged 20-49 years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative differences increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal causes in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa. For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell whereas for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts have increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates. Global deaths from injury increased by 10·7%, from 4·3 million deaths in 1990 to 4·8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%. For some causes of more than 100 000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes, and malaria are still in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three phases of life were substantially varied between and within regions. Interpretation For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in age-sex specific mortality has been associated with a progressive shift towards a larger share of the remaining deaths caused by non-communicable disease and injuries. Assessing epidemiological convergence across countries depends on whether an absolute or relative measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, age-standardised death rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, suggesting the potential for reversals in some countries.

AP has been suggested to be a hypersensitivity reaction to the presence of eosinophils and the local production of IgE. Material and Methods: Descriptive study, using paraffin blocks of tissue that have been diagnosed with AP from the Dermopathology department, Hospital General Dr. Manuel Gea González. In 66 blocks from 63 patients, eosinophils were identified by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and mastocytes were labeled by immunohistochemistry. Three random microphotographs (40x) were used, and cell counts were calculated as the mean count in the 3 microphotographs. Results: Forty cases (63.5%) were female, and 23 (36.5%) were male. The mean age was 26.49 ±14.09 years; regarding the evolution time of the disease, the average was 11.93 years ±11.39. In 38 of 63 cases (60%), the lip, skin, and conjunctiva were affected clinically. In 22 of 63 cases (34%), AP cheilitis was the sole manifestation, and in 4 of 63 cases (6%), there were lesions in the skin and conjunctiva. The mean eosinophil count was 9 per case, the average number of mastocytes/field was 28.48 (range 0 to 66) Kruskal-Wallis p=0.001.

Oxidative cell damage plays an important role in HCV physiopathology. Oxidative stress is triggered when the concentration of oxygen species in the extracellular or intracellular environment exceeds antioxidant defenses. Cells are protected and modulate oxidative stress through the interplay of intracellular antioxidant agents, mainly glutathione system (GSH) and thioredoxin; and antioxidant enzyme systems such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, GSH peroxidase, and heme oxygenase-1. Also, the use of natural and synthetic antioxidants (vitamin C and E, N-acetylcysteine, glycyrrhizin, polyenylphosphatidyl choline, mitoquinone, quercetin, S-adenosylmethionine and silymarin) has already shown promising results as co-adjuvants in HCV therapy. Despite all the available information, it is not known how different agents with antiviral activity can interfere with the modulation of the cell redox state induced by HCV and decrease viral replication. This review describes an evidence-based consensus on molecular mechanisms involved in HCV replication and their relationship with cell damage induced by oxidative stress generated by the virus itself and cell antiviral machinery.

This makes us think that in the development of various research questions it is necessary to use different methodological tools, either to obtain information or analyze it.

At the same time, these changes in energy balance may cause an insufficient protein synthesis by ruminal bacteria, compromising the flow of amino acids to the udder and decreasing the milk protein content. Since herd milk components are routinely analysed, the aim of this study was to use the data of the fat:protein ratio of milk routinely gathered at farms to estimate the serum concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate, and as predictor of subclinical ketosis in dairy herds at early lactation. Data from 59 samples, one per herd (average of 5 individual samples each) of tank milk and blood of multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows (between 19 to 106 d of lactation) were analysed. A positive correlation of β-hydroxybutyrate levels with the fat:protein ratio (R2 = 0.42; P < 0.001) was found. To discriminate between healthy herds and herds affected by subclinical ketosis, ten cutoff points from 0.9 to 1 mM were employed. From the cutoff point of 0.96 mM and up to the critical cutpoint of 1 mM of β-hydroxybutyrate, the model reached 42.9% sensitivity, 98.1% specificity, a value of odds ratio (OR) of 6.19 (P < 0.001), low values of false positive (25%) and false negative (7.3%), when related to fat:protein ratio levels.

In all mammal species mothers constitute the most important social contact for their young during the first months of life, as they facilitate the acquisition of information on the physical and social environments. In sheep, soon after parturition, a mutual, lasting ewe-lamb bond is established. Mothers can identify their young through the use of different sensory modalities (olfaction, vision, hearing and direct contact), but the proper expression of adequate maternal behaviour is made more difficult by modern livestock-handling systems that in order to increase fecundity intensify demands on the mothering ability of ewes. In conventional dairy sheep production systems, weaning lambs are suckled by either their dams or surrogates. When the ewe-lamb bond is broken, frustration arising from maternal feeding deprivation and the absence of maternal care alter endocrine and behavioural responses and reduce growth, suggesting emotional disturbances in the lambs. Many authors have indicated that stressor factors on the farm, such as isolation or separation, alter the indexes of animal welfare, including hormonal, haematological and biochemical parameters. In the case of sheep, the fact that they are gregarious animals makes them highly sensitive to the stress of separation from the flock. The measurement of plasma constituents in blood samples can provide information about the stress that animals suffer during various handling operations. On the other hand, weaning, particularly at a young age, is also associated with perturbed growth rates and an increased susceptibility to disease. Disruption of the maternal relationship, therefore, is at least a transient source of poor welfare for lambs, and may disturb the acquisition of social and survival-related behaviours. The lambs manifested strong vocal responses when these periods of temporary separation were first imposed, but eventually became habituated to the procedure and then showed little response compared to lambs that had not experienced such temporary separations. The close mother-offspring relationship established during the first few minutes of life after birth is very important for the development and survival of newborns in practically all species, including sheep. To improve our understanding of the consequences of breaking the ewe-lamb bond, factors that contribute to the establishment of the motheryoung relationship are discussed in the first part of this review. The second part deals specifically with the effects of separation on the ewe-lamb bond; namely, variables and measurements of behaviour, vocalisations, and blood profiles.";Behaviour | Ewe-lamb bond | Sensorial signals | Separation | Vocalisation | Welfare;5;0;;;;undefined;

The English version of Eating Appraisal Due to Emotions and Stress Questionnaire (EADES) was developed to assess how individuals use food in order to cope with stress and emotions. Objective: to analyze psychometric characteristics of Spanish version of EADES and to identify whether the constructs of EADES were associated with obesity in university students. Methods: the EADES (Spanish version) was administered to 232 Mexican university students from 18 to 29 years old. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated. A test-retest evaluation was conducted with 75 participants. Results: Cronbach’s alpha of EADES was 0.92; the interclass correlation coefficient was 0.88. Regarding BMI and EADES results, the subscale Emotion and Stress Related Eating was significantly associated with obesity (p = 0.026). Through factor analysis of the instrument, three factors were extracted and items that showed factor loading < 0.40 were eliminated. 40 items remained in the questionnaire. With regard to obesity and the 40-items version of the instrument, a statistically significance association was found for the total score (OR = 0.973, p = 0.020) and for the factor Self-confidence related to Emotional Eating component (OR = 0.940, p = 0.026).

Three classes of genes regulating 5-HT function are constitutively expressed or induced in these cells: (a) membrane proteins that regulate the response to 5-HT, such as SERT, 5HTR-GPCR, and the 5HTion channels; (b) downstream signaling transduction proteins; and (c) enzymes controlling 5-HT metabolism, such as IDO and MAO, which can generate biologically active catabolites, including melatonin, kynurenines, and kynurenamines. This review covers the clinical and experimental mechanisms involved in 5-HT-induced immunomodulation. These mechanisms are cell-specific and depend on the expression of serotonergic components in immune cells. Consequently, 5-HT can modulate several immunological events, such as chemotaxis, leukocyte activation, proliferation, cytokine secretion, anergy, and apoptosis. The effects of 5-HT on immune cells may be relevant in the clinical outcome of pathologies with an inflammatory component. Major depression, fibromyalgia, Alzheimer disease, psoriasis, arthritis, allergies, and asthma are all associated with changes in the serotonergic system associated with leukocytes. Thus, pharmacological regulation of the serotonergic system may modulate immune function and provide therapeutic alternatives for these diseases.";;132;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The weight of ewes after transportation was lower for T1 in comparison with T2. Blood hematocrit values of ewes before and after transportation and after fast in the waiting pen were not different among the treatments, with mean value of 58.50%.

Methods The study employed a case-crossover design with the frequency approach. Clients (N = 616) in substance abuse treatment for alcohol or cocaine issues from 2009 to 2012 completed a self-administered questionnaire on their substance use within 3 and 6 h before a recent injury or physically aggressive incident. Clients also reported detailed quantity and frequency information in relation to their typical substance use, as well as information on ""feeling effects"". The RR of acute harms due to substance use was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel estimator. Results In the 6-h window before the event, use of cocaine alone, alcohol alone and simultaneous alcohol and cocaine use were each significantly (P < 0.05) related to a recent injury and aggressive incident. Simultaneous use was not significantly greater than use of either drug alone. Estimates of RR based on simultaneous use for a 3-h window before the event were consistently larger than those based on a 6-h window, and comparisons were significant (P < 0.05) for an aggressive incident but not an injury. With reference to the two measures of exposure, three of eight comparisons of RRs were significantly larger for feeling the effects of the substance in comparison to quantity and frequency of substance use. Conclusion These findings are consistent with increased likelihood of harms related to the acute effects of alcohol alone, cocaine alone or simultaneous use. The results are suggestive that the acute effects of these drugs may be better measured within a 3-h time window than a 6-h window. Finally, we found that ""hours of feeling effects"" yielded higher estimates of RR than the quantity-frequency approach; however both measures support the overall findings.";Aggression | Alcohol | Case-crossover | Cocaine | Injury;7;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;89906;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

Methods: Clients from five substance abuse treatment agencies presenting with a primary problem of cocaine or alcohol were classified into three groups as dependent on: (1) alcohol alone, (2) cocaine alone, or (3) both cocaine and alcohol (i.e. concurrent dependence). Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire that included details of their drug and alcohol use, physical health, mental health, social health, economic health, and demographic characteristics. Results: The concurrent group drank similar amounts of alcohol as those in the alcohol group and used similar amounts of cocaine as the cocaine group. The alcohol group had significantly (p < .05) poorer health profiles than the concurrent group across most variables of the four health domains. An exception was significantly more accidental injuries (p < .05) in the alcohol group. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, the concurrent group had significantly (p < .05) more accidental injuries, violence, and overdoses than the cocaine group. As well, the concurrent group had significantly (p < .05) higher scores on the anxiety and sexual compulsion scales than the cocaine group, controlling for demographic variables. Conclusion: These findings can aid health care professionals to better respond to issues related to concurrent dependence of cocaine and alcohol.;Alcohol | Cocaine | Concurrent | Health profiles | Substance abuse;10;0;;;CIHR;89906;Canadian Institutes of Health Research

This research has used traditional objective social status (OSS) measures, such as educational level, income, and occupation. Recently, subjective social status (SSS) measurement has been advocated to capture the perception of relative social status, but to our knowledge, there have been no studies of associations between SSS and mental disorders. OBJECTIVES To estimate associations of SSS with DSM-IV mental disorders in multiple countries and to investigate whether the associations persist after comprehensive adjustment of OSS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Face-to-face cross-sectional household surveys of community-dwelling adults in 18 countries in Asia, South Pacific, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East (N = 56 085). Subjective social status was assessed with a self-anchoring scale reflecting respondent evaluations of their place in the social hierarchies of their countries in terms of income, educational level, and occupation. Scores on the 1 to 10 SSS scale were categorized into 4 categories: low (scores 1-3), low-mid (scores 4-5), high-mid (scores 6-7), and high (scores 8-10). Objective social status was assessed with a wide range of fine-grained objective indicators of income, educational level, and occupation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed the 12-month prevalence of 16 DSM-IV mood, anxiety, and impulse control disorders. RESULTS The weighted mean survey response rate was 75.2%(range, 55.1%-97.2%). Graded inverse associations were found between SSS and all 16 mental disorders. Gross odds ratios (lowest vs highest SSS categories) in the range of 1.8 to 9.0 were attenuated but remained significant for all 16 disorders (odds ratio, 1.4-4.9) after adjusting for OSS indicators. This pattern of inverse association between SSS and mental disorders was significant in 14 of 18 individual countries, and in low-, middle-, and high-income country groups but was significantly stronger in high- vs lower-income countries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Significant inverse associations between SSS and numerous DSM-IV mental disorders exist across a wide range of countries even after comprehensive adjustment for OSS. Although it is unclear whether these associations are the result of social selection, social causation, or both, these results document clearly that research relying exclusively on standard OSS measures underestimates the steepness of the social gradient in mental disorders.;;82;1;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH059575;National Institute of Mental Health

We examined associations between a wide range of DSM-IV mental disorders with adult onset of asthma and whether observed associations remain after mental comorbidity adjustments. Methods: During face-to-face household surveys in community-dwelling adults (n=52,095) of 19 countries, the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview retrospectively assessed lifetime prevalence and age at onset of 16 DSM-IV mental disorders. Asthma was assessed by self-report of physician's diagnosis together with age of onset. Survival analyses estimated associations between first onset of mental disorders and subsequent adult onset asthma, without and with comorbidity adjustment. Results: 1860 adult onset (21 years+) asthma cases were identified, representing a total of 2,096,486 person-years of follow up. After adjustment for comorbid mental disorders several mental disorders were associated with subsequent adult asthma onset: bipolar (OR=1.8; 95%CI 1.3-2.5), panic (OR=1.4; 95%CI 1.0-2.0), generalized anxiety (OR=1.3; 95%CI 1.1-1.7), specific phobia (OR=1.3; 95%CI 1.1-1.6); post-traumatic stress (OR=1.5; 95%CI 1.1-1.9); binge eating (OR=1.8; 95%CI 1.2-2.9) and alcohol abuse (OR=1.5; 95%CI 1.1-2.0). Mental comorbidity linearly increased the association with adult asthma. The association with subsequent asthma was stronger for mental disorders with an early onset (before age 21). Conclusions: A wide range of temporally prior mental disorders are significantly associated with subsequent onset of asthma in adulthood. The extent to which asthma can be avoided or improved among those with early mental disorders deserves study.";Asthma | Chronic disease | Comorbidity | Epidemiology | Mental disorders | Population;46;0;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

In this study, the influence of gender on the autonomic response to an orthostatic challenge was investigated by obtaining the cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory coupling using the nonlinear technique known as joint symbolic dynamics (JSD) representation. This study includes 24 healthy young subjects. Males (N=12) and age-matched females (N=12) were enrolled in a head-up tilt (HUT) test, breathing normally, including 5 minutes of supine position (baseline) and 25-40 minutes of 70° orthostatic phase. The cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory couplings were obtained at baseline, early and middle orthostatic phases. Although in baseline there were some gender differences, parameters from JSD showed highly significant (p=0.0004) differences in specific cardiovascular coupling patterns in the early tilt phase. Furthermore, JSD analysis revealed that in males, due to increased sympathetic activity, exist a lower degree of cardiovascular coupling accompanied with an increased occurrence of tachycardic patterns. On the other hand, the cardiorespiratory coupling revealed only very few slightly significant differences in all three phases.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

We have developed a novel concept for immunogen construction based on introduction of massive mutations within the epitopes targeting antigenically variable pathogens and diseases. Previously, we showed that these immunogens carrying large combinatorial libraries of mutated epitope variants, termed as variable epitope libraries (VELs), induce potent, broad and long lasting CD8+IFN-γ+ T-cell response as well as HIV-neutralizing antibodies. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested immunogenic properties and anti-tumor effects of the VELs bearing survivin-derived CTL epitope (GWEPDDNPI) variants in an aggressive metastatic mouse 4T1 breast tumor model. The constructed VELs had complexities of 10,500 and 8,000 individual members, generated as combinatorial M13 phage display and synthetic peptide libraries, respectively, with structural composition GWXPXDXPI, where X is any of 20 natural amino acids. Statistically significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in BALB/c mice immunized with the VELs in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Vaccinated mice developed epitope-specific spleen cell and CD8+ IFN-γ+ T-cell responses that recognize more than 50% of the panel of 87 mutated epitope variants, as demonstrated in T-cell proliferation assays and FACS analysis. These data indicate the feasibility of the application of this new class of immunogens based on VEL concept as an alternative approach for the development of molecular vaccines against cancer.;Antigenic variability | Cancer epitope vaccine | Peptide vaccine | Variable epitope library;12;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

It is distributed worldwide. Factors associated with virulence (such as hemolysins, enterotoxins, proteases, phospholipases, aerobactin, and hemagglutinin) have been identified; however, its pathogenicity mechanism is still unknown. In pathogenic Vibrio species such as V.cholerae, Vibrio. parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus, capsule, biofilms, lateral flagellum, and type IV pili are structures described as essential for pathogenicity. These structures had not been described in V.mimicus until this work. We used 20 V.mimicus strains isolated from water (6), oyster (9), and fish (5) samples and we were able to identify the capsule, biofilm, lateral flagellum, and type IV pili through phenotypic tests, electron microscopy, PCR, and sequencing. In all tested strains, we observed and identified the presence of capsular exopolysaccharide, biofilm formation in an invitro model, as well as swarming, multiple flagellation, and pili. In addition, we identified homologous genes to those described in other bacteria of the genus in which these structures have been found. Identification of these structures in V.mimicus is a contribution to the biology of this organism and can help to reveal its pathogenic behavior.";Biofilm | Capsule | Lateral flagellum | Pili | Vibrio mimicus;18;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Thus, the MPCA is a potential animal model for PE. Aim: In this study, we further analyze whether the features of the MPCA satisfy the validity criteria for it to be considered an animal model as well as the possible participation of the serotoninergic system in the faster ejaculation exhibited by male rats in the MPCA. Methods: In Experiment 1, male rats were tested in a standard arena to assess their sexual behavior, then were assessed 1 week later in the MPCA. Another group was first tested in the MPCA, then in a standard arena. In Experiment 2, male rats divided into two groups were treated daily with WAY-100635 (5-HT1A antagonist) or vehicle for 15 days. In each group, half of the subjects were tested in a standard arena and half were tested in the MPCA on days 1, 8, and 15 of treatment. Main Outcome Measures: Number of intromissions and intromission and ejaculation latencies were the main outcome measures. Results: In Experiment 1, males tested in the MPCA ejaculated significantly faster, regardless of the order in which they were evaluated in both arenas. In Experiment 2, the administration of WAY-100635 increased intromission and ejaculation latencies, and the number of intromissions in the MPCA. Conclusions: The results obtained in the MPCA support its use as an animal model for PE evaluation.;Animal Models | Premature Ejaculation | Serotonin Receptors | Sexual Behavior | Validation Criteria;4;0;;;;undefined;

ratio (MMR; number of maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths) between 1990 and 2015. We aimed to measure levels and track trends in maternal mortality, the key causes contributing to maternal death, and timing of maternal death with respect to delivery. Methods We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to analyse a database of data for 7065 site-years and estimate the number of maternal deaths from all causes in 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. We estimated the number of pregnancy-related deaths caused by HIV on the basis of a systematic review of the relative risk of dying during pregnancy for HIV-positive women compared with HIV-negative women. We also estimated the fraction of these deaths aggravated by pregnancy on the basis of a systematic review. To estimate the numbers of maternal deaths due to nine diff erent causes, we identified 61 sources from a systematic review and 943 site-years of vital registration data. We also did a systematic review of reports about the timing of maternal death, identifying 142 sources to use in our analysis. We developed estimates for each country for 1990-2013 using Bayesian meta-regression. We estimated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all values. Findings 292 982 (95% UI 261 017-327 792) maternal deaths occurred in 2013, compared with 376 034 (343 483-407 574) in 1990. The global annual rate of change in the MMR was -0.3% (-1.1 to 0.6) from 1990 to 2003, and -2.7% (-3.9 to -1.5) from 2003 to 2013, with evidence of continued acceleration. MMRs reduced consistently in south, east, and southeast Asia between 1990 and 2013, but maternal deaths increased in much of sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s. 2070 (1290-2866) maternal deaths were related to HIV in 2013, 0.4% (0.2-0.6) of the global total. MMR was highest in the oldest age groups in both 1990 and 2013. In 2013, most deaths occurred intrapartum or postpartum. Causes varied by region and between 1990 and 2013. We recorded substantial variation in the MMR by country in 2013, from 956.8 (685.1-1262.8) in South Sudan to 2.4 (1.6-3.6) in Iceland. Interpretation Global rates of change suggest that only 16 countries will achieve the MDG 5 target by 2015. Accelerated reductions since the Millennium Declaration in 2000 coincide with increased development assistance for maternal, newborn, and child health. Setting of targets and associated interventions for after 2015 will need careful consideration of regions that are making slow progress, such as west and central Africa.

The aims of this paper are to (i) present the main controversies surrounding the decision to include internet gaming disorder, but not internet addiction more globally, as a non-substance addiction in the research appendix of the DSM-5, and (ii) discuss the meaning behind the DSM-5 criteria for internet gaming disorder. The paper also proposes a common method for assessing internet gaming disorder. Although the need for common diagnostic criteria is not debated, the existence of multiple instruments reflect the divergence of opinions in the field regarding how best to diagnose this condition. Methods: We convened international experts from European, North and South American, Asian and Australasian countries to discuss and achieve consensus about assessing internet gaming disorder as defined within DSM-5. Results: We describe the intended meaning behind each of the nine DSM-5 criteria for internet gaming disorder and present a single item that best reflects each criterion, translated into the 10 main languages of countries in which research on this condition has been conducted. Conclusions: Using results from this cross-cultural collaboration, we outline important research directions for understanding and assessing internet gaming disorder. As this field moves forward, it is critical that researchers and clinicians around the world begin to apply a common methodology; this report is the first to achieve an international consensus related to the assessment of internet gaming disorder.";Addiction | Behavioral addiction | Diagnosis | DSM-5 | Gaming | Internet gaming;561;0;;;NIAAA;P60AA003510;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between rare protein-coding genetic variants and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a large Latino population and to explore potential molecular and physiological mechanisms for the observed relationships. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on DNA samples from 3756 Mexican and US Latino individuals (1794 with type 2 diabetes and 1962 without diabetes) recruited from 1993 to 2013. One variant was further tested for allele frequency and association with type 2 diabetes in large multiethnic data sets of 14 276 participants and characterized in experimental assays. MAINOUTCOME AND MEASURES: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Secondary outcomes included age of onset, body mass index, and effect on protein function. RESULTS: A single rare missense variant (c.1522G>A [p.E508K]) was associated with type 2 diabetes prevalence (odds ratio [OR], 5.48; 95% CI, 2.83-10.61; P = 4.4 × 10-7) in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-α (HNF1A), the gene responsible for maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3). This variant was observed in 0.36% of participants without type 2 diabetes and 2.1% of participants with it. In multiethnic replication data sets, the p.E508K variant was seen only in Latino patients (n = 1443 with type 2 diabetes and 1673 without it) and was associated with type 2 diabetes (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.75-9.92; P = .0013). In experimental assays, HNF-1A protein encoding the p.E508K mutant demonstrated reduced transactivation activity of its target promoter compared with a wild-type protein. In our data, carriers and noncarriers of the p.E508K mutation with type 2 diabetes had no significant differences in compared clinical characteristics, including age at onset. The mean (SD) age for carriers was 45.3 years (11.2) vs 47.5 years (11.5) for noncarriers (P = .49) and the mean (SD) BMI for carriers was 28.2 (5.5) vs 29.3 (5.3) for noncarriers (P = .19). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a single low-frequency variant in the MODY3-causing gene HNF1A that is associated with type 2 diabetes in Latino populations and may affect protein function. This finding may have implications for screening and therapeutic modification in this population, but additional studies are required.";;154;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Methods We analyzed data from 8 countries that participated in the World Mental Health Survey Initiative (n=47,552). We identified 6.8% and 18.9% of the sample who we think were screened out inappropriately (SCI) from the euphoric and irritable bipolar sections respectively. We compared them to those who were allowed to continue the section (CONT, 2.6% of the sample for euphoric; 1.0% for irritable) and to the reference group (REF, 69.5% of the sample). Results The SCI group had consistently higher rates of major depression (29.1% vs. 6.4%), earlier age of onset (24.3 y vs. 32.4 y), more suicide attempts (13.3% vs. 5.9%), and more episodes (4.2 vs. 2.7) than the REF for the euphoric group. Similar findings exist for the irritable group. Also, comorbidity with anxiety, disruptive behavior disorders and substance use were much higher than the REF. Limitations As with all epidemiologic studies, recall bias cannot be ruled out. Conclusions The findings above suggest that a number of the SCI subjects belong to the bipolar group. A revision of instruments used in epidemiologic research will probably prove what clinical studies have been showing that bipolar disorder is more common than has been reported. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.";Bipolar disorder | Composite International Diagnostic Interview | Diagnosis;17;0;;;NIH;4280;National Institutes of Health

Yeasts have been the preferred source for SCP production over bacteria, particularly for human consumption, as they are related to products, such as bread or beer; however, bacteria have higher protein content, higher yields, and faster growth rate, but they are less accepted for human food. The main drawback for the SCP consumption is its high content of nucleic acids and components of cell wall, which limits its uptake in the diet, at least so that the biomass can be processed to isolate the protein.";Bacteria | Candida | Fermentation | Hydrocarbons | Kluyveromyces | Methylococcus | Methylomonas | Methylophilus | Microbial biomass | Microbial protein | Molasses | Saccharomyces | Single-cell protein | Whey | Yeasts;13;0;;;;undefined;

Methods: Data are from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey collected in 2005-2007, as part of the World Mental Health Survey Initiative. A latent class analysis of the 11 DSM-5-AUD criteria was performed using Mplus, taking into account complex survey design features. Weighted logistic regression models were used to examine demographic correlates of the DSM-5-AUD latent classes. Results: The best latent-class model was a three-class model. We found a ""non-symptomatic class"" (69.7%), a ""use in larger amounts class"" (23.2%), defined by high probability (>70%) of the ""use in larger amounts"" criterion only, and a ""high-moderate symptomatic class"" (7.1%), defined by high-moderate probability of all the 11 AUD criteria. Compared to those in the non-symptomatic class, individuals in the ""high-moderate symptomatic class"" were more likely to have been married, have lower educational attainment and to be unemployed or in non-regular/informal employment. Those on the ""use in larger amounts class"" were more likely to have been married or never married. Conclusion: The two symptomatic classes clearly represented the dimensionality of the new proposed AUD criteria, and could be more specifically targeted by different prevention or treatment strategies. DSM-5-AUD has the advantage of shedding light on risky drinkers included in the ""use in larger amounts class"", allowing for preventive interventions, which will reach a large number of individuals. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.";Alcohol use disorders (AUD) | Brazil | DSM-5 criteria | Latent class analysis | São Paulo;17;0;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;002/2003;National Institute of Mental Health

The Pdx1 transcription factor plays a central role in pancreatic development and in insulin gene expression. Previously, we have demonstrated that Silymarin recovers the normal morphology and endocrine function of damaged pancreatic tissue in alloxan induced diabetic rats. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of Silymarin in Pdx1 gene expression and its repercussion on insulin gene expression and β-cell proliferation. 72 Wistar rats were partially pancreatectomized (60%) and divided into 12 groups. Six groups were treated daily with Silymarin (200 mg/kg p.o.) for 3, 7, 14, 21, 42 and 63 day periods. Also, an unpancreatectomized control group was performed. At each time interval three animals from each group were administered BrdU 18 h before the sacrifice. Insulin and Pdx-1 gene expression were assessed by RT-PCR assay in total pancreatic RNA. β-Cell proliferation was determined by immunoperoxidase assay. In contrast to the animals that were only pancreatectomized, the Silymarin treatment induced an increase in both Pdx1 and insulin gene expression as well as β-cell proliferation in pancreatic tissue (control = 2.6 ± 0.28%; untreated = 14.25 ± 0.56%; treated = 39.08 ± 4.62%). Consequently, serum insulin levels rose (control = 1.01 ± 0.02 ng/ml; untreated = 1.18 ± 0.42 ng/ml; treated = 4.58 ± 0.58 ng/ml) and serum glucose levels decreased in these animals (control = 6.2 ± 0.01 mM; untreated = 9.02 ± 0.41 mM; treated = 6.41 ± 0.32 mM). These results suggest that Silymarin may induce the proliferation of insulin-producing cells. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.";Insulin | Pancreatic regeneration | Pancreatic transcription factors | Silymarin;21;0;;;;undefined;

This acoustic imaging technique has been applied to diverse pulmonary conditions, but it is important to contribute to the understanding of RATHI characteristics, such as acoustic spatial distribution, dependence on airflow and variability. The purpose of the current study is to assess the intra-subject and inter-subject RATHI variabilities in a cohort of 12 healthy male subjects (24.3±1.5 years) using diverse quantitative indices. The indices were obtained directly from the acoustic image and did not require scores from human raters, which helps to prevent inter-observer variability. To generate the acoustic image, LSs were acquired at 25 positions on the posterior thoracic surface by means of airborne sound sensors with a wide frequency band from 75up to 1000Hz under controlled airflow conditions at 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0L/s. To assess intra-subject variability, the degree of similitude between inspiratory acoustic images was evaluated through quadratic mutual information based on the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality (ICS). The inter-subject variability was assessed by an image registration procedure between RATHIs and X-ray images to allow the computation of average and variance acoustic image in the same coordinate space. The results indicated that intra-subject RATHI similitude, reflected by I C S - g l o b a l, averaged 0.960±0.008, 0.958±0.008 and 0.960±0.007 for airflows of 1.0, 1.5, and 2L/s, respectively. As for the inter-subject variability, the variance image values for three airflow conditions indicated low image variability as they ranged from 0.01 to 0.04. In conclusion, the assessment of intra-subject and inter-subject variability by similitude indices indicated that the acoustic image pattern is repeatable along different respiratory cycles and across different subjects. Therefore, RATHI could be used to explore different aspects of spatial distribution and its association with regional pulmonary ventilation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.";Acoustic thoracic imaging | Breathing sounds | Inter-subject variability | Intra-subject variability | Mutual information;0;0;;;;undefined;

In addition to replicating previous findings, we identified a novel locus associated with type 2 diabetes at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P = 3.9 × 10-13; odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). The association was stronger in younger, leaner people with type 2 diabetes, and replicated in independent samples (P = 1.1 × 10-4; OR = 1.20). The risk haplotype carries four amino acid substitutions, all in SLC16A11; it is present at ∼50% frequency in Native American samples and ∼10% in east Asian, but is rare in European and African samples. Analysis of an archaic genome sequence indicated that the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals. The SLC16A11 messenger RNA is expressed in liver, and V5-tagged SLC16A11 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of SLC16A11 in heterologous cells alters lipid metabolism, most notably causing an increase in intracellular triacylglycerol levels. Despite type 2 diabetes having been well studied by genome-wide association studies in other populations, analysis in Mexican and Latin American individuals identified SLC16A11 as a novel candidate gene for type 2 diabetes with a possible role in triacylglycerol metabolism. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Phenotypes share clinical symptoms such as dyspnea and bronchial obstruction to air flow and an increase of innate immune cells (macrophages and neutrophils), the release of multiple inflammatory mediators (chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors), oxidative stress, increased extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the airways and lung. Disease progression is associated with the presence of chronic inflammation and increased proteolytic activity of enzymes such as MMPs resulting in the degradation of elastin and collagen fibers in the walls of the alveoli and the lung’s extracellular matrix. Of particular interest for this review was to describe the role of MMPs, their participation in the development of COPD, both in the extracellular matrix destruction and abnormal lung remodeling damaged. Also mentioned genetic association studies of polymorphisms in MMPs type SNP in Caucasian populations such as the development and progression of COPD, and the importance of carrying out studies in Mexican mestizo population. The role of MMPs has also been known through animal models and knockout mice MMPs exposed to cigarette smoke. All these studies implicate MMPs as key mediators in the pathogenesis of COPD. Finally, the study of MMPs base allow for future therapies, potential therapeutic targets and disease treatments.;COPD | MMPs | Polymorphism | SNP;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The eggs hatch after being ingested, penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate via the blood stream through to the liver, hence spread to other organs. Erratic larval migration by the different soft tissues in humans, generates four syndromes, Visceral Larva Migrans, Ocular Larva Migrans, neurotoxocariosis and covert toxocariosis. A seroprevalence study of Toxocara canis among students from Veterinary Medicine and Graphic Design in Mexico City was conducted, as the Veterinary student has regular contact with animals was compared with students who have no contact with animals in their study program. Materials, Methods & Results: In both groups of students blood samples were collected and centrifuged to obtain the serum was evaluated by Toxocara serology ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). All participants completed a questionnaire supplying personal data and specifics regarding dog ownership and hygiene practices. Serology data and results from the questionnaire were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test, Chi-square and odds ratio (OR) test. The frequency of Toxocara infection tended to be greater (P = 0.11) in veterinary students than in those from graphic design (13 % and 7.0 % respectively). Some of the risk factors that were considered were: do not wash your hands after eating, frequent contact with dogs, has dog at home, eating on the street and dewormed your dog, neither factor was associated nor were risk factors for Toxocara antibodies present. Discussion: The fact that almost twice as many veterinary students were seropositive indicates a higher risk of Toxocara canis infection in those individuals, which may be due to veterinary students having greater contact with sources of infection (animals, feces, soil, hair, and farms), regardless of the ownership of dogs. In a study in Canada researchers found no differences among veterinarians and other professionals in anti-Toxocara antibodies, finding similar values (8.8% and 9.6% respectively) in both, and also found no association between dog ownership and anti-Toxocara antibodies a study in Austria found that veterinarians were the second occupational groups that had more antibodies (27%) compared to the control group (2%) and the main source of infection was identified as cats and dogs. Many studies have shown that risk factors are very important in the epidemiology of toxocariosis, primarily the presence of dogs and cats living together with people. It has been reported higher infection in individuals who were in contact with dogs. In several cities of Mexico, highest percentages of dogs infested with Toxocara were reported, with a mean of 35.5% and a range from 19.0 to 63.36%. It has been reported up to 100% of stray puppies can be contaminated with Toxocara in samples collected from dorsal and perianal hair which constitutes a great potential of infection considered that 94% of the Toxocara eggs were embrionated. Other studies show less contamination of hair with eggs of T. canis (40.9%) but still shows the importance as a potential source of infection for humans. Eating in the street or poor hygiene before eating were not factors related to the disease. Although no association was found with the lack hand washing and Toxocara, other researchers have identified this problem as a risk factor associated with Toxocara. It can be assumed that depending on the degree of contamination by Toxocara exposed to each individual, the hygiene practices may have different impact on the presence of the parasite. The results indicate that veterinary students are more prone to infection with Toxocara.;Mexico | Ocurrence | Risk factors | Toxocara | Veterinary;4;0;;;;undefined;

A logic of accumulation of discomfort with social origin expressed in an act of abuse and mediated for a reason or conflict that justified the physical and/or verbal attack was described. Sometimes, the expression of discomfort was accompanied by guilt feelings after violent events. The expressive elements that allow abuses to partners and other family members are the beliefs about the superiority of men, the physical inferiority of women and children or the belief about their inferiority, the notion that wives are a property, the perception that relationships should last a lifetime, and beliefs about the use of violence in relationships. In terms of the intervention with this population, the study highlights the importance of considering the role of social determinants of distress from the macro level to the social programs and community interventions.;;3;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Seventeen healthy subjects performed 5-min maneuvers: lying, controlled breathing, standing (S) and exercise (E). Time-frequency spectra of RR intervals (RR), ΔZmax, dZ/dtmax and respiration (Res) time series were estimated to compute their low-frequency (LFΔZmax, LFdZ/dtmax) and high-frequency powers (HFRR, HFΔZmax, HFdZ/dtmax, HFRes) and the time-frequency coherences of HFRes with HFΔZmax and HFdZ/dtmax. HFRR and RR level decreased in S and E. LFΔZmax was negligible. HFΔZmax was maximal in E and showed significant coherences with HFRes. LFdZ/dtmax was maximal in E and decreased in S. HFdZ/dtmax was much greater than LFdZ/dtmax and showed significant coherences with HFRes. Because LFdZ/dtmax power is cardiac sympathetic activity and stroke volume dependent, it can be considered a noninvasive index of global left ventricular systolic function. HFdZ/dtmax power is originated by thoracic volume changes. The mechanical respiratory effect is the main source of ΔZmax and dZ/dtmax time series variability.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

In rare families, loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in PPARG are known to cosegregate with lipodystrophy and insulin resistance; in the general population, the common P12A variant is associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Whether and how rare variants in PPARG and defects in adipocyte differentiation influence risk of T2D in the general population remains undetermined. By sequencing PPARG in 19,752 T2D cases and controls drawn from multiple studies and ethnic groups, we identified 49 previously unidentified, nonsynonymous PPARG variants (MAF < 0.5%). Considered in aggregate (with or without computational prediction of functional consequence), these rare variants showed no association with T2D (OR = 1.35; P = 0.17). The function of the 49 variants was experimentally tested in a novel high-throughput human adipocyte differentiation assay, and nine were found to have reduced activity in the assay. Carrying any of these nine LOF variants was associated with a substantial increase in risk of T2D (OR = 7.22; P = 0.005). The combination of large-scale DNA sequencing and functional testing in the laboratory reveals that approximately 1 in 1,000 individuals carries a variant in PPARG that reduces function in a human adipocyte differentiation assay and is associated with a substantial risk of T2D.";;122;1;repositoryvor;Green;NHLBI;GM089652;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

BCC is invasive but rarely metastatic and originates in hair follicle-derived cells or interfollicular zones of the epidermis. Trichoblastoma (TB) is an infrequent benign skin neoplasm that differentiates toward follicular germinative cells. Both of these cutaneous lesions comprise nests of basaloid cells, and because the differential diagnosis is hard to obtain between them histologically due to their similarity, the correct diagnosis must be established. Materials and Methods: The sample size of this descriptive study consisted of 20 cases: 10 paraffin-embedded tissues that were diagnosed with carcinoma of solid basal cells with follicular differentiation and 10 TB tissues. The diagnosis of all samples was confirmed morphologically with hematoxylin and eosin. One-micron-thick sections were cut from each sample and analyzed semiquantitatively by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Differences in staining between BCC and TB were analyzed by Chi-square test. Results: Two of 10 TB cases were positive for Ki-67 versus 10 of 10 BCC samples. Cytokeratins 6 was expressed in 1 of 10 TB samples and in all BCC tissues. Staining with clone 34BE12 generated signals in all lesions at various intensities. Conclusion: The diagnosis between TBs and BCCs must be made histologically, because the treatment of BCC is radical and can compromise aesthetics and function, even for experienced pathologists. Because their morphological diagnosis is difficult, the histopathology results must be supported by an IHC panel. © 2014 International Journal of Trichology.;Basal cell carcinoma | immunohistochemistry | trichoblastoma;14;0;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Timely measurements of levels and trends in under-5 mortality are important to assess progress towards the Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG 4) target of reduction of child mortality by two thirds from 1990 to 2015, and to identify models of success. Methods: We generated updated estimates of child mortality in early neonatal (age 0-6 days), late neonatal (7-28 days), postneonatal (29-364 days), childhood (1-4 years), and under-5 (0-4 years) age groups for 188 countries from 1970 to 2013, with more than 29 000 survey, census, vital registration, and sample registration datapoints. We used Gaussian process regression with adjustments for bias and non-sampling error to synthesise the data for under-5 mortality for each country, and a separate model to estimate mortality for more detailed age groups. We used explanatory mixed effects regression models to assess the association between under-5 mortality and income per person, maternal education, HIV child death rates, secular shifts, and other factors. To quantify the contribution of these different factors and birth numbers to the change in numbers of deaths in under-5 age groups from 1990 to 2013, we used Shapley decomposition. We used estimated rates of change between 2000 and 2013 to construct under-5 mortality rate scenarios out to 2030. Findings: We estimated that 6·3 million (95% UI 6·0-6·6) children under-5 died in 2013, a 64% reduction from 17·6 million (17·1-18·1) in 1970. In 2013, child mortality rates ranged from 152·5 per 1000 livebirths (130·6-177·4) in Guinea-Bissau to 2·3 (1·8-2·9) per 1000 in Singapore. The annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2013 ranged from -6·8% to 0·1%. 99 of 188 countries, including 43 of 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, had faster decreases in child mortality during 2000-13 than during 1990-2000. In 2013, neonatal deaths accounted for 41·6% of under-5 deaths compared with 37·4% in 1990. Compared with 1990, in 2013, rising numbers of births, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, led to 1·4 million more child deaths, and rising income per person and maternal education led to 0·9 million and 2·2 million fewer deaths, respectively. Changes in secular trends led to 4·2 million fewer deaths. Unexplained factors accounted for only -1% of the change in child deaths. In 30 developing countries, decreases since 2000 have been faster than predicted attributable to income, education, and secular shift alone. Interpretation: Only 27 developing countries are expected to achieve MDG 4. Decreases since 2000 in under-5 mortality rates are accelerating in many developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The Millennium Declaration and increased development assistance for health might have been a factor in faster decreases in some developing countries. Without further accelerated progress, many countries in west and central Africa will still have high levels of under-5 mortality in 2030.;;537;0;repositoryam;Green;MRC;MR/K006525/1;Medical Research Council

Reconstructive techniques for which non-vaginal tissue is used can be associated with complications. We assessed the use of engineered vaginal organs in four patients with vaginal aplasia caused by Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS). Methods We invited to participate four consecutive patients who presented over a 3-year period with congenital vaginal aplasia due to MRKHS. Patients were aged 13-18 years. We obtained a vulvar biopsy of autologous tissue from every patient. We cultured, expanded, and seeded epithelial and muscle cells onto biodegradable scaff olds. The organs were constructed and allowed to mature in an incubator in a facility approved for human-tissue manufacturing. We used a perineal approach to surgically implant these organs. We recorded history, physical examination, vaginoscopy, serial tissue biopsies, MRIs, and self-administered Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire results for all patients, with a follow-up of up to 8 years. Findings We noted no long-term postoperative surgical complications. Yearly serial biopsies showed a tri-layered structure, consisting of an epithelial cell-lined lumen surrounded by matrix and muscle, with expected components of vaginal tissue present. Immunohistochemical analysis confi rmed the presence of phenotypically normal smooth muscle and epithelia. The MRIs, which showed the extent of the vaginal aplasia before surgery, showed the engineered organs and the absence of abnormalities after surgery, which was confi rmed with yearly vaginoscopy. A validated selfadministered Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire showed variables in the normal range in all areas tested, such as desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and painless intercourse. Interpretation Vaginal organs, engineered from the patient's own cells and implanted, showed normal structural and functional variables with a follow-up of up to 8 years. These technologies could be useful in patients requiring vaginal reconstruction. Funding Wake Forest University and Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez.;;159;0;;;;undefined;

To inform strategies to increase the number of insured within this population, we elicited immigrants' understanding of health insurance and preferences for coverage. Nine focus groups with Mexican immigrants were conducted across the State of North Carolina. Qualitative, descriptive methods were used to assess people's understanding of health insurance, identify their perceived need for health insurance, describe perceived barriers to obtaining coverage, and prioritize the components of insurance that immigrants value most. Individuals have a basic understanding of health insurance and perceive it as necessary. Participants most valued insurance that would cover emergencies, make care affordable, and protect family members. Barriers to obtaining insurance included cost, concerns about immigration status discovery, and communication issues. Strategies that address immigrants' preferences for and barriers to insurance should be considered. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;Health | Immigrant | Insurance | Mexican;5;0;;;;undefined;

It has a narrow therapeutic index and exhibits considerable interindividual and interethnic variability in clinical efficacy and adverse drug reactions including potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The most important pharmacogenetic finding is related to the association of CBZ-induced hypersensitivity with human leukocyte antigens (HLA class I and II alleles). Moreover, genotyping for HLAB 15:02 allele is required prior to initiating CBZ in Asians and Asian ancestry patients, demonstrating the usefulness of biomarkers to avoid adverse drug reactions. On the other hand, in order to explain the differences in the clinical response to CBZ, genetic polymorphisms in phase I (CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and EPHX1) and phase II (UGT2B7) metabolising enzymes have been assessed; additionally, the influence of transporters (ABCB1 and ABCC2), receptors (PXR) and other drug targets (voltage- gated Na+ channels) in CBZ clinical response has been evaluated. To date, these studies are controversial and require further investigations to clarify the functional role of these polymorphisms as potential biomarkers in regard to CBZ therapy.";Adverse drug reaction | Carbamazepine | Drug resistance | Genetic polymorphism | Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) | Pharmacogenetics;14;0;;;;undefined;

At present, the steady increment in the consumption of products and sub-products of this species has generated the need to increase the number of animals incorporated into production by progressively expanding the use of stabling systems, reducing the space available to these animals, and applying techniques developed previously for meat and milk production in bovines. However, because such adaptations often fail to take into account important biological and behavioural features of these animals, they may result in serious problems of animal welfare. On the other hand, it is known that water buffaloes adapt well to humid tropical climates, especially in systems that provide extensive, continuous pastureland. These species are highly susceptible to thermal stress, a fact that leads them to constantly perform wallowing behaviour. For all these reasons, open-air and, above all, silvopastoral, systems represent attractive options because they combine the presence of forage plants with trees that provide natural shade and serve as wind barriers, thus attenuating the negative effects of tropical climes. These measures help increase productivity by promoting greater forage consumption and fostering the expression of the species' natural behaviours, but the reduction in human contact affects their welfare. Hence, this review concludes that welfare is a fundamental concept that must be taken into account in the development of systems for water buffalo production.;Animal welfare | Outdoor systems | Production systems | Productivity | Stress;18;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;515743;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The representative sample comprised a subsample (N = 2,362) of the urban participants of the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey (2001-2002). We used the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to assess exposure to trauma and the presence of PTSD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, ) in each respondents' self-reported worst traumatic event, as well as a randomly selected lifetime trauma. The results showed that traumatic events were extremely common in Mexico (68.8%). The estimate of lifetime PTSD in the whole population was 1.5%; among only those with a traumatic event it was 2.1%. The 12-month prevalence of PTSD in the whole population was 0.6%; among only those with a traumatic event it was 0.8%. Violence-related events were responsible for a large share of PTSD. Sexual violence, in particular, was one of the greatest risks for developing PTSD. These findings support the idea that trauma in Mexico should be considered a public health concern. © 2014 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies 27 3 June 2014 10.1002/jts.21917 Research Article Research Articles Copyright © 2014 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.";;13;0;;;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

The World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys allow investigation of the implications of the changing criteria compared to DSM-IV and ICD-10. Methods: WMH Surveys in 13 countries asked respondents to enumerate all their lifetime traumatic events (TEs) and randomly selected one TE per respondent for PTSD assessment. DSMIV and ICD-10 PTSD were assessed for the 23,936 respondents who reported lifetime TEs in these surveys with the fully structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). DSM-5 and proposed ICD-11 criteria were approximated. Associations of the different criteria sets with indicators of clinical severity (distress-impairment, suicidality, comorbid fear-distress disorders, PTSD symptom duration) were examined to investigate the implications of using the different systems. Results: A total of 5.6% of respondents met criteria for ""broadly defined"" PTSD (i.e., full criteria in at least one diagnostic system), with prevalence ranging from 3.0% with DSM-5 to 4.4% with ICD-10. Only one-third of broadly defined cases met criteria in all four systems and another one third in only one system (narrowly defined cases). Between-system differences in indicators of clinical severity suggest that ICD-10 criteria are least strict and DSM-IV criteria most strict. The more striking result, though, is that significantly elevated indicators of clinical significance were found even for narrowly defined cases for each of the four diagnostic systems. Conclusions: These results argue for a broad definition of PTSD defined by any one of the different systems to capture all clinically significant cases of PTSD in future studies. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.";DSM-5 | DSM-IV | Epidemiology | ICD-10 | ICD-11 | Nosology | Posttraumatic stress disorder | World mental health surveys;133;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;K01MH092526;National Institutes of Health

Blood pressure regulation is the basis for syncope development. In this regulation, the α1a-adrenergic receptor plays a major role. Some studies have found a positive correlation between the Arg347Cys polymorphism of the α1a-adrenergic receptor to hypertension and heart autonomic control. The goal of this study is to evaluate the possible association between the Arg347Cys α1a-adrenergic receptor polymorphism and vasovagal syncope in a Mexican population. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;Adrenergic receptor | Autonomic nervous system | Genes | Syncope;17;0;;;;undefined;

The heart/lung rate was calculated using the SPECT images information. There were no statistically significant differences between the heart/lung rates values of a group of patients diagnosed with IE (2.62±0.47) and a group of healthy or control subjects (2.84±0.68). However, it is necessary to increase the study sample of both the individuals diagnosed with IE and the control group subjects, as well as to improve the images quality. © 2014 SPIE.;Infective endocarditis | Mean-shift | SPECT/CT images;0;0;;;;undefined;

It is becoming increasingly clear that estradiol (E2) induces breast cancer cell progression and enhances EMT; however, the mechanisms associated with this are unclear. We investigated the role of E2 on the expression and intracellular localization of the tight junction (TJ)-associated proteins, zonula occluden 1 (ZO-1), ZO-1-associated nucleic acid binding (ZONAB), and occludin, on the activation of c-Src and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression and cellular migration in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D. We demonstrated that 1 nM E2 elicits c-Src activation after 15 min. The p-Src/ZO-1 complex led to ZO-1 and ZONAB disruption at the TJ and increased expression of HER2 mRNAs. These changes correlate with decreased expression of the epithelial markers occludin and CRB3 and increased synthesis of N-cadherin. This led to increased MCF-7 cell migration induced by E2, even in the presence of a cell proliferation inhibitor. Incubation with ICI 182,780 (Fulvestrant), an ER antagonist, precluded the effects of E2 on c-Src phosphorylation, p-Src/ZO-1 complex formation, ZO-1/ZONAB nuclear translocation, and migration of MCF-7 cells. Our findings suggest that E2 promotes TJ disruption during tumor progression and increases cell motility.

A more detailed time-frequency representation could lead to a better feature extraction for diseases classification and stratification purposes, among others. In this respect, the aim of this study was to look for an omnibus technique to obtain the time-frequency representation (TFR) of thoracic sounds by comparing generic goodness-of-fit criteria in different simulated thoracic sounds scenarios. The performance of ten TFRs for heart, normal tracheal and adventitious lung sounds was assessed using time-frequency patterns obtained by mathematical functions of the thoracic sounds. To find the best TFR performance measures, such as the 2D local (ρmean) and global (ρ) central correlation, the normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), the cross-correlation coefficient (ρIF) and the time-frequency resolution (resTF) were used. Simulation results pointed out that the Hilbert-Huang spectrum (HHS) had a superior performance as compared with other techniques and then, it can be considered as a reliable TFR for thoracic sounds. Furthermore, the goodness of HHS was assessed using noisy simulated signals. Additionally, HHS was applied to first and second heart sounds taken from a young healthy male subject, to tracheal sound from a middle-age healthy male subject, and to abnormal lung sounds acquired from a male patient with diffuse interstitial pneumonia. It is expected that the results of this research could be used to obtain a better signature of thoracic sounds for pattern recognition purpose, among other tasks. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;Adventitious lung sounds | Heart sounds | Hilbert-Huang spectrum | Time-frequency analysis | Tracheal sounds;21;0;;;;undefined;

Knowing the foot strike patterns of the runners has become necessary since there is a possible relationship between the landing pattern of the foot against the ground during running and the increased incidence of musculoskeletal injuries in runners. Research question: The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of the foot strike patterns in recreational runners during typical training running pace. Type of study: Cross-sectional study. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted with recreational runners who practice with running coach. A high-speed camera (image acquisition frequency of 250 Hz) was used to analyse the foot strike pattern and photocells were used to register the runnerś speed. The foot strike patterns were classified into three categories: rearfoot, midfoot and forefoot. The description of the foot strike pattern and the characteristics of participants were done through descriptive statistics. Intra-class and inter-class confiability was evaluated by agreement percentage. Results: Fifty-three runners, with an average speed of 12.6 km/h, were evaluated, and 98.1% of the runners showed a rearfoot strike pattern. Only one runner touched the ground with the midfoot first, and none were forefoot strikers. The evaluation method for determining foot strike pattern showed an agreement percentage of 96.2% and 100% intra-class and inter-class confiability, respectively. Conclusion: The results of the study showed that the adult recreational runners who train with a one running coach, almost exclusively demonstrate a rearfoot strike pattern during running.;Foot strike | Injuries | Landing | Prevention | Running;0;0;;;;undefined;

Here, we report the prevalence of sequence and structural mutations in these three main recessive genes in Mexican Mestizo patients. The complete sequences of these three genes were analyzed by homo/heteroduplex DNA formation and direct sequencing; exon dosage was determined by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and real-time PCR in 127 patients belonging to 122 families and 120 healthy Mexican Mestizo controls. All individuals had been previously screened for the three most common LRRK2 mutations. The presence of two mutations in compound heterozygous or homozygous genotypes was found in 16 unrelated patients, 10 had mutations in PARK2, six in PINK1, and none in DJ-1. Two PARK2-PINK1 and one PARK2-LRRK2 digenic cases were observed. Novel mutations were identified in PARK2 and PINK1 genes, including PINK1 duplication for the first time. Exon dosage deletions were the most frequent mutations in PARK2 (mainly in exons 9 and 12), followed by those in PINK1. The high prevalence of heterozygous mutations in PARK2 (12.3%) and the novel heterozygous and homozygous point mutations in PINK1 observed in familial and sporadic cases from various states of Mexico support the concept that single heterozygous mutations in recessive Parkinson's disease genes play a pathogenic role. These data have important implications for genetic counseling of Mexican Mestizo patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease. The presence of digenic inheritance underscores the importance of studying several genes in this disease. A step-ordered strategy for molecular diagnosis is proposed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.";Digenic inheritance | DJ-1 | Early-onset Parkinson's disease | PARK2 | PINK1;9;0;;;;undefined;

Yet the role that alcoholic beverage preferences and the drinking context play in the risk for injury is still under-investigated. In this study, a cross-national comparison of the association between alcohol and injury focusing on beverage type preference and the drinking context is reported. Methods: Emergency department (ED) injured patients were interviewed in eight countries from the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region. Data on the type of alcoholic beverage, total alcohol volume, and the place where the injury occurred were obtained from patients who reported any alcohol consumption within 6. h prior to being injured. Patients who did not drink prior to injury were also asked about their typical drinking pattern and the injury place. Differences within- and between-groups were evaluated regarding patients' typical drinking and drinking before injury. Results: Beer was the most prevalent beverage type usually consumed among injured patients across countries, however, patients who drank before injury had a higher typical consumption of spirits than those not drinking prior to injury. The total alcohol volume typically consumed and drinking in public settings were also found to be positively associated with alcohol-related injury. Conclusions: A similar beverage-specific association with alcohol-related injury was found across LAC countries, mainly attributed to beer consumption, and spirits drinkers seem to have a greater chance of becoming involved in injury events. Future prevention strategies should inform the public about harms from drinking associated with the context in which drinking takes place. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;Alcoholic beverage | Drinking | Emergency department | Injuries | Latin America;12;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;P50AA005595;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

The information available on time and dose effects of the exposure of hepatocytes to free fatty acids (FFA) in vitro is controversial, and very few studies have assessed the hepatocyte inflammatory response in an in vitro model. Aim. To analyze the effect of treatment with FFA on cell viability and on the kinetics of cytokine expression using hepatic cell lines. Material and methods. Hepatic cell lines, IHH and HuH7, were cultured for 3 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h in an enriched medium with palmitic and oleic acids. The cytotoxicity of the FFA was assessed by the MTT test and the intracellular fat content determined cytofluorimetrically and by fluorescence microscopy using Nile Red staining. The expression of mRNA for interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was assessed by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results. Treatment with 600 μM FFA did not affect the viability of either cell line despite a significant increase in the intracellular content of lipid droplets already evident after 3 h of treatment. A time- and dose-dependent upregulation of the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA was observed during the treatment at 3 and 24 h. In contrast, TNF-α mRNA expression was highly upregulated at 3 h after FFA exposure but returned to control values at 24 h. In conclusion, hepatocytes exposed in vitro for a short time to low FFA concentrations showed a significant upregulation of IL-6 and IL-8 to, and a rapid but transitory elevation of TNF-α.;Fatty liver | Liver | Molecular biology;14;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

Cellular adhesion potentially plays an important role in the manifestation of these characteristics and in the tumor biology of ameloblastomas. Losses of cell-cell and extracellular matrix adhesion and cohesion are among the frst events that occur in the invasion and growth of tumors of epithelial origin. The present review includes a description of the molecules that are involved in cell adhesion as reported for various types of ameloblastomas and discusses the possible roles of these molecules in the biological behaviors of this odontogenic tumor. Knowledge of the complex mechanisms in which these molecules play a role is critical for the research and discovery of future therapeutic targets. © Medicina Oral S.

However, less is known about injuries when alcohol is used in combination with other drugs. Design and Methods: Self-report information was collected on alcohol and illicit drug use in the 6h before a violence-related injury in probability samples of patients presenting to emergency departments (n=9686). Results: Patients with violence-related injuries reported the highest rates of alcohol use (49% of men; 23% of women) and alcohol use combined with illicit drugs (8% of men; 4% of women) whereas non-violent injury patients reported lower rates of alcohol use (17% of men; 8% of women) and alcohol use combined with drugs (2% for men; 1% for women). Marijuana/hashish was the most commonly reported drug. The odds of a violent injury were increased when alcohol was used [men: odds ratio (OR)=5.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6-6.3; women: OR=4.0, 95% CI 3.0-5.5] or when alcohol was combined with illicit drug use before the injury (men: OR=6.6, 95% CI 4.7-9.3; women: OR=5.7, 95% CI=2.7-12.2) compared with non-users. No significant change in the odds of a violent injury was observed for men or women when alcohol users were compared with alcohol and drug users. Discussion and Conclusions: The positive association between alcohol and violent injury does not appear to be altered by the added use of drugs. Additional work is needed to understand the interpersonal, contextual and cultural factors related to substance use to identify best prevention practices and develop appropriate policies. © 2013 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.";Alcohol and illicit drug use | Emergency department | Gender differences | Violence-related injury;29;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;P50AA005595;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

The effect of CBO was evaluated on mice with diarrhea induced by castor oil, MgSO arachidonic acid, or prostaglandin E CBO inhibited the contraction induced by carbachol chloride on ileum (100 μg/mL) and intestinal transit (200 mg/kg) in Wistar rats. The active fraction of CBO (F4) at doses of 100 mg/kg inhibited the diarrhea induced by castor oil (90.1%) or arachidonic acid (72.9%) but did not inhibit the diarrhea induced by PGE The active fraction of F4 (FR5) only was tested on diarrhea induced with castor oil and inhibited this diarrhea by 92.1%. The compositions of F4 and FR5 were determined by GC-MS, and oleic, palmitic, linoleic, and stearic acids were found. F4 and a mixture of the four fatty acids inhibited diarrhea at doses of 100 mg/kg (90.1% and 70.6%, resp.).

From the time-frequency distribution (TFD) of RR intervals (RR) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP), low-frequency power of RR (LFRR), high-frequency power of RR (HFRR), low-to-high-frequency ratio (LF RR/HFRR) and lowfrequency power of SAP (LFSAP) were computed. BRS instantaneous values, obtained by the alpha index from the low-frequency band, can be separated into a nonfluctuating part, mean BRS (BRSm), and a variable part, BRSV. The TFD of BRSV showed a single component in the very low-frequency band (VLFBRS). Correlations of both HFRR and mean RR (RRm) with VLFBRS and BRSm ranged from 0.89 to 0.90. RRm-BRSm correlation was greater (p<0.01) than the non-significant RR m-LFRR/HFRR correlation (-0.38±0.39). BRSm and VLFBRS power are strongly correlated to each other and to vagal activity, and are better indexes of sympathovagal balance than the usual LFRR/HFRR ratio. © 2013 CCAL.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

From the time-frequency spectra of RR intervals (RR), impedance heart period (IHP), IHP-RR difference, ejection time (ET) and diastolic time (DT) series, their corresponding high frequency (HFRR, HFIHP-RR) and low frequency powers (LFRR, LFIHP-RR) were computed. Time-frequency coherences of HFRR and LFRR with the respective components of the other series were obtained. Coherences and correlations of HRV spectral measures with those of IHPV and DTV were very strong and much greater (p<0.01) than with those of ETV. HFIHP-RR power was much greater (p<0.005) than LFIHP-RR in all maneuvers. Although HRV determines most IHPV, the latter contains additional respiratory modulation that limits their interchangeability. Intra-beat variability is documented by DTV, a surrogate of HRV and therefore susceptible to autonomic modulation, and by ETV, which is much reduced and less responsive to modulation. © 2013 CCAL.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

Surprisingly, little data about health benefits and cost of APD exist, and virtually no information comparing the cost-utility between CAPD and APD is available. We undertook this study to evaluate and compare the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and cost-utility indexes in patients on CAPD vs. APD. Methods: This was a prospective cohort of patients initiating dialysis (2008-2009). Two questionnaires were self-administered: European Research Questionnaire Quality of Life (EQ-5D) and Kidney Disease Quality of Life (short form, KDQOL-SF, Rand, Santa Monica, CA). Direct medical costs (DMC) were determined from the health provider perspective including the following medical resource utilization: outpatient clinic/emergency care, dialysis procedures, medications, laboratory tests, hospitalization, and surgery. Cost-utility indexes were calculated dividing total mean cost by indicators of the HRQOL. Results: One hundred twenty-three patients were evaluated: 77 on CAPD and 46 on APD. Results of the EQ-5D and KDQOL-SF questionnaires were significantly better in APD compared to the CAPD group. Main costs in both APD and CAPD were attributed to hospitalization and dialysis procedures followed by medication and surgery. Outpatient clinic visits and laboratory tests were significantly more costly in CAPD than in APD, whereas dialysis procedures were more expensive in the latter. Cost-utility indexes were significantly better in APD compared to CAPD. Conclusions: A significant cost-utility advantage of APD vs. CAPD was observed. The annual DMC per-patient were not different between groups but the HRQOL was better in the APD compared to the CAPD group. © 2013 IMSS.;Automated peritoneal dialysis | Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis | Cost-utility index | Direct medical costs | Quality of life | Utilities;11;0;;;;undefined;

In fact, recently their 2D spatial distribution (SD) imaging has been proposed to help diagnose of pulmonary diseases. In this work, independent component analysis (ICA) by infomax was used to find crackles sources and from them to apply a time variant autoregressive model (TVAR) to count and imaging the ALS. The proposed methodology was assessed on multichannel LS recordings by embedding simulated fine crackles with known SD in recorded normal breathing sounds. Afterwards, the adventitious image of two patients with fibrosis and emphysema were obtained and contrasted with the classical pulmonary auscultation provided by a pneumologist. The results showed that combining ICA and TVAR leads to a robust methodology to imaging ALS. © 2013 IEEE.;;8;0;;;;undefined;

The goal was to investigate the differences in the contractions generated by women that evolve labor to a vaginal delivery (group 1) to those associated with caesarean section (group 2). Abdominal signals were acquired using Ag-AgCl electrodes in a bipolar configuration and the EHG was obtained by band-pass filtering in the range of 0.3 to 4 Hz. Sample entropy (SampEn) was used to calculate the irregularity of manually selected contractions of the EHG time series. The results showed that it is plausible to discriminate contractions from both groups as the average SampEn was 2.1359 with a standard deviation of 0.0583 for group 1 (N=8), while for group 2 (N=8) was 2.0352 with standard deviation of 0.0946; it was found significant statistical difference between groups as p was 0.046.

Social Networks certainly have changed communication habits, especially among young people. Nowadays, Social Networks are used as a communication system every day. In most countries, university students use this communication and interaction media to share information, images, videos, music, etc. but essentially, they use Social Network to socialize. In Mexico, probably more than 90% of the students between 17 and 25 years old have their own Facebook space. In this way, almost every student in the university knows how to use the social network, especially Facebook, nevertheless, none of them knows how to use virtual classrooms like Moodle, for example. This is a big problem for universities which are interested in using virtual classrooms. That is the case of Metropolitan Autonomous University, in Mexico City that is interested in using Moodle to support academic activities. That is why we decided to change the paradigm: if we can't take students to virtual classroom, we can take classroom to students. In this way we empowered Facebook as a virtual classroom. In this paper we describe our experience in using Facebook, no just as a communication media, but as a real virtual classroom, in a public university in Mexico City.;B-learning | E-learning | Educative Facebook | Social Networks;0;0;;;;undefined;

At present, other techniques such as multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) are used to estimate visceral fat in the clinical setting. The purpose of this study was to compare this technique with the gold standard that is measurement of visceral fat by imaging techniques. In this instance we carried out a study comparing BIA with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In order to do this expeditiously for several studies, we developed a semi automatic segmentation method based on the mean shift filtering technique. A Bland-Altman study was carried out to ascertain if this technique was comparable to the gold standard. Results show that both techniques are not comparable and that BIA technique is very susceptible to the influence of subcutaneous fat, and that indeed it is only linear for a narrow range of subjects © 2013 IEEE.;body fat composition | impedance measurements | MRI | visceral fat measurements;1;0;;;;undefined;

In the case of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), it is important to have elements that respond in a punctual and timely way to the patient demands given he/she is in a high vulnerability state. The technological resources in ICU are essential for the patient to receive the needed care in life support and monitoring. In this work a first approach to quality assessment in the ICU through the implementation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) on the use and management of medical technology was developed. Six KPIs were defined covering aspects of Quality Service, Reliability, Credibility, Competitiveness, Security, Accessibility, and Communication, and were applied to three different hospital ICUs. The results showed which elements should be prioritized and led to the development of practical measures to improve the medical technology's performance. It also identified areas of opportunity to provide intensive care clinical areas with better control and quality standards, implementing procedures for review and verification of information. © 2013 IEEE.;ICU | medical technology | performance | quality;0;0;;;;undefined;

OBJECTIVE.: To verify the feasibility of performing in vivo quantitative magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of moderate traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats using a clinical 3T scanner. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Animal models of human diseases are essential for translational medicine. Potential treatments of SCI are evaluated in 2 ways: anatomical and functional. Advanced magnetic resonance sequences allow a noninvasive assessment of the spinal cord depicting both. This study describes and validates a very reproducible, feasible, affordable, and reliable method, designed to be applied in commercial 3T equipment, using a novel stereotactic device for spinal cord, leading to a readily available assessment of the progression of damage generated after traumatic SCI in rats. METHODS.: Four Long-Evans female rats were injured with a New York University weight-drop device to produce the SCI by contusion at thoracic level 10. All animals were placed in a fixation system, using a commercial wrist antenna to obtain magnetic resonance imaging data of the relaxometry time, apparent diffusion coefficient, and fractional anisotropy. Three sets of data obtained before SCI and 1 and 4 weeks after injury were compared. RESULTS.: The data showed a progressive decline in fractional anisotropy measurements after SCI comparing baseline versus the 1-week period (P < 0.001) and baseline versus the 4-week period (P < 0.019), with a significant progressive increase in apparent diffusion coefficient values and T2 after SCI only in the baseline versus the 4-week period (P < 0.045 and P < 0.024, respectively). CONCLUSION.: Our results helped us to validate a novel method to acquire highly reproducible and reliable quantitative biomarkers of traumatic SCI in vivo by using a 3T clinical MR scanner coupled with a novel stereotactic device for rats.

This work explores the issue of alcohol recall bias used in the case-crossover design. Design and Methods: Data were collected on injury patients from emergency room studies across six countries (Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama and Canada), conducted in 2009-2011, each with n≈500 except Canada (n=249). Recall bias was evaluated comparing drinking during two control periods: the same six hours period the day before versus the week before injury. Results: A greater likelihood of drinking yesterday compared with last week was seen using data from the Dominican Republic, while lower likelihood of drinking yesterday was found in Guatemala and Nicaragua. When the data from all six countries were combined, no differential drinking between the two control periods was observed. Discussion and Conclusions: These findings are in contrast to earlier studies showing a downward recall bias of drinking, and suggest that it may be premature to dismiss the last week case-crossover method as a valid approach to estimating risk of injury related to drinking. However, the heterogeneity across countries suggests that there may be some unexplained measurement error beyond random sampling error. [Ye Y, Bond JC, Cherpitel CJ, Borges G, Monteiro M, Vallance K.

The sera were obtained between 2000 and 2009. Objectives: The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis of the 2000-2009 period to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against pH1N1, hH1N1, swH1N1, and swH3N2 viruses in sera obtained from backyard pigs in Mexico City. Methods: Antibody detection was conducted with hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) using four influenza viruses. We used linear regression to analyze the tendency of antibody serum titers throughout the aforementioned span. Results: We observed that the antibody titers for the pH1N1, swH1N1, and swH3N2 viruses tended to diminish over the study period, whereas the antibodies to hH1N1 remained at low prevalence for the duration of the years analyzed in this study. A non-significant correlation (P > 0·05) between antibody titers for pH1N1 and swH1N1 viruses was observed (0·04). It contrasts with the significance of the correlation (0·43) observed between the swH1N1 and swH3N2 viruses (P < 0·01). Conclusions: Our findings showed no cross-antigenicity in the antibody response against the same subtype. Antibodies against pH1N1 virus were observed throughout the 10-year study span, implying that annual strains shared some common features with the pH1N1 virus since 2000, which would then be capable of supporting the ongoing presence of these antibodies. © John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;Backyard swine systems | Influenza viruses | Seroprevalence pH1N1-hH3N2-swH1N1-swH3N2;10;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

We examined differences in the use of mental health services, conditional on the presence of psychiatric disorders, across groups of Mexico's population with different US migration exposure and in successive generations of Mexican Americans in the United States. Methods. We merged surveys conducted in Mexico (Mexican National Comorbidity Survey, 2001-2002) and the United States (Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys, 2001-2003). We compared psychiatric disorders and mental health service use, assessed in both countries with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, across migration groups. Results. The 12-month prevalence of any disorder was more than twice as high among third-and higher generation Mexican Americans (21%) than among Mexicans with no migrant in their family (8%). Among people with a disorder, the odds of receiving any mental health service were higher in the latter group relative to the former (odds ratio = 3.35; 95% confidence interval = 1.82, 6.17) but the age-and gender-adjusted prevalence of untreated disorder was also higher.

The diagnosis and management of HIV disease and spectrum of opportunistic infection has changed over the past 30 years as our understanding of the infection has evolved. We investigated the following controversial topics: (i) Are oral manifestations of HIV still relevant after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)? (ii) Can we nowadays still diagnose HIV infection through oral lesions? (iii) Is the actual classification of oral manifestations of HIV adequate or does it need to be reviewed and updated? (iv) Is there any novelty in the treatment of oral manifestations of HIV infection? Results from extensive literature review suggested the following: (i) While HAART has resulted in significant reductions in HIV-OLs, many are still seen in patients with HIV infection, with OC remaining the most common lesion. While the relationship between oral warts and the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is less clear, the malignant potential of oral human papillomavirus infection is gaining increasing attention. (ii) Effective antiretroviral therapy has transformed HIV from a fatal illness to a chronic manageable condition and as a result expanded screening policies for HIV are being advocated both in developed and in developing countries. Affordable, reliable, and easy-to-use diagnostic techniques have been recently introduced likely restricting the importance of HIV-OLs in diagnosis. (iii) The 1993 EC-Clearinghouse classification of HIV-OLs is still globally used despite controversy on the relevance of periodontal diseases today. HIV-OL case definitions were updated in 2009 to facilitate the accuracy of HIV-OL diagnoses by non-dental healthcare workers in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical trials. (iv) Research over the last 6 years on novel modalities for the treatment of HIV-OLs has been reported for OC and OHL. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In normal anesthetized dog and sheep, a focal magnetic field was directed toward the facial nerve within the temporal bone by placing a 6.5 cm figure-8 stimulation coil over the ear. In an initial set of experiments, CBF was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry and the cerebral vasculature was visualized by angiography. The effect of facial nerve stimulation was found to be dependent on stimulation power, frequency, and the precise positioning of the stimulation coil. Furthermore, an increase in CBF was not observed after direct electrical stimulation in the middle ear space, indicating that non-specific stimulation of the tympanic plexus, an intervening neural structure with vasoactive effects, was not responsible for the increase in CBF after pulsed magnetic stimulation. Subsequent experiments using perfusion MRI demonstrated reproducible increases in CBF throughout the forebrain that manifested bilaterally, albeit with an ipsilateral predominance. These experiments support the development of a non-invasive pulsed magnetic facial nerve stimulator that will increase CBF as a treatment of ischemic stroke. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;Cerebral blood flow | Facial nerve | Magnetic stimulation;13;0;;;;undefined;Henrietta B. and Frederick H.

The international comparison is used to interrogate whether such a practice model is transnational, displaying shared characteristics that transcend contextual differences. Methods: The study used multi-site ethnography to investigate the participatory practice of more than 40 artists. Participant observation and extended individual and group dialogues provided data on practice in a diverse range of art forms and settings, analysed using open coding and grounded theory principles. Results: Findings locate differences in practitioners' motivations, and perceptions of the work's function; however, key similarities emerge across both sites, in practitioners' workshop methodologies and crucially in their creative strategies for catalysing change. A model is presented distilling the key elements of a common practice methodology, found across the study and across art forms. Conclusions: The discussion notes where divergences echo nationalities of contributors, drawing inferences about the level of influence of national context in this work, and concludes with the implications of these findings for potential international collaboration, to face challenges within the community arts and health sector globally. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.";Community arts and health | Ethnographic methodology | International comparative research | Mexico | Practice mechanisms;2;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Genetic polymorphisms of these enzymes have a key role in this variability. However, environmental factors, endogenous metabolism and disease states also have a great influence on the actual drug metabolism rate (metabolic phenotype). Consequently, the genotype does not always correlate with the actual drug hydroxylation phenotype. In this sense, in vivo phenotyping strategies represent an alternative to evaluate the interindividual variability in drug metabolism. Therefore, the 'cocktail' approach is considered as an advantageous strategy to obtain actual and reliable information on several CYP activities in just one experiment. As reviewed, phenotyping studies on Latin-American populations, which comprise about 400 million people, are scarce, and only selective phenotyping methods were applied. Therefore, a novel cocktail approach is here proposed as a phenotyping tool to evaluate the relationship between genotype and phenotype of major CYP enzymes in Hispanic populations. This determination will allow adaptation of drug therapies to these populations and consequently to benefit from the application of pharmacogenetics in the reduction of drug adverse effects and in the improvement of therapeutic responses.;Cocktail | Cytochrome P450 (CYP) | Genotype | Hispanics | Phenotype;14;0;;;;undefined;

The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of two strains to invade two endothelial cell types. Tachyzoites of the RH and ME49 strains were expanded in Balb/c and C57BL6-RAG2-/- mice, respectively. Tachyzoites were harvested from 72 h Vero cell cultures and incubated for 30 min to 4 h at 10:1 parasite/cell ratio in 24-well plates, containing monolayers of either HMEC-1 line or human umbilical cells (HUVECs). The number of infected cells and parasitic vacuoles per infected cell were counted in Wright stained slides. A slow increase in the proportion of infected cells occurred but varied according to cell type-parasite strain combination: ME49 tachyzoites invaded up to 63 % HMEC-1 cells, while RH parasites infected up to 19 % HUVECs. ME49 and RH tachyzoites invaded 49 and 46 % HUVECs and HMEC-1 cells, respectively. Reinvasion and formation of new parasitophorous vacuoles of infected cells was more frequent than invasion of noninfected cells. The results support that the factors influencing invasion, and thus dissemination and vertical transmission, are parasite type, host cell type/subtype, and activation state. Interestingly, T. gondii virulence does not seem to relay on its invasion efficiency, but probably on replication speed.

This paper shows the results of the assessment of microbiological potential of I. fumosorosea on the control of B. tabaci. Five application of the fungus were made at seven day intervals, at a rate of 5×109 conidia/g. The susceptibilities of eggs, nymphs of first, second and third instar, pupae and adults were evaluated. The nymphal, egg, and pupa stages were highly susceptible to the mycoinsecticide effect; however, the pathogenicity was very low in adults. The number of dead nymphs showed an increasing trend during the assessment, reaching a mortality of ∼70% in the last application, while it was <30% in adults. Regression analysis revealed a high correlation (R2≥0.90, P≤0.05) between dead individuals of the nymphal and egg stages in relation to the climatic variable environmental humidity, suggesting that the mortality of both states is highly dependent on the increase in humidity; although this high correlation was not observed on the pupa and adult stages. The results indicate that I. fumosorosea has the potential for microbial control of whitefly infestation of beans crops in the eggs, pupae, and nymphal stage, contrasting with the adults, which showed a very low susceptibility.";;1;0;;;;undefined;

The purpose of the current study was to determine whether or not the theorized components of measured dimensions of suicide risk and psychopathology vary across samples of Italians and immigrants. Methods: We investigated 237 Italians and 234 immigrants, who were administered self-report questionnaires to assess temperament (TEMPS-A), hopelessness (BHS), personality (EPQ-R), and self-other perception (9AP). Results: Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses were conducted, which yielded a final model with an excellent fit to the data (χ (53)2 = 57.56; CFI = 0.994; RMSEA = 0.014). This final model fits significantly better than the previously tested models and indicated that the same pattern of relationships was found between suicide risk and psychopathology across both groups. Conclusions: Although immigrants represent a unique population and may experience specific stressors contributing to psychopathology and suicide risk, our findings suggest that the samples of Italians and immigrants may be more similar on the study variables under investigation than previously thought. Implications are offered for the improved identification and treatment of immigrants and resident citizens in Europe in general and in Italy in particular. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.";Hopelessness | Immigration | Multi-group CFA | Personality | Self-other perception | Temperament;13;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The objective of this study was to compare the anaesthetic effects of clove oil, saline solution and colloidal solution (Pentabiocare) on juvenile Chirostoma jordani. 18 C. jordani specimens aged two months old were used for each treatment. Treatments consisted on clove oil at four concentrations (5, 8, 13 and 25 μL/L), saline solution at 7 g/L and colloidal solution at 5 mL/L. The anaesthesia stages and recovery time of fish were recorded during a six hour period. High concentrations of clove oil and prolonged exposure to it were associated with deep stages of anaesthesia. Clove oil in a concentration of 25 μL/L induced fish to stage three and after three hours of being exposed they entered stage five, while those sedated with saline and colloidal solutions were induced to stage one and showed the longest sedation times (six hours). Recovery time in juveniles when using 25 μL/L clove oil concentration was extended to 3,006.0 ± 5.3 seconds, while fish exposed to saline and colloidal solution showed a recovery of opercular rhythm, responsiveness to external stimuli and active swimming within 60 to 180 seconds. The results indicated that colloidal and saline solution kept the C. jordani juveniles in a state of light sedation during a six hours period with brief intervals of recovery. The use of clove oil at 5 and 13 μL/L doses induced juveniles to light and deep anaesthesia stages, respectively, with a recovery time under 420 seconds. © 2013 Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias.;Anesthesia | Chirostoma jordani | Clove oil | Saline solutions;4;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The evaluated techniques included the walking line transect and the driving line transect under two vegetation types and relative to season. The true population value (control) used to evaluate the techniques was a complete census using flights conducted over the entire study area (8000 ha). On grassland vegetation, the walking transect overestimates pronghorn density (n/km2), compared with the control (0.77 vs. 0.18 n/km2), as well as in the mesquite-grassland vegetation where the walking transect overestimates density (0.26 n/km2) compared with the control (0.11 n/km2). An increase in overestimation was found in the walking technique as the number of pronghorns in an area increased. In contrast, the driving technique showed no significant differences (P>0.05) compared with the control, in both grassland and mesquite-grassland pastures. It can be concluded that driving transect sampling is an accurate method to study pronghorn densities in the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem, while walking transect sampling estimations need to be adjusted to obtain accurate population sizes. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;accuracy | Antilocapra americana | line transect | population density | pronghorn;2;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The aim of this work was to assess the features of BLS in extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA) patients in comparison to healthy subjects, applying linear and nonlinear analysis techniques. Methods: We investigated the multichannel lung sounds on the posterior chest of 16 females, 8 healthy and 8 EAA patients, when breathing at 1.5 L/s. BLS linear features were obtained from the power spectral density (PSD) while nonlinear features were extracted by the concepts of irregularity and complexity, i.e., spectral, sample and multiscale entropy. Results: The results demonstrated that spectral percentiles of BLS were lower in EAA patients than in healthy subjects but statistical significance (p<0.05) was obtained only for expiration at the left apical and both basal regions. Also, the maximum amplitude of the PSD in patients reached statistical significance (p < 0.05) for the expiratory phase at basal regions. In the case of nonlinear techniques, significant lower values (p < 0.05) were obtained for EAA patients during both respiratory phases at left apical and both basal regions. Conclusion: In conclusion, we found that BLS in chronic EAA patients is characterized by lower spectral percentiles, lower irregularity and lower complexity than in healthy subjects suggesting the feasibility of its clinical usefulness by screening its temporal alteration. © Schattauer 2013.;Base lung sound | Interstitial lung disease | Linear and nonlinear analysis;19;0;;;;undefined;

A solution is food supplementation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of an enriched corn flour soy protein among indigenous women. Method: The study was conducted with a sample of 308 rural Mexican women, conducted in 2010, longitudinal intervention was double-blind and randomized. The experimental group (n = 155) consumed for tifiedmaizemeal (soy protein, iron and vitaminA, folic acid, zinc and niacin). The control group (n = 153) received unfortified flour. The evaluated indicators were: weight, body mass index, and waist circumference and blood hemoglobin levels. The intervention time was four months (intermediate) and six months (final). Statistical analysis was descriptive, bivariate and linear regression models. Results: Changes in hemoglobin levels in the experimental group were 13,1 to 13,3 mg / dL. The improvement of hemoglobine levels was shown by themostmarginalized community (from 12,4 to 12,9mg / dL). In both groups, the weight gain was 900 g. Though BMI of the experimental group (24,2 to 24,9 / kg/m2) with an increase of (0,7 / kg/m2 ) was equal in both groups, the waist circumference in women who consumed fortified flour was equal at the beginning and end of the study (83,0 cm ) but the hip circumference changed (94,3 to 94,9 cm ) in women who consumed enriched flour.

We found that alcohol increased the risk of a medical emergency by 2.17 times (confidence interval: 1.78-2.65), and those without a regular pattern of heavy drinking and those younger showed a greater risk. Acute alcohol is associated not only with injury but also with medical emergencies. More studies are needed on the acute role of alcohol in medical emergencies, preferably with data on the type of medical emergencies. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.;Alcohol use | Case-crossover | Emergency department | Epidemiology | Risk;2;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;R01AA013750;National Institutes of Health

Meat samples were stored for 14 days at 2±1 °C. The samples were divided into two sections: one was analyzed raw and the other was grilled to 72±2 °C prior to analysis. The data were examined using multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis). RESULTS: Tenderness showed a positive relationship with pH (0.55), and brightness presented a high correlation with sarcoplasmic protein solubility (-0.83) and L* (0.85) in raw ovine meat. Variations during storage were observed; for instance, textural parameters had a maximum value on the third day of storage for raw and grilled meat and decreased over the following days. Conversely, days 7 and 14 were distinguished by higher L* and b* values and by a greasy and bloody odor in the raw ovine meat. On day 14, grilled meat was characterized by chewiness on TPA, an intense grilled-meat odor and intense flavor, which had a positive relationship with cytochrome c equivalents (0.89). Likewise, sensory hardness was highly correlated with WBSF in grilled meat (0.89). CONCLUSION: This information may be useful for describing and predicting ovine meat quality for both consumers and processors. Therefore, vacuum-packaged ovine meat can be stored for 14 days without disagreeable color to the consumer, and the raw meat texture is tender. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.";Meat color | Meat peptides | Raw and grilled ovine meat | Sensory analysis;12;0;;;;undefined;

We obtained: personal data, family history, habits, such as smoking, alcohol, caffeine (coffee and soft drink of cola) and physical activity. Participants complete the questionnaire on 19 risk factors for osteoporosis (International Osteoporosis Foundation) one of them with risk. We evaluated: body mass index (BMI), cardiovascular risk and corporal complexion. Bone densitometry was performed in two diagnostic regions: lumbar spine and total hip and participants were classified as normal bone mass density (BMD), low BMD and osteoporosis. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 7% and of low BMD was 34%, predominantly in the lumbar region and in those with menopause. In osteoporotic women, the age was higher (51 years) and 85% menopausal women, also lower values of weight, height, BMI, waist circumference and hip than women with normal bone mass density. The significantly modifiable risk factors were: low weight, smoking and consumption of soft drink of cola with 6,5, 1,2 and 1,4 (odds ratio), respectively (p <0,05). The significantly non-modifiable risk factors were: menopause (surgical), history of fracture and risk. It is concluded that within the modifiable risk factors for the prevention of osteoporosis, those with the greatest impact were low weight, cigarette and soft drink of cola.;Low bone mass density | Osteoporosis | Perimenopausal women | Risk factors;5;0;;;;undefined;

KAs have been described as benign lesions, but also as variants of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Microscopic differentiation between these 2 entities is problematic, and sometimes impossible. Syndecan-1 (CD138) is an adhesion molecule whose expression appears to be inversely correlated with tumor invasiveness. Elevated Ki-67 expression is indicative of a high proliferation index, a feature of malignant tumors. Methods: Syndecan-1 and Ki-67 expression were assessed in 22 KA skin samples and in 17 SCC skin biopsies. Results: Syndecan-1 expression was diminished in the SCC specimens compared with the KA specimens (P=.000). Ki-67 expression was increased in the SCC specimens compared with the KA specimens, with mean values of 9 and 0.08, respectively (P=.000). Limitations: Further studies that compare intermediate risk KAs to typical KAs and SCCs are required to corroborate these findings. Conclusion: The assessment of syndecan-1 and Ki-67 expression in skin biopsies is a helpful tool for differentiating KA and SCC.;;6;0;;;;undefined;

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a population pharmacokinetic model to characterize the inter- and intra-individual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters of RIF in Mexican patients. Methods: Ninety-four patients receiving antituberculosis therapy participated in this prospective study. Plasma concentration-time data were described using a one-compartment model with lag time, absorption and first-order elimination. The potential influence of demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, and the pharmaceutical formulation (A, B, C and D) on the pharmacokinetics parameters, was evaluated by non-linear mixed-effect modelling (nonmem). Seventy-seven additional patients participated in the validation of the model. Results and Discussion: The final population pharmacokinetic model obtained was as follows: apparent clearance CL/F = 8·17 L/h (1·40 as high for males), apparent distribution volume Vd/F = 50·1 L (1·29 as high for males), absorption rate constant KaA= 0·391/h, KaB,C,D= 2·70/h, relative bioavailability FA= 0·468, FB,C,D= 1, lag time in the absorption phase Tlag= 0·264 h. The final model improved the precision on the parameter estimates (CL/F, Vd/F and Ka by 31·9%, 16·7% and 92·9%, respectively). The residual variability was 27·3%. What is new and Conclusion: Gender was associated with changes in CL/F and Vd/F whereas the pharmaceutical formulation was associated with changes in F and altered the Ka. The validation data set showed that the model could be used in clinical practice for Bayesian dose adjustment of RIF in TB patients. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;antituberculosis drug | non-linear mixed-effect modelling | NONMEM | population pharmacokinetics | rifampicin;21;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Moreover, the field of health appears as a sector with many opportunities to improve services through IT and design. Therefore, e-health comes out as one of the elements that should eventually help in the evolution of business models in health systems. In this chapter, the authors present a design method of IT artifacts for e-health adapted from the method proposed by Pahl and Beitz (1995).

Lung cancer is classifi ed into two large histologic subgroups: small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) according to cellular origin, molecular changes, clinical-pathological features, and response to treatments. NSCLC constitutes 80% of the all cases of lung cancer; nevertheless the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumoral etiology still remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by repressing translation or decreasing mRNA stability in numerous biological processes. In cancer, miRNAs have differential spatial and temporal expression, which is related to several clinical, biological, molecular and genomic features of tumors. miRNA expression profi les, polymorphisms and epigenetic modifi cation inNSCLC have been studied, and these studies have improved NSCLC diagnosis and classifi cation, as well as provided prognostic information. In this review, we describe some of the better-characterized miRNAs in NSCLC and how they could improve lung cancer prognosis and therapy.

To estimate the proportion of Mexican households in food insecurity (FI) and their distribution in relation to nutrition and socioeconomic conditions. Materials and methods. We evaluated information from 40 809 households. FI was measured using a harmonized version for Mexico of the Latin American and Caribbean food Security Scale. Households were classified according to the level of food insecurity as follows: Food security, mild, moderate and severe FI. We describe the distribution of FI according to some household socioeconomic variables. Results. Nationally, 28.2% of households had moderate or severe FI. Rural, indigenous ethnicity and household deprivation were risk factors moderate to severe FI (35.4, 42.2 and 45.9%, respectively). Severe FI was also associated with lower children height and weight. Conclusions. Multi-sectorial actions are needed to address the basic needs of households with moderate and severe FI.;Food security | Mexico | Nutrition surveys | Undernutrition;30;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The EEG records neuronal membrane potential oscillations that depend on the morpho-functional characteristics of the membrane and of modifications by postsynaptic excitatory (PSEP) and inhibitory (PSIP) potentials. The quantitative EEG (qEEG) measures the absolute power (AP) of oscillations separated in frequencies, resulting from the interaction among subcortical-cortical-subcortical ensembles. The hypothesis is that neuronal networks function at a given frequency and that their APs are codes that, by becoming synchronized in diverse ensembles, generate behavior. Objective. To establish the spectral power of cortical oscillations under diverse study paradigms and in different populations. In particular, to identify the AP and topographical distribution of four cerebral frequency bands under resting wakefulness and activation, and to integrate results into a database to establish comparison standards. Material and methods. Undergraduate students, average age of 20.6 ± 2.6 years, who participated voluntarily in the study. Recordings were made with a Nicolet EEG. We chose, in the first stage, closed eyes (CE) three samples of 12 s each. In the second stage, we chose pairs of 6 s samples, first with CE and then with OE. For their analysis, we applied the Welch periodogram and we plotted the average AP (AAP) and standard deviation (SD) of delta, theta, alpha, and beta per lead. Differences were compared through non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon and Dunnett T3); setting statistical significance at α = 0.05. Results. Average APs of each frequency band differ significantly in intensity and topographic distribution generating a profile of each rhythm. When opening the eyes, rhythms desynchronized significantly at different intensities in the diverse leads, except for beta in the left fronto-frontal lead. Discussion. Results indicate the existence of cortical ensembles that synchronize at a determined frequency and are modified by visual stimulation, indicating the effects of the subcortico-cortical circuits. The integrated database provides comparison standards to support diagnoses and treatments.";Absolute power | Cortical mapping | Desynchronization of δ, θ, α and β | EEG spectral power | Topographical distribution;4;0;;;;undefined;

However, there are no studies about the possible effects of rotenone on the offspring when they are indirectly exposed through their mothers. In this study rotenone was administered to female rats during pregnancy and nursing, in order to assess its effects on the offspring's dopaminergic neurons as well as on motor coordination at 30 or 60 postnatal days. In order to quantify the neurons that are immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxilase of the substantia nigra six groups of pregnant Wistar rats were injected: intact (control), with rotenone solvent (vehicle), and four groups injected with the following doses of rotenone: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 y 1.0 mg/kg/day. In a parallel experiment, the offspring of other groups of dams treated with rotenone 1 mg/kg/day, or controls were evaluated at the motor coordination test at 30 and 60 postnatal days. Rotenone treated (1 mg/kg) dams showed a lower amount of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This effect was also noticed in the offspring but at all doses of rotenone used, either at 30 or 60 postnatal days. Furthermore, the offspring of rotenone indirectly exposed dams significantly increased the time in which they accomplished the motor coordination test. These data indicate that rotenone is able to damage the dopaminergic neurons of the offspring when exposed through their mothers. This effect in the offspring is noticed with lower rotenone doses than in adult rats. Therefore, those individuals indirectly exposed to rotenone could have less dopaminergic neurons at early stages of life, a fact that increases the risk of developing disorders related to the brains' dopaminergic system.;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder | Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder | Motor coordination | Parkinson's disease | Rotenone | Substantia nigra | Tyrosine hydroxilase;4;0;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

We conducted a qualitative study that included interviews with nine key actors, participant observation at relevant events, and a review of relevant documents specific to the field. The data collected indicate that the sexological field in Mexico participates intensely in processes and discourses in a dynamic that follows global strategies. The article covers several decades and reviews contextual factors involved in the configuration of Mexican sexology. The information presented here allows us to think about the relationship between local and global processes in the sexological field. Characterizing and analyzing this relationship is fundamental to understanding specific mechanisms, which have permitted sexology to legitimate itself as a discourse of truth on sex. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;history of sexology | qualitative studies | Sexology in Mexico;3;0;;;;undefined;

Presence data points for 376 species of birds across the state, obtained from scientific collections, the literature and field work, were used in the analyzes. The potential distribution of species richness, endemism and threatened species showed the highest concentration in the bio-geographical province of Sierra Madre Oriental. Although there are areas in the south of the state that have a large number of species, they have not been sufficiently evaluated in terms of their conservation. The identification of areas of endemism revealed two major groups: 1) the northern region of the eastern slope of the Sierra Madre Oriental, characterized by humid climates; and 2) the areas that correspond to the western slope of the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Mexican Plateau and the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, characterized by dry and temperate climates and medium-low moisture.

Setting: EDs. Participants: A total of 2503 injured patients from EDs were interviewed between 2010 and 2011, with a response rate of 92.6%. Measurements: Number of drinks consumed within 6 hours prior to the injury and in the two control periods. Findings: The RR of injury after drinking alcohol was 4.38 [95% confidence interval (CI):3.29-5.84] using the prior week as the control period, and 5.35 (CI:3.50-8.17) using the prior day as a control period.

From time-frequency spectra, HFRR and instantaneous RF were computed. RFLI-HFRR correlations were strong in separated and combined conditions, with greater regression slope in combined (p<0.001). Three types of TVLI-HFRR relations were found: negative linear, no change and positive linear.

From time-frequency spectra, high-frequency power of RR intervals (HFRR), low-to-high-frequency ratio (LFRR/HF RR), low-frequency of systolic pressure (LFSP), high-frequency of systolic pressure (HFSP), high-frequency of respiration (HFRe) and HFSP-HFRe time-frequency coherence were computed. LFSP-lnHFRR, LFSP-RR and LFSP-LFRR/HFRR correlations were -0.73±0.09, -0.77±0.06, and 0.66±0.13 respectively. During E, HFRR decreased, HFSP increased (p<0.001) and HF Re-HFSP coherence was 0.93±0.05. Global PSDE of the measures was 41±18%. HRV spectral measures show strong correlation with LFSP power, novel evidence that supports its suitability as sympathetic index. The differential effect of E on HFRR and HF SP and high HFSP-HFRe coherence document the mechanical respiratory origin of HFSP.

Catharanthus roseus (L.) is used in some countries to treat diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypoglycemic activity of extracts from the flower, leaf, stem, and root in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic mice. Methods. Roots, leaves, flowers, and stems were separated to obtain organic and aqueous extracts. The blood glucose lowering activity of these extracts was determinate in healthy and alloxan-induced (75 mg/Kg) diabetic mice, after intraperitoneal administration (250 mg/Kg body weight). Blood samples were obtained and blood glucose levels were analyzed employing a glucometer. The data were statistically compared by ANOVA. The most active extract was fractioned. Phytochemical screen and chromatographic studies were also done. Results. The aqueous extracts from C. roseus reduced the blood glucose of both healthy and diabetic mice. The aqueous stem extract (250 mg/Kg) and its alkaloid-free fraction (300 mg/Kg) significantly (P<0.05) reduced blood glucose in diabetic mice by 52.90 and 51.21%. Their hypoglycemic activity was comparable to tolbutamide (58.1%, P<0.05). Conclusions.

To develop a risk index of suicide attempts in the last 12 months among people with suicide ideation. Materials and methods. Cross-sectional study. Data came from the National Addictions Survey 2008. The risk index was made up by age, marital status, religion, occupation, area of the country in which they live, immigrant to the United States, alcohol and drug consumption, depression symptoms, behavioral problems and a history of sexual abuse. Results. We found a monotonic relationship between the increase in risk factors and the existence of a plan and the risk, with an odds ratio over 2.07 up to 152.19. The area under the curve is quite high, with a value of 0.844, very close to 1. Conclusion. The use of this index may help prevent patients from further developing their suicide ideation process and may prevent a suicide attempt of uncertain consequences, including death.;Mexico | Risk | Suicide | Suicide attempt;21;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The results revealed that there were antigenic differences among the isolates assessed. In particular, the estimated correlation between the PAC-4/1993 and PAC-6/2001 (0.50) isolates and between the PAC-4/1993 and PAC-9/2003 isolates (0.56) displayed a moderate positive correlation. In contrast, there was a strong positive correlation between the PAC-6/2001 and PAC-9/2003 isolates (0.73). We also found that in the state of Guanajuato, PAC-4/1993 was the isolate that was most frequently identified; in Jalisco, the isolate was PAC-6/2001; and in Michoacán, the isolate was PAC-9/2003. By contrast, in the Estado de Mexico, all three isolates appeared to circulate with a low seroprevalence. In general, the analysed sera from the four states displayed a porcine rubulavirus serological prevalence ranging from 9% to 23.7%.

It synthesizes specific conceptions of nature, as well as cumulative learning, beliefs and customs that are part of a particular human community or society. Traditional knowledge has been analyzed from different viewpoints, one of which corresponds to the analysis of ethnoclassifications. In this work, a brief analysis of the botanical traditional knowledge among Zapotecs of the municipality of San Agustin Loxicha, Oaxaca was conducted. The purposes of this study were: a) to analyze the traditional ecological knowledge of local plant resources through the folk classification of both landscapes and plants and b) to determine the role that this knowledge has played in plant resource management and conservation. The study was developed in five communities of San Agustín Loxicha. From field trips, plant specimens were collected and showed to local people in order to get the Spanish or Zapotec names; through interviews with local people, we obtained names and identified classification categories of plants, vegetation units, and soil types. We found a logic structure in Zapotec plant names, based on linguistic terms, as well as morphological and ecological caracteristics. We followed the classification principles proposed by Berlin [6] in order to build a hierarchical structure of life forms, names and other characteristics mentioned by people. We recorded 757 plant names. Most of them (67%) have an equivalent Zapotec name and the remaining 33% had mixed names with Zapotec and Spanish terms. Plants were categorized as native plants, plants introduced in pre-Hispanic times, or plants introduced later. All of them are grouped in a hierarchical classification, which include life form, generic, specific, and varietal categories. Monotypic and polytypic names are used to further classify plants. This holistic classification system plays an important role for local people in many aspects: it helps to organize and make sense of the diversity, to understand the interrelation among plants-soil-vegetation and to classify their physical space since they relate plants with a particular vegetation unit and a kind of soil. The locals also make a rational use of these elements, because they know which crops can grow in any vegetation unit, or which places are indicated to recollect plants. These aspects are interconnected and could be fundamental for a rational use and management of plant resources. © 2012 Luna-José and Aguilar; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";Ethnobotany | Ethnoclassification | San Agustín Loxicha | Traditional ecological knowledge | Zapotecs;9;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We describe the Y-chromosome genetic diversity of 197 Native Mexicans from 11 populations and 1,044 individuals from 44 Native American populations after combining with publicly available data. We found extensive heterogeneity among Native Mexican populations and ample segregation of Q-M242* (46%) and Q-M3 (54%) haplogroups within Mexico. The northernmost sampled populations falling outside Mesoamerica (Pima and Tarahumara) showed a clear differentiation with respect to the other populations, which is in agreement with previous results from mtDNA lineages. However, our results point toward a complex genetic makeup of Native Mexicans whose maternal and paternal lineages reveal different narratives of their population history, with sex-biased continental contributions and different admixture proportions. At a continental scale, we found that Arctic populations and the northernmost groups from North America cluster together, but we did not find a clear differentiation within Mesoamerica and the rest of the continent, which coupled with the fact that the majority of individuals from Central and South American samples are restricted to the Q-M3 branch, supports the notion that most Native Americans from Mesoamerica southwards are descendants from a single wave of migration. This observation is compatible with the idea that present day Mexico might have constituted an area of transition in the diversification of paternal lineages during the colonization of the Americas.

Explored here is the relationship of an alcohol-related injury with an individual usual drinking pattern. Design Alcohol-related injury is examined using hierarchical linear models, taking into account individual usual volume of consumption over the past 12 months, as well as aggregate-level detrimental drinking pattern (DDP) and alcohol policy measures. Setting Data analyzed are from emergency departments (EDs) in 19 countries, comprising three collaborative studies on alcohol and injury, all of which used a similar methodology. Participants The sample comprised 14132 injured drinkers across 46 emergency room (ER) studies. Measurements Alcohol-related injury was measured, separately, by any self-reported drinking prior to injury, a blood alcohol concentration (BAC)≥0.08 and self-reported causal attribution of injury to drinking. Findings While individual usual volume strongly predicted an alcohol-related injury for all three measures, usual drinking pattern also predicted an alcohol-related injury (controlling for volume), with episodic heavy and frequent heavy drinking both more predictive of alcohol-related injury than other drinking patterns. When individual usual volume and drinking pattern were controlled, DDP was no longer a significant predictor of alcohol-related injury. Alcohol policy measures were predictive of both BAC and causal attribution (the stronger the policy the lower the rates of alcohol-related injury). Conclusions Volume of alcohol typically consumed and occurrence of heavy drinking episodes are associated independently with incidence of alcohol-related injury. The stronger the anti-alcohol policies in a country, the lower the rates of alcohol-related injury. © 2012 Society for the Study of Addiction.;Alcohol | BAC | Causal attribution | ED | Injury | Policy;45;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;R01AA013750;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

RIPs are mainly produced by different plant species, but are additionally found in a number of bacteria, fungi, algae and some mammalian tissues. This review describes the occurrence of RIPs, with special emphasis on bacterial RIPs, including the Shiga toxin and RIP in Streptomyces coelicolor recently identified in S. coelicolor.

The aim of this study was to get insights about the cardiovascular regulation of CH children by analysing their heart rate variability (HRV) data.RR-interval data of 34 early treated CH children, 24 to 48months of age, were collected at rest in a clinical environment. In all these cases, CH resulted from an abnormal development of thyroid gland. Data from 29 age matched-controls were also collected in a scholar environment. Short time series were then analysed in time and frequency domains. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) was also applied to obtain the scaling exponent α 1.We found that the HRV obtained from children with CH is diminished as suggested by statistical differences (p<0.05) in the following parameters: RMSDD, pNN20, total power, LF and HF. However, no significant differences were found in the LF/HF ratio, the central frequencies of the LF and HF bands, as well as in α 1.Given that the significant differences were basically reflected in static parameters rather than in the frequency distribution or scale-invariant behaviour of the studied data, we consider that the analysis points toward the effect of treatment on rising heart rate by the thyroid hormone, and not necessarily toward any residual autonomic dysfunction, as the dominant underlying cause of the diminished HRV exhibited by CH children. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..;Congenital hypothyroidism | Heart rate variability | Scaling exponent | Time and frequency parameters;2;0;;;CONACYT;83999;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The experimental series were run at room temperature, 800 rpm and initial pH 4.5. Laccase activity was determined in each of the extracts. The discoloration percentage was determined by UV-Visible spectrophotometry. Assays were performed by triplicate. The use of extracellular enzymes such as laccase, lignin and manganese peroxidase led to the total discoloration of 50mg·l-1 of DB2, after 88h; while the use of active mycelial biomass, allowed reaching a total discoloration after 3h for an initial DB2concentration of 100mg·-1. It was found that DB2 removal efficiency with mycelia is comparable or higher than the one reported with immobilized Phanerochaete chrysosporium.";;4;0;;;;undefined;

A central compound design was chosen to study the combined effect of glycerol used as plasticizer to prepare the TPS (24-40.08%), of NR (9-25.08%) and of clay (2-7.36%). It was found that the combined effect of glycerol and natural rubber is the determining factor in the formation of intercalated structures, mainly by the rubber molecules. The presence of these structures allowed to obtain nanocompounds of TPS/NR/MMT with a resistance to tension up to eight times that of TPS and with considerably higher elongation capacity, of up to 230%, when using rubber concentrations >10% and glycerol contents <30% or >40%. This effect can be explained as the result of the formation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions among the components of natural rubber and glycerol.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

About 20, first lactation cows were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: Tl = control, T2 = selenium and vitamin E. Identical management and diets were fed in both treatments. Performance responses to Selenium (Se) and vitamin E supplementation increases (p<0.05) daily Milk Production (MP) Tl = 8.63 vs. T2 = 9.34, percentage of Crude Protein (CP), Solids Non Fat (SNF) and lactose. Percentage of Milk Fat (MF) and content of Total Solids (TS) was not affected by treatment (p>0.05). Decreased number (p<0.05) of Somatic Cells Count (SCC) was attributable to dietary Se and vitamin E supplementation (2.053 vs. 1.509). Body Condition Score (BCS) in both treatments was similar between treatments (2.5-3.0). Researchers conclude that the incorporation of Se and vitamin E in commercial diets of grazing first lactation cows increases MP and percentage of CP, SNF and lactose content and decreases SCC while BCS of animals were unaffected by treatment. This data confirm earlier findings that Se and vitamin E supplementation are related to mammary health gland. The performance and economic feasibility of the use of selenium plus Vit. E allowed us to obtain a profit margin of $0.21 (US cents) per animal per day in this study. © Medwell Journals, 2012.;Body condition | Dairy cattle | Milk | Production and quality | Selenium-vitamin E | Somatic cell;12;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Data analyzed here pertain to those who reported consuming at least one drink during the last twelve months (n=529). A factor analysis of multiple correspondences and a hierarchic classification were performed. For the factor analysis, usual quantity and frequency of drinking (for the last 12 months) were considered active variables; number of DSM-IV dependence criteria met, positive or negative diagnostic status for abuse, positive or negative diagnostic status for dependence (both for the last 12 months), and socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender and economic level) were considered illustrative variables.Results: The first five factorial axes were retained, accounting for 88% of the total variance. Hierarchic classification resulted in six distinctive classes of drinking patterns. Two patterns were associated with a positive diagnosis of abuse and dependence, respectively. One, drinking between 4 and 6 drinks per occasion mostly on a weekly basis, was associated with a diagnosis of abuse; this pattern was also associated with meeting one or two dependence criteria (dependence orphans). The other, drinking 7 or more drinks per occasion, was associated with a diagnosis of dependence, and also with a diagnostic orphan condition. This class, composed primarily of males, was not characterized by any particular frequency of drinking. The other four drinking patterns were not associated with a positive diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder. Two of them were characterized by drinking low quantities with a low frequency (either monthly or yearly). Participants in both of these classes tended to be female. The other two patterns were characterized by drinking less than 3 drinks per occasion, either daily or weekly: the former associated with being older than 35 years, and the later with no distinctive socio-demographic characteristics.Conclusions: Results demonstrated six distinct drinking patterns, two of them related to a positive diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder. Our findings support previous research indicating that dependence orphans share some characteristics with abuse and dependence cases. Given the lack of similar studies in the region, these findings, although descriptive, enrich the knowledge of alcohol use disorders in the regional context. Furthermore, they may contribute to the development of local drinking guidelines and prevention strategies. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.";Alcohol | Argentina | Drinking patterns | DSM | Use disorders;1;0;;;;undefined;

The Symposium covered different topics on pharmacogenetics and its clinical implications, focusing on Latin-American populations. The activities of the ESPT were also presented and discussed. The topics addressed were regulatory aspects, the use of pharmacogenetics in pre-clinical research, herbal medicine, and natural products, ending with a discussion about translation into clinical practice, specifically for cardiovascular disorders and psychiatry. Finally, the implication for population diversity in Latin America was also discussed. The RIBEF initiative represents a promising step towards the inclusion of Latin American populations among those to benefit from the implementation of pharmacogenetics in clinical practice. Among current RIBEF activities, the CEIBA.FP Consortium aims to study the variability of pheno-and genotypes in Hispanics that are relevant to pharmacogenetics. For this purpose, populations from Mexico, Cuba, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia, Brasil, Perú, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Portugal, and Spain are currently being studied. The meeting's main conclusion was that population pharmacogenetic studies as well as academic clinical trials might need to be conducted in the different geographic locations/countries. This is important in order to improve drug safety, dosage recommendations, and pharmacovigilance programs, because environmental and ethnic factors vary across locations. © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.";cytochrome P450 | Hispanics | Latin America | pharmacogenetics;15;0;;;ISCIII;CP06/0030;Instituto de Salud Carlos III

Cucurbita ficifolia Bouché (C. ficifolia) is an edible Mexican plant whose hypoglycemic activity has been demonstrated in several experimental and clinical conditions. Recently, D-chiro-inositol has been proposed as the compound responsible for the hypoglycemic effects; however, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of this plant has not yet been explored. The aim of this research is to study the influence of a hypoglycemic, D-chiro-inositol-containing fraction from the C. ficifolia fruit (AP-Fraction) on biomarkers of oxidative stress, as well as on the inflammatory cytokines in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The AP-Fraction obtained from the mature fruit of C. ficifolia contained 3.31 mg of D-chiro-inositol/g of AP-Fraction. The AP-Fraction was administrated daily by gavage to normal mice for 15 days as a preventive treatment. Then these animals were given streptozotocin, and the treatments were continued for an additional 33 days. Pioglitazone was used as a hypoglycemic drug for comparison. Administration of the AP-Fraction significantly increased glutathione (GSH) and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver without significantly affecting the levels in other tissues. The AP-Fraction reduced TNF-α and increased IL-6 and IFN-γ in serum. Interestingly, the AP-Fraction also increased IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. These results suggest that C. ficifolia might be used as an alternative medication for the control of diabetes mellitus and that it has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in addition to its hypoglycemic activity. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company & Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.";Anti-Inflammatory Plants | Antioxidant Plants | Cucurbita ficifolia | Cucurbitaceae | Diabetes Mellitus | Hypoglycemic Plants | Inflammatory Cytokines;22;0;;;IFS;undefined;International Foundation for Science

I. sonorae extract blocked the KATP channels in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.05), whereas C. ficifolia extract had no effect on these channels. I. sonorae extract produces a hypoglycemic effect through a similar mechanism to sulphonylureas in this experimental model; however, hypoglycemic action of C. ficifolia extract should be explained by an independent KATP channels mechanism. © 2012 Boletín Latinoamericano y del Caribe de Plantas Medicinales y Aromáticas.";Cucurbita ficifolia | Cucurbitaceae | Diabetes mellitus | Hypoglycemic plants | Ibervillea sonorae | Vascular smooth muscle;7;0;;;;undefined;

At Veracruz State, there are about 687 bird species, and 21.7% of them live in Veracruz wetlands. The bird inventories and ecologic indices are useful to evaluate the perturbation conditions, health and/or environmental deterioration of a site. In this study, the environmental quality of the Santa Alejandrina wetland, in Veracruz, Mexico, was determined through a comparative analysis of the bird community present in different zones with a contamination level gradient. Significantly higher values (p<0.05) of richness and biodiversity were found in the reference or control areas compared with contaminated areas. The hydrocarbon content in soil as well as the community ecological analysis was consistent in three sampling campaigns. Soil of reference areas had very low concentrations of both total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Zone 3 had the highest concentrations of TPH while PAH were the highest in zone 2 (p<0.05). The statistical correlation between biodiversity and TPH concentration was high (r= 0.88, p<0.05). The reference zone was identifed and confrmed, as the one with the best environmental quality, which allows the support of a higher number of species of different families than in the rest of the zones. It is concluded that bird's inventory and ecological indices were useful to evaluate the environmental degradation of the wetland.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

The discovery of the expression of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in adipocytes, suggests an important role in innate immunity. In different models of obesity, there has been observed an increase of TLRs expression in the fat tissue, therefore TLRs could be involved in systemic inflammation in this disease, and in the development of insulin resistance. TLR activation is mediated by fatty acids and their expression is regulated by leptin, adiponectin and PPARs.

Method: Data are reported from emergency department studies in 14 countries on the prevalence of patients' self-report of drinking within the 6 hours before the violence-related injury event, patients' belief that the event would not have happened if they had not been drinking at the time, and patients' perception that the perpetrator had been drinking. Alcohol-attributable fraction was calculated based on the patients' perception that their own drinking was causally related to the event and on their perception that the perpetrator had been drinking. Results: Across all countries, 62.9% of the violence-related injuries involved alcohol use on the part of the victim, the perpetrator, or both. Rates of others definitely drinking, as perceived by the victim, ranged from 14% to 73% across countries and was positively associated with patients' own drinking in the event and with attributing a causal association between their drinking and the event. Estimates of alcohol-attributable fraction were 38.8% when the victim and perpetrator were considered together compared with 23.9% when only the patient was considered and varied by country-level drinking pattern. Conclusions: These findings suggest adjustments that could be made to global burden of disease estimates because of violence-related injury morbidity to better reflect alcohol-attributable fraction when drinking by others and country-level drinking patterns are taken into account.

Data of each studied case were classified into two distinct groups. One group involving segments where the uterine activity was observable (three or more contractions in ten minutes), and the other group of reference having segments with fewer uterine activity or not presenting contractions at all. For comparison, we also included segments collected during the last trimester of gestation prior to labor from a third group of women. Corresponding RR interval series were analyzed to estimate RR mean, RMSSD, 1, 1(MAG) and 1(SIGN) parameters. No significant differences among groups were identified in RMSSD, 1 and 1(MAG) Nevertheless, 1(SIGN) did present significant differences in comparison with the last trimester results (p0.007), revealing a subtle change in the temporal organization of maternal RR series during labor.

These valves are subject to complications such: pannus and/or thrombus formation. One other potential complication is a malfunction in one of the valve leaflets. It is then important to develop parameters that will allow a non-invasive diagnosis of such valve malfunction. In the present study, we evaluated under steady low flow (1-8 L/min) and pulsatile flow (3, 5 and 7 L/min) a bileafleat mechanical heart valve with normal function, 50% and 100% of one valve leaflet malfunction. Image analysis was performed using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate transvalvular pressure gradients (TPG), effective orifice area and a new index given by central/lateral velocity ratio downstream of the valve. Our results showed that the flow upstream and downstream of the defective valve is highly influenced by malfunction severity. TPG did not allow differentiating valve malfunction at low flow under steady and pulsatile conditions. However the new index given by central/lateral ratio allowed differentiating the presence of valve malfunction using a single transverse velocity measurement. © 2011 IEEE.;;3;0;;;;undefined;

The medical aside problem is to measure the integrity and functionality of the lung tissue, specifically at cellular preservation level in order to improve the survival time until it is grafted. The Impedance monitoring technique for diagnosis edema development is the key in this new technique. The hypothesis was that lung edema formation is highly correlated with the reactance changes so that a rat lung perfusion model was considered as a good model to produce edema in vitro. To prove that pulmonary edema can be induced increasing the venous pressure and the perfusion time, the reactance and hemodynamic parameters were recorder in 16 pulmonary blocks of Wistar rats as methodology. Results showed statistical changes in each pulmonary block weight as a consequence to apply 7.51.2 and 10.21.7 mmHg venous pressure (multiple samples, Anova, p0.05). These edema weights were correlated with the reactance changes giving 0.6 (p0.05, Pearson). Also, data analysis showed significant differences in reactance with the time of perfusion at 16, 30, and 50 min when venous pressure level were intermittent switched from 7.5 to 10.2 mmHg. The conclusion was this preliminary evidence sustains that reactance measurement is a good technique for monitoring the lung edema level in rats. However, more research should be continuing in bigger animal models in order to prove the validity and application of this monitoring technique in human lungs. © 2011 IEEE.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Most studies have focused on TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 participation in UC. However, few studies have explored other TLRs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the mRNA profiles of TLR1 to 9 in colonic mucosa of UC patients, according to disease activity.Methods: Colonic biopsies were taken from colon during colonoscopy in 51 patients with Ulcerative Colitis and 36 healthy controls. mRNA levels of TLR1 to 9, Tollip, inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNF were assessed by RT-qPCR with hydrolysis probes. Characterization of TLR9 protein expression was performed by Immunohistochemistry.Results: Toll-like receptors TLR8, TLR9, and IL6 mRNA levels were significantly higher in the colonic mucosa from UC patients (both quiescent and active) as compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.04). In the UC patients group the TLR2, TLR4, TLR8 and TLR9 mRNA levels were found to be significantly lower in patients with quiescent disease, as compared to those with active disease (p < 0.05), whereas TLR5 showed a trend (p = 0.06). IL6 and TNF mRNA levels were significantly higher in the presence of active disease and help to discriminate between quiescent and active disease (p < 0.05). Also, IL6 and TNF mRNA positively correlate with TLRs mRNA with the exception for TLR3, with stronger correlations for TLR5, TLR8, and TLR9 (p < 0.0001). TLR9 protein expression was mainly in the lamina propria infiltrate.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that TLR2, TLR4, TLR8, and TLR9 expression increases in active UC patients, and that the mRNA levels positively correlate with the severity of intestinal inflammation as well as with inflammatory cytokines. © 2011 Sánchez-Muñoz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";;55;1;repositoryvor;Green;;12905;

From the power spectra of RRi and SP series, estimated by TFD, the high frequency power (HFRR), low to high frequency ratio and low frequency power of SP (LFSP) were computed. During both maneuvers the instantaneous dynamics of their spectral indexes were similar, being the changes 50% smaller in MM (p<0.001). In phase II of both maneuvers the SP-HFRR, RRi-HFRR and LFSP-SP relations showed strong correlations that support the baroreflex participation in the two maneuvers, provide a better estimate of the vagal baroreflex sensitivity, and establish the contribution of vasomotor sympathetic outflow to the SP overshoot. © 2011 CCAL.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Material and Methods: An interview guide and a questionnaire were carried out and were applied to quality managers in nine states as well as in Mexico Citýs Health Services, in a Reference Federal Hospital and in a National Institute of Health. These instruments were analyzed using SPSS and Atlas.ti software. Results: The activities done by the managers depend on the organizational level of services, which can be a care unit or the health jurisdiction. For each of these, we identified different order constraints that affect the performance of the role of management in the strategies to improve the quality of the services for population without social insurance, which together make up the government program called Integrated Quality Health System. Jurisdictional managers are the link between care units and state authorities in the management of information, while the medical units' managers drive operational strategies to improve the quality. Conclusion: Although the health program is implemented with the personal and infrastructure of the health system, it requires a greater institutionalization and strengthening of its structure and integration, as well as greater human and material resources.;Health management | Primary health care | Quality assurance;4;0;;;;undefined;

Presently, and derived from the paucity of clinical controlled trials approaching the issue, the management of GCA and TA is largely based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs are used when clear evidence of inflammatory activity is observed. The traditional management approach is to start with systemic glucocorticoid therapy at immunosuppressive dose, followed by cytotoxic immunosuppressive drugs (methotrexate, azatioprine, cyclophosphamide or mycofenolate mofetil) aimed at maintaining remission and decreasing corticosteroid therapy time. Recently, based on the potential pathogenic role of tumor necrosis factor α in these diseases, a series of reports addressing the benefic effect of αTNF-blockers in patients who have been resistant to the traditional management approach have been published. Non- reversible vascular lesions (such as occlusion or stenosis) may require surgical treatment (stent or bypass), however this must be done only when a complete control of the inflammatory activity has been reached. © 2011.;Giant cell arteritis | Takayasu's arteritis | Temporal arteritis | Treatment;5;0;;;;undefined;

Study design: Collaborative retrospective study based on the records of 4 oral pathology diagnostic services in Latin America based on the current World Health Organization classification. Results: There were 7 male and 7 female patients (mean age 31.8 years). Eight tumors occurred in the maxilla and 6 in the mandible. Thirteen cases were epithelium-rich and 1 epithelium-poor COF. Three were classified as hybrid COF with giant cell lesion. Mean size of the hybrid lesions were larger than pure COF (3.8 vs. 2.4 cm). Odontogenic epithelial islands were immunoreactive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, CK5, CK14, CK19, and 34BE12 and negative for CK1 and CK18. Langerhans cells positive for S-100 and CD1a were found within the epithelial islands in 6/6 tested cases. CD68 was expressed in the giant cells of the hybrid lesions and in a few mononuclear cells of 2 cases of COF. Ki-67 index was <1% in all cases. In 6 tumors (42.8%), there were small globular eosinophilic droplets within the epithelial islands, which were positive for collagen type IV, and 9/13 cases (69.2%) were focally positive for smooth muscle actin. In addition to fibroblasts, myofibroblastic differentiation was found in the 2 cases studied ultrastructurally. Conclusions: Immunohistochemistry was useful to confirm the presence of epithelium and to exclude other central fibrous tumors. COF also contains a variable number of mast cells, Langerhans cells, and myofibroblasts, and further studies are needed to better understand the participation of these cells in COF histogenesis. © 2011 Mosby, Inc.;;47;0;;;CONACYT;0090157;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Two hundred samples of canine faeces were analyzed using the Stoll method. A questionnaire was applied to their owners to obtain epidemiological data. The statistical analysis was carried out using chi-square to determine the relationship between the infection and selected variables, taking P = 0.10 as the significant value. The prevalence of geohelminths was 20% (40/200). T. canis 14% and A. caninum 7.5%. All the infections were slight. When the presence of the infection was correlated with the other variables, the following results were obtained: type of dwelling (P = 0.016), presence or not of a garden (P = 0.019), sleeping place of the animal (P = 0.071), frequency of veterinary attention (P = 0.08) and frequency of deparasitation (P = 0.067). One in five dogs showed slight T. canis and A. caninum infections. The results concluded that close contact with infected pet dogs represents a risk for their owners of acquiring visceral or ocular larva migrans or creeping eruption of the skin, as some of these infections can be acquired inside the home.;Ancylostoma | Dogs | Epidemiology | Geohelminths | Toxocara;4;0;;;;undefined;

In this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic early Pb exposure (CePbe) on the morphology, cellular density and relative optical density (OD) in the cells of the SCN of male rats. Female Wistar rats were exposed during gestation and lactation to a Pb solution containing 320ppm of Pb acetate through drinking water. After weaning, the pups were maintained with the same drinking water until sacrificed at 90days of age. Pb levels in the blood, hypothalamus, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were significantly increased in the experimental group. Chronic early Pb exposure induced a significant increase in the minor and major axes and somatic area of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and vasopressin (VP)-immunoreactive neurons. The density of VIP-, VP- and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive cells showed a significant decrease in the experimental group. OD analysis showed a significant increase in VIP neurons of the experimental group. The results showed that CePbe induced alterations in the cells of the SCN, as evidenced by modifications in soma morphology, cellular density and OD in circadian pacemaker cells. These findings provide a morphological and cellular basis for deficits in circadian rhythms documented in Pb-exposed animals. © 2011 The Authors.

Objective: To compare the local control in CPNM with superficial brachytherapy (BQT) of high dose rate (HDR) with Leipzig or mold. Methods: Retrospective research in 70 patients with CPNM in head and neck area, treated only with BQT, superficial HDR, in the BQT Department of the Radiotherapy Service in Hospital General de Mexico from April 1st 2005 to December 31st, 2009. Patients were divided into 5 non-homogenous groups (nose, eye, face, hand and ear). On one group, three of the patients had more than two injuries, so two mold and Leipzig applicators were used to treat them; the patients were analyzed on a separate group. In all the cases the prescribed dose was 5064 cGy in 12 fractions, 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) for 4 weeks. In the applicator's choice the type of surface was essential. In homogenous surfaces Leipzig applicators were used while in the inhomogeneous surface the mold applicator was chosen to guarantee the dose prescription. Results: It was found that in the 5 groups the local control is similar with the 2 types of applicators, except for the external ear canal in which the local failure is presented in up to 20%. Conclusion: In CPNM head and neck area local control is up to 95% with the superficial brachytherapy (BQT) use of high doses rate (HDR). The surface type must be taken into account in the applicators choice (Leipzig or mould).

All these elementary neuromotor patterns are characterized by a high degree of organization, persistence, and stereotypy. In many regards, these patterns are predecessors or precursors of from them the specific human motor patterns which appear spontaneously later as crawling, creeping, sitting, and walking with erect posture. On the basis of our experiences it can be stated that the elementary neuromotor patterns can be activated in all neonates and young infants as congenital motor functions. With regards to their main properties and functional forms, the normal patterns can be divided into two main groups: (1) One group is characterized by lifting of the head and complex chains of movements which are directed to the verticalization of the body; (2) The other group is characterized by complex movements directed to locomotion and change of body position. The neuromotor patterns can be activated by placing the human infant in specific body positions that trigger the vestibulospinal and the reticulospinal systems, the archicerebellum and the basal gangliae. Most of these systems display early myelinisation and are functioning very soon. Many of the elementary neuromotor patterns reflect the most important - spontaneously developing - forms of human movements such as sitting upright in space and head elevation crawling and walking. The majority of the human neuromotor patterns are human specific. When the infant is put in an activating position, crawling, sitting up, and walking begin and last as long as the activating position is maintained. Each elementary neuromotor pattern is a repeated, continuous train of complex movements in response to a special activating position. The brainstem is not sufficient to organize these complex movements, the integrity of the basal ganglia is also necessary. Elementary sensorimotor patterns during human ontogenesis reflect phylogenetic develpoment of species specific human functions. During ontogenesis spontaneous motor development gradually arises from these early specific sensorimotor predecessors.. The regular use of the elementary neuromotor patterns for diagnostic puposes has several distinct advantages. The neuromotor patterns have a natural stereotypy in normal infants and, therefore, deflections from this regular pattern may be detected easily, thus, the activation of the elementary neuromotor pattern is a more suitable method tor identifying defects in the motor activity of the neonate or young infant than the assessment of the primitive reflexes. The ""stiumulus positions,"" which activate specific movements according to how the human neonate or young infant is positioned, do not activate such motor patterns in neonate or young primates including apes. The characteristic locomotor pattern in these adult primates, including the apes, is swinging and involves brachiation with an extreme prehensility. This species specific motor activity is reflected in the orangutan and gibbon neonates by an early extensive grasp. However, according to our investigations, no crawling, creeping, elementary walk, or sitting up can be activated in them. Neonates grasp the hair of the mother, a vital function for the survival of the young. In contemporary nonhuman primates including apes, the neonate brain is more mature. Thus, pronounced differences can be observed between early motor ontogenesis in the human and all other primates. The earliest human movements are complex performances rather than simple reflexes. The distinction between primitive reflexes and elementary neuromotor patterns is essential. Primitive reflexes are controlled by the brainstem. All can be activated in primates. These reflexes have short durations and contrary to elementary sensorimotor patterns occur only once in response to one stimulus, e.g., one head drop elicits one abduction-adduction of the upper extremities correlated to adduction and flexion of the lower extremities to a lesser degree with the Moro reflex. Elementary neuromotor patterns are much more complex and most of them including elementary walk may be elicited as early as the 19th-20th gestational week, though less perfectly than later.";Developmental neurology | Elementary sensorimotor patterns | Phylo- and ontogenesis | Vestibular system;0;0;;;;undefined;

Aims: To examine the receipt of mental health treatment and barriers to care among suicidal people around the world. Method: Twenty-one nationally representative samples worldwide (n=55 302; age 18 years and over) from the World Health Organization's World Mental Health Surveys were interviewed regarding past-year suicidal behaviour and past-year healthcare use. Suicidal respondents who had not used services in the past year were asked why they had not sought care. Results: Two-fifths of the suicidal respondents had received treatment (from 17% in low-income countries to 56% in high-income countries), mostly from a general medical practitioner (22%), psychiatrist (15%) or non-psychiatrist (15%). Those who had actually attempted suicide were more likely to receive care. Low perceived need was the most important reason for not seeking help (58%), followed by attitudinal barriers such as the wish to handle the problem alone (40%) and structural barriers such as financial concerns (15%). Only 7% of respondents endorsed stigma as a reason for not seeking treatment. Conclusions: Most people with suicide ideation, plans and attempts receive no treatment. This is a consistent and pervasive finding, especially in low-income countries. Improving the receipt of treatment worldwide will have to take into account culture-specific factors that may influence the process of help-seeking.";;229;1;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

Methods. 17,944 people aged 65 years and over were assessed in one-phase population-based cross-sectional surveys in geographically-defined catchment areas in nine countries - urban and rural sites in China, India, Mexico and Peru, urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and a rural site in Nigeria. The main outcome was use of community health care services in the past 3 months. Independent associations were estimated with indicators of need (dementia, depression, physical impairments), predisposing factors (age, sex, and education), and enabling factors (household assets, pension receipt and health insurance) using Poisson regression to generate prevalence ratios and fixed effects meta-analysis to combine them. Results: The proportion using healthcare services varied from 6% to 82% among sites. Number of physical impairments (pooled prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.26-1.49) and ICD-10 depressive episode (pooled PR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.38) were associated with service use, but dementia was inversely associated (pooled PR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90-0.97). Other correlates were female sex, higher education, more household assets, receiving a pension, and health insurance. Standardisation for age, sex, physical impairments, depression and dementia did not explain variation in service use. There was a strong borderline significant ecological correlation between the proportion of consultations requiring out-of-pocket costs and the prevalence of health service use (r = -0.50, p = 0.09). Conclusions: While there was little evidence of ageism, inequity was apparent in the independent enabling effects of education and health insurance cover, the latter particularly in sites where out-of-pocket expenses were common, and private health insurance an important component of healthcare financing. Variation in service use among sites was most plausibly accounted for by stark differences in the extent of out-of-pocket expenses, and the ability of older people and their families to afford them. Health systems that finance medical services through out-of-pocket payments risk excluding the poorest older people, those without a secure regular income, and the uninsured. © 2011 Albanese et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";;68;1;repositoryvor;Green;AA;IIRG - 04 - 1286;Alzheimer's Association

These indexes should be complemented with emotional and social aspects related to the individual experience and perception of oral health status. In order to obtain this information, valid instruments capable of evaluating the impact of oral health as it relates to the quality of life (OHRQoL) are required. The objective of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ8-10) is to assess OHRQoL in children aged eight to ten years. CPQ8-10 consists of 25 questions divided into four domains: oral symptoms, functional limitation, emotional well-being, and social well-being. Objective: The aim of this study was to validate the translated Spanish version of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ8-10ESP) in use with Mexican urban children. Material and Methods: Three hundred fifteen students in Mexico City aged eight- to ten-years-old participated in this study. The CPQ8-10ESP questionnaire was self-administered in the classroom. Clinical data about caries and malocclusion were obtained. To assess test-retest reliability, the questionnaire was reapplied to a subgroup of children. Results: Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was 0.89 for the total CPQ8-10ESP scale. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.67; a statistically significant difference was found in the CPQ8-10ESP mean score between children with caries and malocclusion; a significant correlation between general well-being ratings with all domains was found (p<0.001). General perception of oral health was associated with both oral symptoms (p=0.049) and emotional well-being (p=0.022) domains, as well as with the total scale (p=0.015). Conclusions: The CPQ8-10ESP version showed good validity and reliability for use with Mexican schoolchildren.

For this reason we were interested in determining the role of α-Tocopherol using experimental cryptorchidism, followed by orchidopexia in neonatal rats. Eighty-four, 10-day-postpartum (dpp) male rats (Wistar strain) were used and divided into 7 groups: healthy control, sham with α-Tocopherol treated with 30 or 100mg/kg doses, sham vehicle, cryptorchidism treated with α-Tocopherol at 30 or 100mg/kg doses and cryptorchidism vehicle. Cryptorchidism was surgically induced at 10 dpp. At 25 dpp the animals were treated with α-Tocopherol and the vitamin vehicle. Lipoperoxidation and testicular morphology was determined in half of the animals at 40 dpp (short term). The remaining animals underwent orchidopexia and fertility was determined at 90 dpp. Testicular morphology was determined at 120 dpp (long term) in these animals. A significant reduction of lipoperoxidation was observed in the cryptorchid group treated with α-Tocopherol compared to the untreated cryptorchid group, in addition to short-term histological alterations. At long term, we observed an increase in the area and maturation of the seminiferous epithelium, a decrease in apoptosis and histological alterations and an increase in fertility from α-Tocopherol treatment. α-Tocopherol treatment decreased lipoperoxidation, possibly stabilizing free radicals produced during cryptorchidism, reducing morphological testicular alterations and favoring fertility. © 2011 The Authors.

It analyses the discourses of migrant men in the cities of San Diego and Fresno who identify themselves as heterosexual and have not had sexual experiences with men and those of members of civil society organisations doing HIV prevention work with migrant men, to show how an identity-based model of sexuality used by the HIV prevention organisations is counter to the strategic, non-identity-based model constructed by migrant men. With this incongruence as its starting point, the paper offers a critique both of the epistemological factors underlying the category of 'men who have sex with men' and the logic running through HIV prevention discourses that adhere to the Foucauldian notion of the deployment of sexuality, which demands both truth and coherence in subjects' sexuality. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.;HIV prevention | Homosexuality | Masculinity | Mexico | Migrant;4;0;;;UC Berkeley;undefined;University of California Berkeley

One way to increase the availability of the pollutant in aquifers for remediation ad situ is by surfactant addition. Tween 80 is a nonionic surfactant with low critical micellar capacity and low toxicity to microorganisms, and represents a good candidate for enhanced PCE solubilization. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the addition of Tween 80 on the solubility of PCE in a representative water. The maximum concentration of soluble PCE was 1532mg·l-1 at the highest dose of Tween 80 used in this work (800mg·l-1). In contrast the maximum solubility of PCE in water without addition of surfactant was 120mg·l-1. Results show a high PCE solubilization ratio of 12 with Tween 80, compared to ratios of 1.53 and 2.26 for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and the biosurfactant UH, determined at 800mg·l -1 of each surfactant. High values of other indices, such as K m and the molar solubility ratio, also confirmed the superiority of Tween 80 with respect to SDS and UH, for this application. Tween 80 appears a good candidate for solubilizing high concentrations of PCE in groundwater.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

This study was carried out in fifty seven milk herds belonging to seven towns of State of México, México, where seven hundred twenty two milk samples were obtained as well as thirteen sputum samples from workers in contact with the cattle. All the samples were processed according to the Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique in order to detect acid-alcohol resistant bacilli, resulting positive twenty-five samples of milk and four of sputum. The twenty-five positive samples of milk belong to only teen herds which are distributed among the seven towns included in . the study. The four positive samples of sputum belong to only two herds, one of them from Zacazonapan town and the other from Temasacaltepec one. In the Zacazonapan herd, five milk samples were positive out of twelve obtained (42%), and the two sputum samples collected were also positive. In the Temascaltepec herd, seven milk samples turned out to be positive out of eighteen obtained (39%) and the two sputum samples collected resulted positive too. In both herds, the collected data suggest the presence of this zoonosis.

Ninety six, 10min ECG recordings were collected along gestation (7 to 39weeks). Corresponding RR fluctuations series were analysed to obtain the RMSSD, α1, α1(mag) and α1(sign) parameters. Four groups covering first, second and last trimesters of gestation were conformed. No significant changes in α1, which was close to unit, and α1(sign) among gestational groups were identified. But, in accordance with previous findings, we did find a significant reduction of RMSSD along gestation, and significant short-term changes that indicate a higher degree of nonlinearity after about 26weeks of gestation (α1(mag)>0.5)). These results suggest that the short-term heart rate dynamics of low risk pregnant women do not become compromised during gestation, despite the increased haemodynamic demands and other ongoing adaptations. Yet the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the cardiac regulation of pregnant women does seem to increase from mid-pregnancy, possibly owing to new short-term control influences or to modifications regardless the strength of the regulatory interactions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.;Autonomic mechanisms | Pregnancy | RR dynamics | Scaling exponent;14;0;;;CONACYT;I0003-83999;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Design: Discrete-time survival models were applied to retrospectively reported age of onset of first suicidal ideation, plan and attempt and age of onset of first substance use and disorder. Participants: 3005 adolescents aged 12-17 residing in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area in 2005. Measurements: The World Mental Health computer-assisted adolescent version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess suicidal outcomes and psychiatric disorders including substance dependence/abuse. Findings: Use of and dependence on tobacco is as strong a predictor of subsequent suicidality as is use of and dependence with abuse of alcohol and drugs. The association between substance use and subsequent suicidality is not fully accounted for by comorbid mental illness. Conclusion: Efforts to reduce the use as well as the abuse of alcohol, drugs and tobacco may help reduce the risk of subsequent suicidal behaviors among adolescents in Mexico. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;Adolescent | Alcohol | Illicit drugs | Mental health | Mexico | Smoking | Suicidality | Suicide | Tobacco;41;0;;;MOE;CONACYT-SEP-SSEDF-2003-CO1-22;Ministry of Education

This review covers the research published within the last 20 years on the experience of people of Hispanic background regarding suicide ideation and attempt when they first come to the US (first generation) looking for improvements in their standard of living through better jobs and more social opportunities, and as immigrants get settled and have US-Born children (second generation) and grand-children (third generation and so on). We also introduce new research regarding suicide ideation and attempt among return migrants and the families that the immigrants leave behind in their homeland. The current research in this area is limited in number and scope of interest, with most studies focusing on the simple ethnicity comparison. The research is basically cross-sectional and has produced results that are inconsistent in several key points. Currently, we do not know if Hispanics have rates of suicide ideation and attempts that are higher (or lower) when compared to Whites in the US. Evidence is more consistent on four other points. First, there is evidence that immigrants of Mexican origin who immigrated while youths (12 years or less) have rates of suicide ideation and attempt that are higher than similar persons who remained in their home country (i.e. Mexican non-migrants). Second, immigrants have crude lower prevalence of suicide ideation and attempt (both lifetime and 12-month) when compared to US-Born Hispanics of the same ethnicity, especially if they immigrated at older ages. Third, there is some evidence that Hispanics with more US-Born parents to have higher crude prevalence of suicide attempt when compared to US-Born Hispanics with no US-Born parents, but this was not always supported in multivariate analyses. Fourth, all studies showed that the preference in the use of English was positively associated with ideation, and suicide attempt, but associations between language use and attempts did not reach statistical significance. Research efforts that combine populations and information from sending and receiving countries and expand the number of groups under comparison to cover as many specific migratory experiences as possible are needed. This effort will require much more complex research designs that will call for true international collaboration. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Materials and methods: A quasi-experimental study with crossover design and simple masking was conducted in 24 randomized subjects to initiate the control or experimental group. Traction and rhythmic oscillation were applied for five minutes to the ankle joint. H wave amplitude changes of Hoffmann reflex (electrical equivalent of the monosynaptic spinal reflex) was assessed, stimulating the tibial nerve at the level of the popliteal fossa and recording in the soleus muscle. In each subject 12 measurements were taken: basal rate, during and after mobilization. Changes in H reflex amplitude were calculated in relation to basal measurement.For each measurement a hypothesis test was performed (Student t test). Results: In groups of patients with brain injury and incomplete spinal cord injury, a significant difference was found between measurements of both studies, concerning variation in H reflex amplitude during the application of joint mobilization techniques, with a decrease in the experimental group and an increase in the control group. In contrast, no significant differences were found after mobilization therapy. Patients with complete spinal cord injury showed no significant differences in any measurements. Conclusion: We demonstrate the effectiveness of joint mobilization in the decrease of H reflex amplitude in patients with brain injury or incomplete spinal cord injury during the mobilization maneuver, but no residual effect after completion of the trial. This research showed no evidence regarding excitability reduction in complete spinal cord injury. We suggest that therapeutic interventions to decrease muscle tone based on the joint mobilization should be reconsidered.;Exercise movement techniques | Muscle spasticity | Muscle tone | Musculoskeletal manipulations;1;0;;;;undefined;

The results were analyzed as a factorial arrangement (5 × 4), with the factors being the estimation method and the vegetal group factors. The estimated K (deer/ha) with total biomass was the highest (1.043), followed by grass (0.707) and herbs (0.325), whereas the estimates with trees and shrubs were the lowest ones (0.228 and 0.032 deer/ha). The K estimated, based in shrubs availability gives the value most similar to the population density than with the other methods, independently of selected method (DM, DE or N availability, pressure of pasture or ecological metabolism).

Under normal physiological conditions, the growth and development of the foetus depends upon nutrients such as glucose, lipids and amino acids. In addition to the maternal and foetal status, genetic factors are also reported to play a role. The main function of the placenta in all species is to promote the selective transport of nutrients and waste products between mother and foetus. This transport is facilitated by the close proximity of the maternal and foetal vascular systems in the placenta. The foetus depends on the placental supply of nutrients, which regulates energy reserves by means of glycogen storage. Also, the synthesis of foetal hepatic glycogen guarantees energy reserves during perinatal asphyxia or maternal hypoglycaemia. However, the foetus can also obtain energy from other resources, such as gluconeogenesis from the intermediary metabolism of the Krebs cycle and most amino acids. Later, when the placental glucose contribution ends during the transition to the postnatal period, the maturation of biological systems and essential metabolic adaptations for survival and growth is required. The maintenance of normoglycaemia depends on the conditions that determine nutrient status throughout life: the adequacy of glycogen stores, the maturation of the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic pathway, and an integrated endocrine response.;Foetal glycogenolysis | Hypoxia | Neonatal gluconeogenesis;60;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Urethras, similar to other long tubularised tissues, can stricture after reconstruction. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of tissue-engineered urethras using patients' own cells in patients who needed urethral reconstruction. Five boys who had urethral defects were included in the study. A tissue biopsy was taken from each patient, and the muscle and epithelial cells were expanded and seeded onto tubularised polyglycolic acid:poly(lactide-co-glycolide acid) scaffolds. Patients then underwent urethral reconstruction with the tissue-engineered tubularised urethras. We took patient history, asked patients to complete questionnaires from the International Continence Society (ICS), and did urine analyses, cystourethroscopy, cystourethrography, and flow measurements at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months after surgery. We did serial endoscopic cup biopsies at 3, 12, and 36 months, each time in a different area of the engineered urethras. Patients had surgery between March 19, 2004, and July 20, 2007. Follow-up was completed by July 31, 2010. Median age was 11 years (range 10-14) at time of surgery and median follow-up was 71 months (range 36-76 months). AE1/AE3, α actin, desmin, and myosin antibodies confirmed the presence of cells of epithelial and muscle lineages on all cultures. The median end maximum urinary flow rate was 27·1 mL/s (range 16-28), and serial radiographic and endoscopic studies showed the maintenance of wide urethral calibres without strictures. Urethral biopsies showed that the engineered grafts had developed a normal appearing architecture by 3 months after implantation. Tubularised urethras can be engineered and remain functional in a clinical setting for up to 6 years. These engineered urethras can be used in patients who need complex urethral reconstruction.

Methods: Three parametrization techniques, the percentile frequencies, the univariate AR modeling, and the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix were evaluated when applied to BS. These sounds were acquired in twelve healthy subjects by a 5 × 5 sensor array on the posterior thoracic surface plus the sound at the tracheal position, to obtain feature vectors that fed a supervised multilayer neural network. Based on BS classification rate, the spatial distribution of each BS class was obtained by constructing an image using deterministic interpolation. Results: The univariate AR modeling was the best parametrization technique producing a classification performance of 96% during the validation phase and just 4% of not classified feature vectors. Corresponding values for the percentile frequencies were 92% and 7.7%, whereas for the eigenvalues were 91% and 9.0%. Conclusion: This work shows that it is possible to generate confident images associated with the distribution of normal BS classes. Therefore, a detailed image about the spatial distribution of BS in humans might be helpful for detecting lung diseases. © Schattauer 2010.;Acoustic imaging | Breath sounds | Sound classification;4;0;;;;undefined;

Zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules were incorporated into the porous network of titanium dioxide (TiO2) using the sol-gel method. It was prepared from stock solutions of ZnPc and TiO2. ZnPc-TiO2 was tested with four cancer cell lines. The characterization of supported ZnPc showed that phthalocyanine is linked by the N-pyrrole to the support and is stable up to 250°C, leading to testing for PDT. The preferential localization in target organelles such as mitochondria or lysosomes could determine the cell death mechanism after PDT. The results suggest that nanoparticulated TiO2 sensitized with ZnPc is an excellent candidate as sensitizer in PDT against cancer and infectious diseases.

Cystic fibrosis, the most common autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by defects in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) that encodes a chloride channel. To date, over 1,800 mutations have been described related to the causative gene of CF, showing a variable frequency among populations. In a previous extensive analysis of the CFTR locus in 97 Mexican patients, 34 different mutations (75% of CF alleles) were found using several strategies for mutation screening; however, 63% had at least an uncharacterized allele. Despite the combined technologies used, there are still a great number of unknown mutations in the Mexican population. Objective. Screening of the CFTR gene to provide additional evidence of the mutational wide spectrum responsible for CF in Mexican patients. Material and Methods. In this study, the number of unrelated CF patients was increased to 230, 133 new cases and the 97 previously reported to include 63% with at least an uncharacterized allele. Additional tools were used to improve the detection rate of CF mutations, such as a commercial kit for 36 mutations plus a single chain conformational polymorphism method and DNA sequencing. Results. By using a combination of these strategies we characterized 77.7% of all the CF alleles, resulting in a total of 46 different mutations detected, including the identification of 12 additional mutations (p.R334W, p.A455E, C.3120+1G > A, C.3272-26A > G, C.711+1G > T, p.Q552X, p.W1282X, c.IVS8-5T, p.R1162X and p.R347P, p.D1152H and p.T1036N). Although these 12 mutations have been reported in other populations, they have not yet been reported in Mexican patients. This report shows that Mexico has one of the widest spectra of CFTR mutations worldwide. The knowledge of the ethnic and geographic distribution of CFTR mutations in this population will allow the development of more effective methods for diagnosis and treatment.";CFTR gene | Cystic fibrosis | Mexican patients | Mutations;13;0;;;;undefined;

The Council certification program is a market-based incentive that recognizes and rewards sustainable fishing. It is currently the most widespread eco-labeling program worldwide, with 69 certified fisheries, including two in Latin America. This region represents an opportunity for the program in its attempt to certify more fisheries in developing countries. Latin American fisheries present specific features for participation in the program, for which post-certification benefits are different. It is found that, at least for Mexican fisheries, this certification does not function as a market incentive. In most cases, costs associated with the certification process are not fully assumed by the fishing companies. However, indirect non-economic benefits are an important incentive. It is proposed that market/political/social reality and lack of sufficient scientific knowledge will prove the key considerations for a more intense participation of Latin American fisheries in the certification initiative.;;14;0;;;;undefined;

However, few studies have assessed which traumas are uniquely predictive of: the first onset of suicidal behavior, the progression from suicide ideation to plans and attempts, or the persistence of each form of suicidal behavior over time. Moreover, few data are available on such associations in developing countries. The current study addresses each of these issues. Methodology/Principal Findings: Data on trauma exposure and subsequent first onset of suicidal behavior were collected via structured interviews conducted in the households of 102,245 (age 18+) respondents from 21 countries participating in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys. Bivariate and multivariate survival models tested the relationship between the type and number of traumatic events and subsequent suicidal behavior. A range of traumatic events are associated with suicidal behavior, with sexual and interpersonal violence consistently showing the strongest effects. There is a dose-response relationship between the number of traumatic events and suicide ideation/attempt; however, there is decay in the strength of the association with more events. Although a range of traumatic events are associated with the onset of suicide ideation, fewer events predict which people with suicide ideation progress to suicide plan and attempt, or the persistence of suicidal behavior over time. Associations generally are consistent across high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides more detailed information than previously available on the relationship between traumatic events and suicidal behavior and indicates that this association is fairly consistent across developed and developing countries. These data reinforce the importance of psychological trauma as a major public health problem, and highlight the significance of screening for the presence and accumulation of traumatic exposures as a risk factor for suicide ideation and attempt.©2010 Stein et al.";;227;1;repositoryvor;Green;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

The associations between physical conditions and suicidal behavior remain unclear due to sparse data and varied methodology. Methods: Predictive associations between 13 temporally prior physical conditions and first onset of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were examined in a 14-country sample (n = 37,915) after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial covariates, with and without adjustment for mental disorders. Results: Most physical conditions were associated with suicidal ideation in the total sample; high blood pressure, heart attack/stroke, arthritis, chronic headache, other chronic pain, and respiratory conditions were associated with attempts in the total sample; epilepsy, cancer, and heart attack/stroke were associated with planned attempts. Epilepsy was the physical condition most strongly associated with the suicidal outcomes. Physical conditions were especially predictive of suicidality if they occurred early in life. As the number of physical conditions increased, the risk of suicidal outcomes also increased, however the added risk conferred was generally smaller with each additional condition. Adjustment for mental disorders made little substantive difference to these results. Physical conditions were equally predictive of suicidality in higher and lower income countries. Conclusions: The presence of physical conditions is a risk factor for suicidal behavior even in the absence of mental disorder. © 2010 by the American Psychosomatic Society.";mental disorders | physical conditions | suicidal behavior;151;0;;;NIH;R01MH069864;National Institutes of Health

Probability samples of patients 18. years and older were drawn from emergency departments in Mar del Plata, Argentina (n=780), Pachuca, Mexico (n=1624) and Santa Clara, U.S. (n=1220). Concurrent validity was assessed by comparing their performance against a diagnosis of alcohol dependence (DSM-IV) obtained through the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, and for the briefer measures, also by their correlation with the AUDIT. The internal consistency of the CAGE, RAPS4, and TWEAK scores was estimated by the KR-20 formula and by Cronbach's Alpha for the AUDIT. Corrected item-total correlation and D-values were used as item discrimination measures.In Argentina and Mexico the AUDIT and the RAPS4 showed the highest validity.

The interaction between the predator Harmonia axirydis Pallas and the aphid Aphis gossypii Glover was studied. Four prey densities (75, 150, 225 and 300) were evaluated the type of functional response and the corresponding parameters were estimated using the Holling model and nonlinear iterative minimal squares regression as mathematical tools. The logistic regression indicates a type II functional response, and the instantaneous rate of search (a) and handling time (Th) had values of 0.0326 and 0.00076h, respectively. The values of the parameters of search efficiency (E), total handling time (Thy) and total search time (Tst) were statistically different between the studied prey densities. The results indicate that H. axirydis shows great potential as an aphid control bioagent of A. gossypii and even at the highest density studied (300 preys) the predator had plenty of time to continue its prey searching, indicating that satiation was not reached.;;8;0;;;;undefined;

Aims: To examine the associations between childhood adversities as risk factors for the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviour across 21 countries worldwide. Method: Respondents from nationally representative samples (n = 55 299) were interviewed regarding childhood adversities that occurred before the age of 18 years and lifetime suicidal behaviour. Results: Childhood adversities were associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt and ideation in both bivariate and multivariate models (odds ratio range 1.2-5.7). The risk increased with the number of adversities experienced, but at a decreasing rate. Sexual and physical abuse were consistently the strongest risk factors for both the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviour, especially during adolescence. Associations remained similar after additional adjustment for respondents' lifetime mental disorder status. Conclusions: Childhood adversities (especially intrusive or aggressive adversities) are powerful predictors of the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviours.;;225;1;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH059575;National Institute of Mental Health

Due to the large absorption coefficient (135 cm-1) at the laser wavelength, penetration length is only ∼74μm inside the liquid and asymmetric bubbles are generated near the beam's entrance wall. We report the temporal dynamic of the cavitation bubble, which is much shorter than previously reported. We found that the amplitude of the shock wave decreases exponentially with the beam power. As shown in this work, thermocavitation is a phenomenon that has a great application potential in areas such as ultrasonic waves generation and controlled tissue ablation for use in lithotripsy. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

In this work, we studied the effects of sub-acute lead administration on the distribution of NOS isoforms in the hippocampus with respect to blood and hippocampal lead levels. Lead acetate (125, 250 and 500. ppm) was given via drinking water to adult male Wistar rats for 14 days. We determined blood and hippocampal lead levels by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Antibodies against three isoforms of NOS were used to analyze expression and immunolocalization using western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Blood and hippocampal lead levels were increased in a dose-dependent manner in groups treated with lead acetate. We found diminished expression and immunoreactivity of nNOS and eNOS at 500. ppm as compared to the control group. No expression and immunoreactivity was observed in hippocampus for iNOS. The observed high levels of lead in the blood reflect free physiological access to this metal to the organism and were related to diminished expression and immunoreactivity for nNOS and eNOS. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.;Hippocampus | Lead | Neurotoxicity | Nitric oxide | Nitric oxide synthase | Rats;19;0;;;;undefined;

Recent findings In Mexico and elsewhere studies have emerged on the risk of suicidal behaviour among those with substance use disorders that are not affected by treatment selection bias or by psychiatric comorbidity. In developed and developing groups of nations, alcohol use disorders were associated with increased odds ratio (OR) of ideation (range 2.0-2.5) and attempt (2.6-3.7), whereas drug use disorders were associated with increased risk of ideation (2.3-3.0) and attempt (2.0-4.0). Follow-up studies of general population samples reported an OR for drug use disorders from 1.9 to 3.7 for ideation, and an OR of 3.0 for attempt. Alcohol dependence increased suicide ideation with an OR of 1.5. Those drinking alcohol prior to the suicide attempt had ORs in the range of 6.2-9.6. This increase may have a dose-response relationship. We found no studies providing risk estimates for drug use prior to a suicide attempt. Summary Current evidence points to a causal role of alcohol and drug use disorders exerting a distal effect on suicidal behaviour. Evidence for the proximal role of alcohol and drug use, as triggers of suicidal behaviour, are still very limited in number, analytical techniques and scope of substances other than alcohol. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health π Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 0951-7367.;Alcohol | Drug use | Mexico | Risk | Substance use disorder | Suicide;105;0;;;;undefined;

The goals of this study were to evaluate by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry the presence of ultra-structural variations in platelets from individuals with recent diagnosis of major depression disease (MDD, patients without previous anti-depressant treatment and from healthy control subjects.). Platelets from depressed patients had a greater proportion of dendritic forms compared with those obtained from control subjects. Morphological changes, such as dilation of open canalicular and dense tubular systems, platelet vacuolization, electrodense pattern of membranes, and a different immunolocalization of P-selectin were observed in the platelets from depressed patients compared with those isolated from healthy subjects. Our results revealed ultra-structural changes in platelets isolated from patients with MDD suggestive of enhanced platelet activation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.;Blood coagulation | Cardiovascular disease | Major depressive disorder | P-selectin | Platelet morphology | Platelets;14;0;;;;undefined;

Thyroid nodules are frequent, but only 5-30% are malignant. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is useful for initial evaluation; nevertheless, malignancy is uncertain when follicular neoplasm is reported. Some factors can be associated with malignancy. Therefore, we analyzed our follicular neoplasms in order to identify those factors associated with a higher risk of malignancy. Methods: We analyzed the clinical files of consecutive patients with cytological diagnoses of follicular neoplasm. Results: From 1,005 cases of thyroid nodules, 121 were follicular neoplasms according to cytology. Of these, 75 were surgically treated. Definitive report showed 45 benign (60%) and 30 malignant (40%) cases. Benign cases included 29 goiters, 11 follicular adenomas, and 5 cases of thyroiditis. Malignant cases were comprised of 12 papillary carcinomas, 4 follicular carcinomas, 3 papillary carcinomas-follicular variant, 1 lymphoma, 1 teratoma, 5 medullary carcinomas, 2 insular carcinomas, 1 anaplastic carcinoma and 1 metastatic breast carcinoma. Tumor size of benign lesions was 3.43 ± 2.04 cm, and 4.67 ± 2.78 (p = 0.049) for malignant lesions. Age was 46.95 ± 15.39 years for benign lesions and 48.67 ± 17.28 for malignant lesions (p = 0.66). Fifty percent of males showed malignancy vs. 37.7% of females (p <0.005). Conclusions: Our results suggest that size and gender, but not age, are associated with cytological pattern. Ultrasonographic characteristics may be useful discriminating patients with a higher risk of malignancy. FNAB is a useful tool for initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, but clinical evaluation can enhance predictive value.";Fine needle aspiration biopsy | Follicular carcinoma | Follicular neoplasm | Thyroid nodule;8;0;;;;undefined;

The HOME uses an observation/interview format to measure specific interactions between the caregiver and the child, various issues and events that might stimulate the child, and a variety of experiences provided at home or by family members that offer opportunity for growth and development. There are several versions to use from birth to age 3 (Infant-Toddler HOME), the most famous data come the late 60's (1968), it is composed by 45 items (HOME-45) clustered into six subscales. It has a back up of 40 years of publications, over 650 papers, associating with the children's language development, intellectual performance, and academic achievement or psychosocial and socioeconomic characteristics of the family. In Mexico, there are only two published version reports of the use of HOME-45. Most reports refer to the version of Cravioto from the late 60's, with 7 subscales and 62 items (HOME-62) from which there's poor information in the literature about the criteria for to interpreter the outcome results. The aim is to show the results of the implementation of both versions of HOME inventory, and provide criteria for interpretation in a sector of the Mexican population of low socioeconomic status. Material and Methods: We studied 1031 children and their homes from three communities of low socioeconomic status of central Mexico. Explaining the procedures and obtained informed consent, they were visited at home to implement the HOME Inventory and the socio-economic survey, with a 95% interobserver reliability. The procedures performed were approved by the Ethics and Research Committees from National Pediatric Institute. We applied the HOME-45 and HOME-62 in a integrated format to obtain the total score and each subscale from each version. It was also felt cut-off formed three groups with low stimulation (lowest fourth), middle stimulation (middle half) and high stimulation (upper fourth). The HOME-45 applies all the items to children 0 to 3 years; in the HOME-62 before 3 months old are evaluated only 50 items and after 3; 9; 12; 15 and 18 months old apply 54; 55; 57; 59 and 62 items respectively. Depending on the age, 26 to 36 items are common, representing from 58 to 80% of HOME-45 and 52 to 58% of HOME-62. There is no correspondence between the subscales of both versions, they have a different name and composition of items; so, we consider both versions as different. Social survey: A modified version of the socio-economic interview of the National Pediatric Institute was applied, therefore three levels were established: medium low, low and very low social-economic status. Statistical analysis: Four groups were formed by age range of children, to analyze the version HOME-45 and 6 groups for HOME-62 version, depending on the number of applicable items indicated in the format. The analysis related to HOME-62 considered only those items that the format indicates to apply for specific ages. Analyze was performed using JMP statistical software (version 5.01; SAS). We used ANOVA, Student's t test or Tukey Kramer's test to examine differences between means and chi square test to assess differences between proportions; p< 0.05 was considered statistical significance. Results: 52.7% of the children were female, aged 1 to 35 months (0=16.2 ± 9.3 months) mother was the primary caregiver of the child at 87.8%. The mean mother's age was 26.5 ± 5.7 years with a range of 14 to 43 years, the father's age was 29.8 ± 7.34 years. Mother's education mean was 9 years, 24% elementary school or less. HOME-45 Inventory achieved mean score in the population of 31.02 ± 5.68 points, equivalent to a hits proportion of 0.69 ± 0.13, with limits between 0.51 (variety) to 0.81 (responsibity). We found statistical significance differences in the total score of HOME-45 Inventory according to socioeconomic and marital status, birth order of children, education and age of parents. There were also found differences between all subscales of HOME-45 with the socioeconomic status and parent's education. With scores of HOME-45 Total difference was found between children younger than 6 months respect to older. There were also differences in the same sense in the subscales except for Acceptance and Organization subscales. It was considered the cutoff point for low, medium and high stimulation in the total population (0-35 months), to total scale and each subscale, the most important differences observed occurred in children under 6 months of age. HOME-62 Inventory (Cravioto): The total score and the subscales of HOME-62 also showed associations with sociodemographic variables such as education, age and marital status from parents, socioeconomic family status and birth order of children. Scores reached at the HOME-62 were equivalent to the hits proportion of 0.74 ± 0.1, all subscales showed mean higher than 0.5 and three above 0.8. There were major differences in the total score of HOME-62 considering the age group proposed, similar differences were observed in most of the subscales. The cut-off points for types of stimulation of total HOME-62 tend to increase with the age of the child. The same happened with the subscales except Frequency and Stability of adult contact and Emotional climate, were descended. It was compared the relationship between the two versions of HOME once the criteria proposed was applied: 719 family environments were similarly characterized by both versions (69.7%) and 235 environments (22.8%) were defined by the HOME-45 with great stimulation while 80 environments (7.8%) were defined by the HOME-62 with great stimulation too. Discussion: There are no benchmarks in the Mexican population for any of the two versions of HOME used. And the international benchmarks HOME-45 were obtained from American families for over 30 years, being important to have results related to its application and interpretation of HOME-45 in a sector of the Mexican population, allowing contrasting findings regarding those obtained in other latitudes. HOME-62 version is the most widely used in Mexico, but little has been reported about the achieved scores, because there are no criteria for interpretation. The values proposed in this paper can be used in future comparisons with the results of other studies. Differences in scores of each version of HOME according to the age of the children, make it necessary to show the results adjusted by age ranges, common procedure in several instruments. The results of HOME-45 in the population were similar to those obtained in other data, there were no statistical differences with the Little Rock values in the total score, and it existed with the subscales of Acceptance and Organization. Like in that population, the tendency to increase the total score of HOME-45 with age was due mainly to Learning materials and Variety subscales. The results of HOME-62 provide benchmarks for its interpretation in 6 age group and all subscales. If they are applied to the results of the Cravioto's investigation, they are able to differentiate families with a history of malnourished children in the early years of life. Both versions showed ability to discriminate socio-economic characteristics of family. It is necessary to report results of the implementation of HOME in different contexts in qualitative and quantitative terms for a proper comparison and interpretation of the differences between groups as well as analyzing the relationship between the specific results in the subscales of both versions with the development, behavior and welfare of children.";Child development | Family environment | HOME inventory | Socioeconomic status;4;0;;;;undefined;

This neoplasm, known as Masson's tumor, is an unusual vascular lesion of proliferating endothelial cells. It is usually confined to the lumen of preexisting vessels or vascular malformations. The principal significance of IPEH is its microscopic resemblance to angiosarcoma and possible misdiagnosis as such. Achieving a correct diagnosis is essential to avoid subjecting a patient to unnecessarily aggressive therapy. For this reason, awareness of this lesion is very important for dermatologists and dentists. In this article, we discuss the clinical features, histopathological characteristics, and management of IPEH and review the pertinent literature. Copyright © 2010 S.

This plant is wild-crafted, and conservationists have expressed concerns with regard to the sustainability of production. In the present work, two factors were found to be of importance for the regeneration of M. dealbata and the production of honokiol and magnolol. These factors were the type of explants and the combination and concentration of plant-growth regulators. Green, compact, nodular organogenic callus was obtained from leaf explants in a medium fortified with Murashige and Skoog salts and supplemented with 1.5 mg/L 2,4-dicholorophenoxyacetic acid and 1.5 mg/L kinetin. Shoot multiplication from callus cultures was achieved in the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 1.5 mg/L thidiazuron (TDZ). Phenol secretion was controlled by the addition of 250 mg/L of activated charcoal. For rooting, shoots were transferred to MS medium supplemented with several auxins. After root induction, the plants were hardened in earthen pots containing sand, soil, and vermiculite. The contents of honokiol (HK) and magnolol (MG) were determined in different plant materials by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection techniques. This analysis revealed that the honokiol and magnolol content in aerial and underground parts of micropropagated M. dealbata were higher than that observed in wild plants (both 6 months old). Our results suggest that conservation of M. dealbata is possible by means of in vitro multiplication of leaf-derived callus. The usefulness of M. dealbata regeneration and production of HK and MG may be attributed to the proper selection of explant sourcing and identification of the correct growth medium to support adequate growth. This careful selection of explants and growth medium leads to a very useful source of plant material for pharmacological and phytomedicinal screening applications and, above all, would safeguard this plant species from the threat of extinction.;Callus | Honokiol | Magnolia dealbata Zucc. | Magnolidaceae | Magnolol | Micropropagation;14;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

ECG and lung volume were registered from 30 subjects who performed, in sitting and standing, a 70-s continuous linear RF increase from 0.05 to 0.8 Hz at constant tidal volume. From the smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution of the RR intervals and tidal volume series, HFRR and RF were computed to obtain the relation. After logtransformation, correlations were -0.88±0.03 in sitting and -0.89±0.04 in standing. With the postural change the intercept decreased (p<0.001) and the slope increased (p<0.009), indicating a vagal withdrawal.

A paramount aspect in cancer development is the concept that the cell loses its ability to detect and respond to extracellular signals and frequently develops autocrine signals for overcoming normal physiological controls. Therefore, we analyzed the current concepts of general principles in physiological and some oncogenic cell signalling pathway patterns. We carried out a documentary review of 29 scientific items in which we identified intracellular signalling pathway systems In each cell so complex due to the high number of participants and the multiple differences among specific cell types. The knowledge and identification of general principles regarding the whole physiological cell signaling pathway patterns help us to understand the oncogenic signaling pathways. Identification of these pathways In any tumor can be used as prognosis or predictor biomarkers In the patient's outcome or as target in clinical therapeutic trials.;Intracellular signaling pathways | Neoplastic cell;0;0;;;;undefined;

It is much more prevalent in the older population. Treatment efforts to restore retinal function through transplantation have been made for decades. Stem cells of embryonic and adult origin are just beginning to be studied for their potential to differentiate into retinal neurons and incorporate into damaged retinas. Researchers have demonstrated that grafted stem cells survive, migrate, differentiate and integrate within the retina to degrees not observed with other cellular sources. These transplants adopt retina-like morphologies and show synaptic reconnection and some visual recovery in animal studies. Our understanding of stem cell biology and of biochemical ways to manipulate these cells into becoming specific phenotypes is deepening. Further investigation is needed in order to achieve better results before efforts can move into human trials. © 2009 Future Medicine Ltd.;Age-related macular degeneration | Aging | Amd retina | Photoreceptors | Progenitor cell | Rpe | Stem cell | Transplantation;0;0;;;;undefined;

We address this issue by examining associations of smoking with subsequent SROs with and without controls for potential explanatory variables in the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) panel. The latter consists of 5001 people who participated in both the 1990-2002 NCS and the 2001-2003 NCS follow-up survey. Explanatory variables include sociodemographics, potential common causes (parental history of mental-substance disorders; other respondent childhood adversities) and potential mediators (respondent history of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edn, revised mental-substance disorders). Small gross (that is, without controls) prospective associations are found between history of early-onset nicotine dependence and both subsequent suicide ideation and, among ideators, subsequent suicide plans. None of the baseline smoking measures, though, predicts subsequent suicide gestures or attempts among ideators. The smoking-ideation association largely disappear, but the association of early-onset nicotine dependence with subsequent suicide plans persists (odds ratio3.0), after adjustment for control variables. However, the latter association is as strong with remitted as active nicotine dependence, arguing against a direct causal effect of nicotine dependence on suicide plans. Decomposition of the control variable effects, furthermore, suggests that these effects are due to common causes more than to mediators. These results refine our understanding of the ways in which smoking is associated with later SROs and for the most part argue against the view that these associations are due to causal effects of smoking. © 2009 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.";Nicotine dependence | Smoking | Suicide | Suicide attempts | Suicide ideation | Tobacco use;63;0;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01 DA016558;National Institute of Mental Health

The removal of organic matter (OM) and index microorganisms present in an effluent of a wastewater plant was determined using FeO -24 without any pH adjustment. It was observed that concentrations of FeO-24 ranging between 5 and 14mgl -1 inactivated up to 4-log of the index microorganisms (initial concentration c.a. 106 CFU/100 ml) and achieved OM removal up to almost 50%. The performance of FeO-24 was compared with OM oxidation and disinfection using hypochlorite. It was observed that hypochlorite was less effective in OM oxidation and coliform inactivation than ferrate. Results of this work suggest that FeO-24 could be an interesting oxidant able to deactivate pathogenic microorganisms in water with high OM content and readily oxidize organic matter without jeopardizing its efficiency on microorganism inactivation. © IWA Publishing 2009.;Disinfection | Ferrate | Organic matter oxidation | Wastewater | Water reuse;16;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The dietary preferences of 10 white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) subspecies yucatanensis were estimated in the selection of eleven plants growing in the state of Yucatan, using a cafeteria study type. The chemical composition and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of the diet and the different vegetal species were determined, as well as the nutritional balance of the deer (30.2±2.65 kg of BW) fed with those species. The deer selected mainly the arboreal ones (76.52%), with a smaller proportion of forbs (19.37%), herbaceous (5.81%) and a minimum of graminae (0.29%). The legumes Leucaena leucocephala and Brosimum alicastrum constituted 51.20% of the ration. The diet had a composition of 56.97% dry matter, 17.64% crude protein, 42.53% cell walls with an IVDMD of 56.90%. The results of multiple linear regression analyses showed that the arboreal species have a significant impact (P < 0.0006) in the food consumption, whereas the crude protein tended (P < 0.096) to modify it. The analysis of variance showed that dry matter percentage influences the intake (P < 0.0085) in a quadratic form. Although the crude protein did not have an important effect in this analysis (P > 0.1), it presented a significant correlation (r = 0.23; P < 0.05), and none of the other nutrients or digestibility had a significant effect on feed intake. When the vegetal species were evaluated within the same analysis, the arboreal ones showed a significant positive linear effect (P < 0.0012) whereas the herbaceous tended (P < 0.11) to reduce the intake quadratically. It was estimated that the ration meets the maintenance requirements of nitrogen and energy in excess, allowing a maximum of 30% increase in energy for activity over the basal metabolism a reason why the vegetation in Regional University Center can be considered nutritionally excellent due to its protein content and digestibility for the white tailed deer.";Diet | Digestibility | Feed intake | Odocoileus virginianus | Requirements;14;0;;;;undefined;

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most important factor in vascular neoformation and an increase in its expression is associated with tumour progression and a worse prognosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression of VEGF-A and its receptor KDR/VEGF-2 in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), larger or smaller than 10 mm, and with or without extracapsular extension (PTC-E and PTC-NE). Methods: VEGF-A and KDR were studied with tissue microarray (TMA) in a total of 62 cases of PTC-E and PTC-NE larger and smaller than 10mm. Results: the positivity of VEGF-A and KDR was predominantly similar in PTC-E and PTC-NE with no statistical significance between tumour size and PTC-E and PTC-NE. However, the intensity of expression was higher for PTC-E >10mm, while KDR was more frequently expressed in PTC-NE ≤10mm. The intensity was similar for both groups and sizes. Conclusion: the results obtained correlate with previously published results, however, there are no reports in the literature related to the correlation of extracapsular extension and VEGF-A and KDR. Whereas the expression of KDR was similar in both groups, VEGFA was higher in PTC-E >10mm, which would indicate that an over expression of VEGF-A may be related to extracapsular invasion. © 2009 Sociedad Española de Anatomía Patológica y Sociedad Española de Citología.;Carcinoma papilar de tiroides | Factores pronóstico de carcinoma papilar de tiroides | Immunohistochemistry | Inmunohistoquímica | KDR | Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid | Prognostic factors in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid | VEGF | VEGFR-2;0;0;;;;undefined;

Design: Seven-year-old school children (53 boys and 57 girls) were recruited to measure their SSFR in mL/min. Paraffin-stimulated saliva was collected from each child at baseline and once annually, over six years. Forty-four boys and 46 girls remained in the cohort (dropout rate 18%). Cluster analysis was applied to evaluate the natural grouping of individuals according to their SSFR. Partition analysis was applied to calculate the SSFR cut-off value to predict a child's salivation trend. Results: Cluster analysis revealed that as they grew-up these children consistently showed one of three different SSFR patterns. The cut-off values to predict a child's salivation trend were 1.76 mL/min for the high SSFR cluster, and 0.5 mL/min for the low SSFR cluster. Conclusions: These findings indicate that a high or low SSFR is a constant individual trait in children. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Mental disorders are among the strongest predictors of suicide; however, little is known about which disorders are uniquely predictive of suicidal behavior, the extent to which disorders predict suicide attempts beyond their association with suicidal thoughts, and whether these associations are similar across developed and developing countries. This study was designed to test each of these questions with a focus on nonfatal suicide attempts. Methods and Findings: Data on the lifetime presence and age-of-onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) mental disorders and nonfatal suicidal behaviors were collected via structured face-to-face interviews with 108,664 respondents from 21 countries participating in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys. The results show that each lifetime disorder examined significantly predicts the subsequent first onset of suicide attempt (odds ratios [ORs] = 2.9-8.9). After controlling for comorbidity, these associations decreased substantially (ORs = 1.5-5.6) but remained significant in most cases. Overall, mental disorders were equally predictive in developed and developing countries, with a key difference being that the strongest predictors of suicide attempts in developed countries were mood disorders, whereas in developing countries impulse-control, substance use, and post-traumatic stress disorders were most predictive. Disaggregation of the associations between mental disorders and nonfatal suicide attempts showed that these associations are largely due to disorders predicting the onset of suicidal thoughts rather than predicting progression from thoughts to attempts. In the few instances where mental disorders predicted the transition from suicidal thoughts to attempts, the significant disorders are characterized by anxiety and poor impulse-control. The limitations of this study include the use of retrospective self-reports of lifetime occurrence and age-of-onset of mental disorders and suicidal behaviors, as well as the narrow focus on mental disorders as predictors of nonfatal suicidal behaviors, each of which must be addressed in future studies. Conclusions:This study found that a wide range of mental disorders increased the odds of experiencing suicide ideation. However, after controlling for psychiatric comorbidity, only disorders characterized by anxiety and poor impulse-control predict which people with suicide ideation act on such thoughts. These findings provide a more fine-grained understanding of the associations between mental disorders and subsequent suicidal behavior than previously available and indicate that mental disorders predict suicidal behaviors similarly in both developed and developing countries. Future research is needed to delineate the mechanisms through which people come to think about suicide and subsequently progress from ideation to attempts. © 2009 Nock et al.";;539;1;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH059575;National Institute of Mental Health

Regarding environmental factors, it is known that the change in lifestyle plays a major role in the development of obesity. All obese child should been assessed in a holistic approach, intentionally looking for the presence of co morbidities associated to obesity.

In spite of international tendencies to commercialize meat cuts while decreasing live animal transit, transport is still one of the major problems in terms of animal welfare, besides carcass and meat by-products' quality. The present review analyzes, in general terms, the different definitions on animal welfare and factors affecting pig welfare in transit. Several case studies are referred to as examples, showing the animal response to stress during transport and its effects on both meat quality and the economic impact. In addition, legal requirements and Mexican regulations for pig transportation are also described. Information in regard to swine stress and welfare in transit, considers a number of factors that alter the animal metabolic homeostasis with subsequent negative effects on pork quality. It is conclude that knowledge on basic animal behavioral and physiological needs during transport, as well as a suitable training of personnel, are necessary for reducing animal welfare problems. Last but not least, some recommendations on handling practices are given in order to improve swine welfare during transit.;Animal welfare | Load density | Meat quality | Mexican legislation | Swine | Transport;13;0;;;;undefined;

In Mexico in recent years, the prevalence of fluorosis has increased by the exposure to different fluoridated sources such as those found in soft drinks and beverages. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of dental fluorosis among school children living in Nezahualcoyotl, state of Mexico and identify associated risk factors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 455 children aged 6-13 years who had been assessed by a previously standardized observer following WHO criteria. We administered The Community Fluorosis index (FCI) and a survey that analyzed the exposure to fluorides hidden in carbonated drinks, juices, bottled water, tea and the use of fluoride toothpastes. Results: The prevalence of dental fluorosis was 73.4%. Very mild and mild fluorosis were the more common levels. The Community Fluorosis index (ICF) was 1.18 ± 0.80. School children living at Nezahualcoyotl that answered they did drink hidden fluorides > 0.71 ppm thought bottled beverages were more of a risk to develop dental fluorosis (RM 1,554, 95% CI 1.016-2.378, p<0.05). Conclusions: Dental fluorosis results from fluoride intake by different sources, however our study, consumption of fluoride hidden in soft and bottled drinks showed a significant correlation with observed fluorosis.;Dental fluorosis | Hidden fluoride | Risk factors;5;0;;;;undefined;

Seedlings of ten native cloud forest succession tree species and the exotic species Casuarina were combined in five assemblages of different composition and richness. Their effect was noticeable on five out of eight soil properties analyzed. The one that included Casuarina stood out on height, and had the highest levels of most of the nutrients, particularly nitrogen. More than half of the trees sown remained alive after the initial two years of the experiment (1999 and 2001). Assemblages affected individual survival time as well as growth variables. Plant cover was most rapid and extensively formed by the native species assemblages; those that included oaks, showed high levels of some nutrients. The richest assemblage displayed intermediate levels in soil and plant variables. The inclusion of the rapid growth species Casuarina was validated to enhance nutrient accumulation on degraded soils. The results suggest that initial rehabilitation can be achieved by the assemblage establishment. © 2009 Asociación Interciencia.";;3;0;;;;undefined;

The sample included 4,204 Latinos (2,178 women and 2,024 men); data were weighted. Analyses were linear and logistic regressions. Controlling for survey year, severity, and other covariates, male gender and English language interview predicted higher utilization generally and Alcoholics Anonymous use specifically; English interview was also associated with institutional treatment. (Effects for gender on general utilization were marginal.) Other predictors of utilization included older age, lower education, greater social pressures, greater legal consequences, greater dependence symptoms, and public insurance. Whereas men and women differed little on perceived barriers, analyses showed greater barriers among Spanish (vs. English) interviewees. Latina women's underutilization of alcohol treatment requires further research but may be partially explained by stigma.

We analyze the dispersal of maize transgenes via seeds in Mexico, the crop's cradle. Methods: We use immunoassays (ELISA) to screen for the activity of recombinant proteins in a nationwide sample of farmer seed stocks. We estimate critical parameters of seed population dynamics using household survey data and combine these estimates with analytical results to examine presumed sources and mechanisms of dispersal. Results: Recombinant proteins Cry1Ab/Ac and CP4/EPSPS were found in 3.1% and 1.8% of samples, respectively. They are most abundant in southeast Mexico but also present in the west-central region. Diffusion of seed and grain imported from the United States might explain the frequency and distribution of transgenes in west-central Mexico but not in the southeast. Conclusions: Understanding the potential for transgene survival and dispersal should help design methods to regulate the diffusion of germplasm into local seed stocks. Further research is needed on the interactions between formal and informal seed systems and grain markets in centers of crop origin and diversification. © 2009 Dyer et al.;;59;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The administration of L-Dopa diminishes pain perception in humans as well as the response to nociceptive stimuli in animals. Also, the intracerebral microinjection of dopamine in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models (formalin test and deafferentation, respectively) reduces nociceptive response. In this sense, the selective activation of dopamine D2 receptors and the blockade of D1 in the insular cortex and spinal cord diminish nociception. Furthermore, the microinjection of dopamine or amantadine (dopamine releaser) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) also reduces chronic nociception. The efficacy of amantadine has been tested in the treatment of neuropathic pain, even when given as a single dose. There is evidence of the role of amantadine as a releaser of dopamine (DA) calcium channel (N type) dependent in the striatum as well as a low affinity non-competitive antagonist of blockade/non-blockade kinetics of the NMDA receptor. This compound has also been described as a DA agonist and an inhibitor of its reuptake. With this background, we decided to test if the effects of systemically given amantadine related to acute nociception, hyperalgesia and neuropathic nociception can be reverted by a dopaminergic blockade (using haloperidol) within the ACC. The experiments were conducted in agreement with the Ethics Committee of the International Association for the Study of Pain and the approval of the Projects Commission of the Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatría Ramón de la Fuente (INPRF). Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were housed in the INPRF. During the observation period, the animals were maintained in transparent acrylic individual cages with light-dark cycles of 12 × 12 h, with feeding and hydration ad libitum. For all surgical procedures, rats were anaesthetised with halothane 2% mixed with O2 98%. In order to test the dopaminergic effect of amantadine within the ACC in nociception, we used the hyperalgesia model as well as a neuropathic nociception model induced by denervation. In the model of hyperalgesia, carrageenan was injected in the plantar region (50 μl at 1%), followed by a thermonociception test in which paw withdrawal latency was measured. In the neuropathic nociception model, the right sciatic nerve was denervated and chronic nociception was measured as autotomy behaviour. Moreover, in another series of experiments, haloperidol (3 mg/200 nl) was microinjected into the ACC before the induction of hyperalgesia and neuropathic nociception. Amantadine was then injected (90 mg/kg i.p.) and the behavioural development was observed in both models. Systemic amantadine was able to reduce both neuropathic nociception and hyperalgesia. Also, the results show, on the one hand, that haloperidol significantly decreases the antinociceptive effect of amantadine measured as paw withdrawal latency. On the other hand, amantadine can reduce nociception when administered systemically and, according to what has been published previously, when administered directly into the ACC. Our results show that amantadine is effective in diminishing hyperalgesia and nociception induced by deafferentation. This suggests that amantadine can be a therapeutic alternative for the treatment and prevention of neuropathic pain such as phantom limb pain or pain due to deafferentation, among others.;Amantadine | Anterior cingulate cortex | Chronic pain | Dopamine | NMDA;4;0;;;;undefined;

Method: Twenty three untreated patients were studied and compared with a matched control group. Diagnosis of narcolepsy was carried out employing a clinical interview, a polysomnographic (PSG) record, and an MSLT. Results: Subjective number of awakenings was the SSQ indicator that best correlated with EDS (ESS and MSLT). Regarding clinical features, diurnal tiredness and sleep paralysis correlated with ESS values. Increase in ESS was related with decrease in total sleep time, SWS, and sleep onset latency.

Transduction and transmission of these signalling pathways are dependent on integrated molecular circuits. A paramount aspect in cancer development is the concept that the cell loses its ability to detect and respond to extracellular signals and frequently develops autocrine signals for overcoming normal physiological controls. Therefore, we analyzed the current concepts of general principles in physiological and some oncogenic cell signalling pathway patterns. We carried out a documentary review of 29 scientific items in which we identified intracellular signalling pathway systems in each cell so complex due to the high number of participants and the multiple differences among specific cell types. The knowledge and identification of general principles regarding the whole physiological cell signaling pathway patterns help us to understand the oncogenic signaling pathways. Identification of these pathways in any tumor can be used as prognosis or predictor biomarkers in the patient's outcome or as target in clinical therapeutic trials.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

However, previous studies have reported poor reliability (repeatability) of HRV measures in children at rest and during light exercise. Whether the reliability can be improved by controlling variables such as physical activity, breathing rate and tidal volume, or by selecting non-conventional techniques for analysing the data remains as an open question. We evaluated the short-term repeatability of RR-interval data from medicated children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH). The α1 exponents, obtained by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), from the data of 21 children collected at two different sessions were compared. Elapsed days between sessions were 59 33, and data were obtained during 10 min, trying to restrict the children's activity while being seated. We found statistical agreement between the means of α1 exponents for each session (p = 0.94) and no bias with a low-coefficient variation (9.1%); an intraclass correlation coefficient ri = 0.48 ([0.14 0.72], 95% confidence interval) was also estimated. These findings, which were compared with results obtained by conventional time and frequency techniques, indicate the existence of agreement between the α1 exponents obtained at each session, thereby providing support concerning the repeatability of HRV data as analysed by DFA in children with congenital hypothyroidism. Of particular interest was also the agreement found by using the central frequency of the high-frequency band and the parameter pNN20, both showing better or similar ri than α1 (0.77 [0.57 0.89] and 0.51 [0.17 0.74], respectively), yet considerably better repeatability than other conventional time and frequency parameters. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.";Interchangeability | Intraclass correlation | RR dynamics | Scaling exponent;4;0;;;;undefined;

Leaf samples were the best explants for callus establishment and metabolite production, and Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 1 mg/L 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 1 mg/L kinetin yielded 2.3 mg/g of honokiol and 5.9 mg/g of magnolol. Bacterial and fungal contamination was inhibited with a multiple-step tissue sterilization procedure. Oxidation was inhibited with 1 g/L activated charcoal. Cell-suspension batch cultures derived from friable callus obtained from leaves of this species were grown for 30 days in shaker flasks containing Murashige and Skoog medium. Throughout the growth cycle, honokiol and magnolol levels, fresh and dry weight, and sucrose uptake were determined. The effects of carbon source concentration on biomass accumulation and the synthesis of bioactive compounds were studied. By using 3 mL of inocula supplemented with 3% (w/v) sucrose, maximum yields of honokiol (8.1 mg/g) and magnolol (13.4 mg/g) were obtained after 25 days.

Both experiments included four treatments: 1. Control, sorghum+soybean meal diet; 2. Control diet + enzymes; 3. Low-nutrient sorghum+soybean meal diet (7% reduction in crude protein (CP), amino acids (AA) and metabolizable energy (ME); and 4. Low-nutrient diet + enzymes. A completely randomized design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement was used in both experiments; one factor was diets (control and low-nutrient) and the other factor was addition or not of enzymes. Exp 1 included 240 Ross 308 broiler chicks in a trial from 1 to 21 d of age, and Exp 2 included 280 Ross 308 chicks in a trial from 1 to 49 d of age. At 21 d in Exp 1, weight gain was lower (P<0.05) in the low-nutrient diets but improved with addition of enzymes. Ileal amino acid digestibility and ME was best (3.0% and 6.5% respectively) in the low-nutrient diet with enzymes. At 49 d in Exp 2, weight gain was lower (P<0.05) in the low-nutrient diets but improved with addition of enzymes. Addition of the enzyme mixture improved the nutritional value of sorghum-soybean meal diets for broilers by increasing amino acid digestibility and metabolizable energy.

Immunohistochemistry was performed for syndecan-1 and Ki-67 in seven ameloblastomas (four DA and three PA) and three AC. Expression of syndecan-1 was related to the histological subtype of tumors and, in the case of malignancy, to lower expression levels observed in AC (22.5%) than in PA (47.5%) or DA (77.5%) (P < 0.05). Syndecan-1 expression correlated inversely with Ki-67 proliferative index: the expression was lower in both types of ameloblastomas (1.5% in DA and 6.4% in PA) than in AC (41.2%; P < 0.05). The present results suggest that the decrease in syndecan-1 expression and increase in the Ki-67 index observed in AC is in accordance with its higher aggressiveness as compared to the rare DA and PA. Interestingly, DA had a lower proliferation index as well as the highest levels of syndecan-1 expression. These data suggest that DA differ from the other types of intraosseous ameloblastomas but more studies are necessary to better understand the role of this protein as a marker in the biological behavior of the epithelial odontogenic neoplasms. © 2009 Japanese Society of Pathology.";Ameloblastic carcinoma | CD138 | Desmoplastic ameloblastoma | Ki-67 | Peripheral ameloblastoma | Syndecan-1;47;0;;;;undefined;

Fifteen of the animals received a supplement (SG) during 45 days with molasses-urea mixture (2 kg molasses + 407 g urea/head/day), plus 10 g of ruminally protected methionine. The other sixteen heifers did not receive supplement (CG). Fecal and pastures samples were collected to assess dry herbage intake and digestibility. Serial ultrasound measurements from the ovary were performed in both groups to evaluate follicular dynamics. The heifers were categorized according to their follicular size and presence of a CL. Forage intake and dry matter digestibility were reduced (P < 0.05) and body condition tended to improve (P = 0.07) in the supplemented heifers, however, total intake, final weight, daily gain and dorsal back fat were not affected. After the supplementation period, the percentage of females in the categories < 3 mm and 3 to < 6 mm, was greater (P < 0.05) in CG (25% and 43.7%) that in SG (0% and 26.6%) but in the follicle category of ≥ 9 mm, the percentage of animals was 60% in SG and 18.8% in CG (P < 0.05).

Previously it has been reported that administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in MDD patients modify cortisol and cytokine levels but these studies only evaluated changes over a short time period. This work reports the long-term effects of administration of SSRI on the cortisol levels and pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine profile in a group of MDD patients treated for 52 weeks. A total of 31 patients diagnosed with MDD received anti depressant treatment with SSRI. HDRS and BDI were administered over a year, and levels of interleukin IL-1β, IL-10, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13, and 24-h urine cortisol were determined at weeks (W) 0, 5, 20, 36 and 52 of treatment. Before treatment we found high levels of cortisol, IL-4, IL-13 (Th2) and IL-10 in MDD patients when compared with healthy volunteers. At W20 psychiatric scales indicated a remission of the depressive episode concomitantly with increments in IL-2 and IL-1β but without changes in cortisol. Towards the end of the treatment (W52) we observed a significant reduction (p < 0.01) in cortisol levels, with an increment in IL-1β and IFN-γ and a decrease in Th2 cytokines. Our results suggest that depressed patients only reach a partial reestablishment of HPA axis function after the long-term administration of SSRI. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.;Cortisol | Cytokines | HDRS | HPA axis | MDD | SSRI;112;0;;;INPRFM;CONACYT-SALUD-2003-C01-14;Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatría Ramón de la Fuente Muñiz

Information about the epidemiology of such behavior is important for policy-making and prevention. The authors reviewed government data on suicide and suicidal behavior and conducted a systematic review of studies on the epidemiology of suicide published from 1997 to 2007. The authors' aims were to examine the prevalence of, trends in, and risk and protective factors for suicidal behavior in the United States and cross-nationally. The data revealed significant cross-national variability in the prevalence of suicidal behavior but consistency in age of onset, transition probabilities, and key risk factors. Suicide is more prevalent among men, whereas nonfatal suicidal behaviors are more prevalent among women and persons who are young, are unmarried, or have a psychiatric disorder. Despite an increase in the treatment of suicidal persons over the past decade, incidence rates of suicidal behavior have remained largely unchanged. Most epidemiologic research on suicidal behavior has focused on patterns and correlates of prevalence. The next generation of studies must examine synergistic effects among modifiable risk and protective factors. New studies must incorporate recent advances in survey methods and clinical assessment. Results should be used in ongoing efforts to decrease the significant loss of life caused by suicidal behavior.;Psychiatry | Public health | Risk factors | Self-injurious behavior | Suicide | Suicide, attempted;1585;1;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH077883;National Institute of Mental Health

Treatments included control, monensin (25 mg d-1 virginamycin (15 mg d-1) and sodium bicarbonate (10 g d-1) intraruminally. Each period included 14 d of adaptation and 4 d of sample collection. Ruminal fluid samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 h after the additive dose. Blood samples were collected at 0 and 6 h to determine pH, HCO3, pCO2, base excess, electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl-) and other metabolites (glucose, urea, L-lactate, NEFA). Intake was increased (p<0.05) with virginiamycin in comparison with sodium bicarbonate. Addition of sodium bicarbonate reduced significantly (p<0.05) DM intake. Sheep with monensin showed increased proportion of propionate at time of feeding, while virgmiamycm lowered percentage of acetate in rumen liquor sampled 10 hours after feeding.

In the present research a new transfection promoter agent for a non viral expression vector was used, using as a model a plasmid expressing the gene that codifies for the G glycoprotein of the rabies virus. The objective was to evaluate the ability of AL27 to increase the rabies plasmid transfection in in vitro and in vivo conditions. The AL27 fraction was isolated from the venom of Agkistrodon piscivorus by HPLC-RP. AL27 maintained its recognition by sialic acid receptors up to a titer of 64 HU. The pC38 plasmid was selected from a panel of 18 clones constructed by inserting the gene that codifies for glycoprotein G of rabies strain HQIMSS99 into the commercial pCI-neo expression vector. In vitro results showed that pC38, with or without AL27, transfected CHO cells under the calcium-phosphate system and using Confocal Microscopy (CM) increased fluorescence (+++) was observed with the mixture pC38/AL27, than with pC38 alone (++). Flow cytometry (FC) revealed expression percentages of 27.78 and 38.66% for pC38 and pC38/AL27, respectively. The in vivo experiment was performed using three groups of BALB/C mice: group 1 was inoculated with pC38 in the tibial muscle; group 2 with pC38 and AL27 and group 3, negative control, with only PBS. Tissues showed the highest expression by CM (+++) when using pC38/AL27. Antibodies detected ranged from 0.75-1.2 international units (IU) mL-1 for pC38 and from 1.1-1.27 IU mL -1 for pC38/AL27. Results showed that AL27 promoted cell entrance mechanisms, generating a better expression level of the gene that codifies for the G glycoprotein of the rabies virus and consequently enhancing the stimulation of the immune response. © Medwell Journals, 2008.";Agkistrodon piscivorus | Hemoagglutinins | Lectins | Plasmids;0;0;;;;undefined;

Clinically, onychomycosis is manifested by changes on the color, texture and thickness of the nail. The agent most frequently found in this disease is Tricophyton rubrum. The present study evaluated the therapeutic effectiveness and tolerability of topical administration of A. pichinchensis extract on the nails of patients with the clinical and mycological diagnosis of onychomycosis. A phytopharmaceutical formulation was developed in a lacquer solution containing the standardized (encecalin) extract of A. pichinchensis. A similar lacquer solution containing 8% ciclopirox was used as control. Treatments were assigned randomly and administered topically for 6 months. Ninety six patients concluded the study (49 in the experimental group and 47 in the control); 71.1 % of patients from the experimental and 80.9% from the control group showed therapeutic effectiveness, while 59.1% and 63.8% from the experimental and control group, respectively, achieved mycological effectiveness.

Each salt and salinity produced a differential retardation in sprouts emergence, closely related with the sprouting percentage analyzed in a previous experiment. This retardation is due to 1) the osmotic effect of NaCl, Na2SO 4, CaCl2·2H2O, sulphatic-chlorhidric salinity and chlorhidric-sulphatic salinity, and 2) the toxic effect of MgCl2·6H2O, MgSO4·7H 2O, NaHCO3 and sulphatic-sodic salinity. Both effects increase the dormancy period of the tubers, and generally the toxic effect of alkaline-sodic salts is more intense. The saline effect extended the phase of vegetative growth and retarded tuber initiation. The poor development of leaves in the tubers initiation period caused a slow rate of growth of the potato tubers and small potatoes were produced. The phenomenon was more pronounced in plants subjected to sulphatic-sodic salinity and NaHCO3 in concentrations higher than 3.84g·l-1, when dwarf plants and plants without tubers were produced.;;3;0;;;;undefined;

Syndecan-1 is a cell surface proteoglycan that binds cells to the extracellular matrix and its expression is down-regulated in many cellular transformation models. The aims of this study were to examine the pattern of syndecan-1 expression, to evaluate the proliferating activity in a large series of solid/multicystic (SA) and unicystic ameloblastomas (UA), and to study its possible correlation to their biological behavior. Immunohistochemical studies were performed for syndecan-1 (clone MI15) and Ki-67 (clone MIB-1) in 120 ameloblastomas (75 SA and 45 UA). The salient finding was that expression of syndecan-1 was related to the histological subtype of tumors, as there was a lower expression in SA (40.2%) as compared to UA (49.7%) (p < 0.05). These findings did not correlate with Ki-67 expression, as this was similar in both types of ameloblastomas. Our results suggest that the reduced expression of syndecan-1 supports the view that SA has a more aggressive biological behavior than the UA. The lack of correlation between reduction of the syndecan-1 and Ki-67 index may be due to the different histomorphologies of both types of ameloblastoma, and more studies are necessary to better understand the role of this protein in the biological behavior of these tumors. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The possible pathogenic role of DcR3 in SLE was also assessed. Serum DcR3 levels of 90 SLE patients, 11 patients with rheumatic conditions and 123 healthy controls were determined by ELISA. In all, 43% of the SLE patients, 9% of patients with rheumatic conditions and 2.4% of the normal healthy individuals presented elevated serum DcR3 levels. A higher percentage of DcR3-positive SLE patients, compared with DcR3-negative SLE patients, showed abnormally high serum IgE levels, a surrogate marker of Th2-type immune responses. To determine the cause and effect relationship of DcR3 expression and a Th2-prone status, we studied young DcR3 transgenic (Tg) mice, whose transgene was driven by an actin promoter. These mice had IL-4 overproduction and augmented serum IgE levels, signs of dominant Th2 immune responses. To determine possible SLE pathogenic roles of DcR3, the T-cell-depleted bone marrow of DcR3 Tg mice was transplanted into lethally irradiated syngeneic C57BL/6 female mice. The recipients developed an SLE-like syndrome. They presented anti-dsDNA and anti-nuclear antibodies, along with renal and liver pathology compatible with that of SLE. In total, 90% of Tg bone marrow-transplanted mice, compared with 20% of wild-type bone marrow-transplanted mice, perished within 12 months after the transplantation. Our results showed that serum DcR3 could serve as an additional parameter for SLE diagnosis and that DcR3 secreted from cells of hematopoietic origin was SLE pathogenic in mice. © The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2008.

The professional activity must consider, health education for patients with as a benchmark that would guide to the handling of some of their health problems, the healthy functioning of their body in order to help to reach a good care of the social health of the community. The word vice and its moral connotations, having already permeated social education on health, is threatening and requires prompt and forced solution to avoid that the patient mentally ill and/or abuser addicted be considered as a bad person and no longer a patient: it is then a vicious person, not worthy of respect and attention, but worthy of punishment.

In this study we determined the contribution of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the RAIC regarding nociception processing in a neuropathic pain model, as well as inflammatory articular nociception measured as pain-induced functional impairment in the rat (PIFIR). Microinjection of vehicle or substances into the RAIC was performed after the induction of nociception. The groups were treated with: a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist (SCH-23390), a dopamine D1 receptor agonist (SKF-38393), a dopamine D2 receptor agonist (TNPA) and a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist (spiperone). Chronic nociception, induced by denervation, was measured by the autotomy score in which onset and incidence were also determined. The SCH-23390 and TNPA groups showed a decrease in the autotomy score and a delay on the onset as compared to control, whereas the PIFIR groups did not show statistical differences. This work shows the differential role of dopamine receptors within the RAIC in which the activation of D2 or the blockade of D1 receptors elicit antinociception. © 2007 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.;Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors | Insula | Limbic | Pain;65;0;;;;185496;

Methods: The data are from a representative multistage probability household survey of 3,005 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years residing in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area that was carried out in 2005. We used discrete time survival analyses to model the net impact of retrospectively reported prior occurrence of traumatic events on ideation, plans and attempts, taking into account the onset of psychiatric disorders. Results: Prevalence of suicidality was high among respondents with traumatic events, ranging from a 43% prevalence of suicidal ideation among those with a history of 'Being raped' to a 25% prevalence of suicide attempts among those that reported 'Purposely injured, tortured or killed someone.' In cross-sectional estimates, any traumatic event was associated with an increase of 3.2 times the odds of suicide ideation, 5.1 times the odds of a plan and 6.6 times the odds of an attempt. Number of events was also associated with increasing suicidality such that those with three or more events were 13.7 times more likely to report a suicide attempt than those with none. Multivariate discrete time survival models that took into account a large number of demographic, suicide-related and psychiatric disorder variables reduced in strength but did not alter these basic relationships. Conclusions: We conclude that traumatic events such as rape and sexual assault have a profound impact upon suicidality and that this relationship is not entirely explained by the onset of psychiatric disorders. Comprehensive interventions for adolescent victims of traumatic events, especially those with a history of cumulative events, should include, but not be restricted to, treatment of any associated psychiatric disorder. © 2007 The Authors.;Adolescence | Epidemiology | Mexico | Risk factors | Suicide | Survey | Trauma;55;0;;;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

Laboratory animals have been very useful in studying the effects of varying levels of malnutrition because non-nutritional factors that affect humans may be controlled. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of moderate and severe malnutrition on lymphocyte proportions and activation markers of T cells in experimentally malnourished rats during lactation by flow cytometry. Lower absolute (total) and relative (%) numbers of CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocyte subpopulations were observed in moderately (second degree) and severely (third degree) malnourished rats compared with well-nourished rats (P < 0.05). Both groups of malnourished rats showed a significant decrease in the percentage of CD71 + cells at 24 h post-activation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). After 24 h activation of spleen cells with PHA, a lower percentage of CD25 + cells was observed in malnourished than well-nourished rats (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of this study indicated an altered expression of CD71 and CD25 during activation of T lymphocytes in malnourished rats and may partially explain increased susceptibility to infection associated with malnutrition. Moreover, these results demonstrated that moderate malnutrition affects the response of T lymphocytes as much as severe malnutrition. © 2008 The Author(s).;CD25 | CD71 | Flow cytometry | Lymphocyte activation | Malnutrition;24;0;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The assessment of urinary fluoride excretion during dental developing stage has been reported for different countries with community fluoride programs. Also, one of the factors that could influence on retention and excretion of fluoride is the deficient nutrition so the aim of this study was to determine fluoride urinary excretion by a group of preschool children with and without malnutrition. Materials and methods. Urinary samples from 24 hours were collected from 60 preschool children selected by convenience from Iztapalapa area of Mexico City, 30 with malnutrition and 30 with standard nutritrional status by weight for age. The samples were analyzed by fluoride especific electrode. Orion 720A. Results. The average concentration of fluoride in urine from preschool children with and without malnutrition were 0.89 ± 0.4 mg/L and 0.80 ± 0.3 mg/L, respectively. The mean of 24 hours total fluoride excreted were 367 ± 150 μg/24 hrs. in malnutrition children and 355 ± 169 μg/24 hrs. for those with standard nutritional status. There were no differences statistically significant between groups. Conclusion. The urinary fluoride excretion for children with and without malnutrition were in the optimal range of fluoridation for the prevention of caries decay.

Suicidal conduct is one of the most important mental health problems in the young population, with sexual orientation as a risk factor, since homosexuals show higher probability of suicide as compared to heterosexuals. Suicidal conduct is associated with prior health problems such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, related to predisposing factors like formative experiences with personality. The current study takes a qualitative approach to explore the risk of mental health disorders in homosexuals, associated with suicidal conduct, based on their experience with homophobia in primary and secondary socialization settings. Discourse analysis revealed the relationship interviewees assigned to social rejection of their sexuality and key symptoms of depression (sadness), anxiety (fear), and suicidal conduct (intent and ideation).;Depression | Male homossexuality | Mental health | Sexual behavior;11;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Several scales have been developed in an attempt to specifically detect some of the major aspects of depression, i.e. anhedonia, sadness, hopelessness. On the other hand, in adults depression frequently induces changes in sleep patterns, particularly a shortening in REM sleep latency. The alteration of sleep patterns in depressed children has been a matter of controversy. It is possible that a diagnostic deficiency might be the source of the contradictory reports. In the present study, The Child Depression Inventory, a rating scale specifically developed for child depression was applied to 396 school children (8-12 years of age). Nearly 15% of the children (N=45) obtained scores higher than the established limit in this test for normal healthy subjects. A sample of children found within the highest (N=25) and within the lowest (N=25) scores in the scale were selected. After a clinical evaluation, only those who meet the inclusion criteria (N=21 for depressed and N=7 for healthy controls) were electroencephalographically recorded. Children with depressive symptoms showed a significant shortening in REM sleep latency (mean=108 min) when compared to non-depressed (mean=150 min). In addition, significant increases were observed in sleep latency, REM sleep duration and the number of awakenings. Furthermore, results showed an unexpected high frequency of EEG abnormalities in children with depressive symptoms (75%) characterized by sharp waves and polyspikes in the frontal region. The present results support the notion that depression, in children, is accompanied by changes in sleep patterns, mainly concerning REM sleep.;Child depression | Depression Inventory | EEG abnormalities | Hopelessness Scale | REM sleep;22;0;;;CONACYT;32417;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Sex, age of the victims, kind and number of weapons used, wounds endured, and the situation in which the corpses found were registered. The greater mortality by homicide due to homosexual orientation was recorded in men (95%); it was found that the cases accumulated in the cohort of the third and fourth decades of their age (43%). The homicides were characterized by extreme violence which included the use of various arm types (33%) and wounds (32%). The most frequent situations that occurred were finding the corpses naked and tied (13%). The features of the homicide against homosexuals are associated to the general attributes of the predominant masculinity model; therefore, at a macro social level, some reasons are found in the social construction of homophobia.

Plants of 21 days after sowing (DAS) were sprayed with BAP (0.1mM) or water (control) every 3 days for 20 days. Delay of leaf senescence in BAP treated plants was monitored by quantification of chlorophyll and totally soluble protein. Gas exchange was estimated by stomatal conductance (g s and CO2 fixation rate. The water relationships were evaluated by the water potential (ψA and its components, osmotic (ψs) and turgor potential (ψt) every 5 days for 20 days. BAP treated leaves showed higher total concentration of chlorophyll and protein from day 26, in compari son with the control. The difference increased with time and 41 DAS they were 7 times higher than the control. The g s values were not significantly different from the pre-senescent green state. These responses were associated with higher CO2 fixation rates with concentrations near those in the pre-senescent green leaves (6.2μmol·CO2·m-2·s-1). The ψA remained constant under BAP and ψs was significantly lower than in the controls, favoring the retention of solutes in cytoplasm of leaves with delay of senescence. The ψt of BAP leaves was significantly higher than the respective controls from 31 to 41 DAS. Therefore, cytokinin BAP promoted the maintenance of the CO2 fixation rate and water relationships during the delay of leaf senescence.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

The pathologies of poverty and those of the developed countries coexist. Therefore, scientific research is seen as a possible contribution to the prevention of illnesses. OBJECTI VE: To conduct a metrical exercise using as an object of study the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), the institution that provides healthcare to the majority of the Mexican population to find out its research performance. It is expected that the X-ray obtained will contribute to a diagnosis of the research conducted by the Institute. METHODS: Through the Web of Science the cited articles of the personnel assigned to the Mexican Social Security Institute that were published in the mainstream journals between 1995 and 1999, the last five-year period of the governing party that ruled the country for 70 years, were identified. RESULTS: 581 papers were cite and the rate of annual publication was stable; however citations received were scarce. The most represented disciplines were experimental medicine, endocrinology, general and internal medicine, rheumatology and genetics. CONCLUSIONS: The Mexican Social Security Institute has capacity, competitiveness and stability to conduct research; however the poverty suffered by millions of Mexicans, related to hunger, malnutrition and the consequent lack of health make necessary a change of its orientation.";Health sciences | Metrics | Mexican social security institute | Mexico | Scientific research;0;0;;;;undefined;

Aims: To report on the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal behaviours across 17 countries. Method: A total of 84850 adults were interviewed regarding suicidal behaviours and socio-demographic and psychiatric risk factors. Results: The cross-national lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts is 9.2% (s.e.=0.1), 3.1% (s.e.=0.1), and 2.7% (s.e.=0.1). Across all countries, 60% of transitions from ideation to plan and attempt occur within the first year after ideation onset. Consistent cross-national risk factors included being female, younger, less educated, unmarried and having a mental disorder. Interestingly, the strongest diagnostic risk factors were mood disorders in high-income countries but impulse control disorders in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusion: There is cross-national variability in the prevalence of suicidal behaviours, but strong consistency in the characteristics and risk factors for these behaviours.

In this study we compared the ABR of healthy children, under 1-year-old, with children who suffered from perinatal encephalopathy (PE). Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize the ABR differences between children with PE and healthy children in order to identify groups with specific neurophysiological profiles, associated with their neurological condition. Methods: Thirty-six children with perinatal encephalopathy (PE) and 36 healthy children, ages 1-12 months, were studied. The variables considered were: latencies of waves I, II, N1, III, V, and N2; interpeak latency interval (IPL) of waves I-III, III-V, and I-V; as well as amplitudes of waves I, III, and V. The results were analyzed using ANOVA, as well as Ji2, and Ward's cluster analysis. Results: The absolute latencies of the ABR showed an inverse correlation with the children's age. Latencies of waves I, II, N1, V, and N2, IPL III-V, and amplitude of waves III and V show significant differences (p < 0.05) between healthy and PE children. Children with PE showed greater absolute latencies and larger wave amplitudes than the control group. Ward's cluster analysis, used to define the groups with similar functional characteristics, revealed three groups: fast, intermediate, and slow-responders, depending on their wave latencies and IPL wave amplitudes. These groups were gender- (p < 0.03), age- (p < 0.0001), and neurological damage- (p < 0.01) related. Conclusions: Our data clearly show that the ABR obtained from PE children differ from ABR obtained from healthy children. PE infants showed larger wave latencies, intervals amplitudes than the control group. Three functional profiles resulted from the groups established using the Ward's method, and these indicate their neurological functional condition. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: We designed a matched case-control study. Cases were individuals with newly diagnosed OSCC, age- and sex-matched with controls (1:4). Demographic and clinical data were obtained; also a self-administered questionnaire about sexual behavior was included. DNA from oral brushing was purified to amplify HPV-DNA through MY09/MY11 and GP5+/GP6+ primers and subsequently subjected to sequencing. Conditional regression models were built to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Sixty two cases and 248 controls (53.2% males), median age 62 years (Q1-Q3 = 54-72 years) were included. HPV prevalence was 43.5% in cases and 17.3% in controls (HR-HPV: 37.1% cases, 9.7% controls). The most frequent types in cases were HPV-16 and HPV-18 (55.6 and 18.5%). The presence of HR-HPV was associated with OSCC (OR = 6.2; 95% CI: 2.98-12.97) controlling for the most common risk factors. An interaction between smoking and drinking was detected, and family history of cancer was also significant (OR: 3.61; 95% CI = 1.44-8.99). Early age at first sexual intercourse and large number of lifetime sexual partners showed an association with HR-HPV (p = 0.019 and p = 0.033, respectively). Conclusions: Oral HR-HPV was strongly associated with OSCC, suggesting that HPV-16 and -18 are risk factors for oral cancer in Mexican patients. A significant association of tobacco and alcohol was confirmed. In addition, family history of cancer was associated with OSCC. The results underline the role of HPV in OSCC and its multifactorial etiology. © 2008 IMSS.";Alcohol | Human papillomavirus | Mexico | Oral cancer | Tobacco;98;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This process is characterized by an increase in morbidity, a diminished independence and adaptability, deterioration of socio-familiar models, retirement from work, a decrease in the socio-economic capacity and psychophysical restriction. The importance in this population is pointed out regarding chronic and degenerative diseases, whose longer duration implies more expensive therapies and medicines associated to longer periods of hospitalization. The prevalence in substance consumption at this stage of life is pronounced towards medical drugs, but not to psychotropics of abuse. However, many abuse/dependency and self-medication problems are promoted. After the exposition on the physiopathology of old age, and its relation with ethanol consumption, drugs of medical use and psycho-drugs, some participant factors in the physiological changes, the multiple pathology and poly-pharmacy are discussed, indicating with didactic interest the Adverse Reaction to Medicines and the recommendations to follow for their suitable prescription.

The first part of this work thus presents the main antecedents for the changes made during the last two decades of the last century and analyses the current situation since the start of the new millennium. Such analysis is centred on an initial evaluation of the Seguro Popular de Salud's scope and limitations from the perspective of equity in gaining access to medical attention. The analysis concludes that due to a medical perspective not having been present in the structural reforms, then this insurance policy represents a discretional, presidential and focalised programme taking funds away from the large social security institutions, obligating them (in many cases) to make budgetary adaptations to the detriment of providing quality attention. This situation will constitute (in the immediate future) a segmentation of the National Health System which will determine new conditions regarding the population's differential access to medical services, increase inequity in health and contribute towards increasing the great social inequality prevailing in México.";Access | Equity | Medical attention | Sanitary reform | Social security (source: MeSH.

These tasks depend among other factors, of the relation between the magnitude of the crackle and the background lung sound. In this work, we explore multivariate signal processing to deal with the tasks and propose a new concept, the discontinuous adventitious sounds imaging. The image formation is founded on the results of two proposed methodologies that use an autoregressive (AR) model. In the first case, the AR coefficients feed an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify temporal acoustic information as healthy or sick and; in the second case, a time-variant AR (TVAR) model, obtained by the RLS algorithm, permits to detect changes in the TVAR coefficients to be associated with the number of crackles. For AR-ANN, the ratio of the temporal windows classified as sick to the classified as healthy is used as an index to form the adventitious image, while for TVAR-RLS, an estimation of the number of crackles is obtained to form the corresponding image. The results indicated that fine and coarse crackles could be detected and counted even with very low crackle magnitude so that the formation of a crackle distribution image was consistent. © 2008 IEEE.";;2;0;;;;undefined;

This work compares RATHI with clinical pulmonary auscultation (PA) to assess the concordance between both procedures to detect asymmetries in lung sound (LS) intensities. Twelve healthy young males participated in the study and were auscultated by two experts. RATHI consisted in the acquisition of acoustical signals with an array of 5×5 sensors, while experts auscultated and described the intensity of LS heard using the same stethoscope on each sensor's position within the array. Comparisons were established looking for intensity asymmetries between apical vs. basal pulmonary regions and right vs. left hemithorax. By RATHI, most of the subjects showed asymmetries between apical and basal regions higher than 20%, whereas between left and right hemithorax asymmetries higher than 20% occurred only half of the time. RATHI and PA agreed 83 to 100% when apical to base acoustical information was compared, but when left to right asymmetries were considered these figures were about 40 to 50%. We concluded that RATHI has advantages as it gave more detailed and measurable information on LS than clinicians, who could not detect intensity asymmetries mainly below 20%. © 2008 IEEE.;;6;0;;;;undefined;

Consequently, due to the difficulty for their characterization, the selection of an adequate time-frequency representation (TFR) for the analysis of their time-frequency dynamics is important. Traditionally, normal and abnormal lung sounds have been analyzed by the Spectrogram (SP). However, this analysis tool has certain disadvantages when one deals with nonstationary signals. As an effort to point out the appropriate analysis tool for crackles, this paper shows the performance of the Hilbert-Huang spectrum (HHS) for the analysis of fine and coarse crackles, simulated and real ones. The HHS allowed to analyze the evolving time-frequency of crackle sounds straightforward with good resolution compared with SP. Beside this enhanced time-frequency course, HHS could be useful to establish a signature to detect and separate fine from coarse crackles in order to screen pathologies and their progress during medication. © 2008 IEEE.;;22;0;;;;undefined;

However, few attempts have tried to analyze the sound where crackles are immersed. In this work base lung sounds (BLS) were analyzed by linear and nonlinear techniques to And possible differences between normal subjects and patients with diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In both groups, segments of lung sounds (crackles absent) and segments of BLS (lung sound in between crackles) were analyzed from acquired lung sounds from four points at the posterior chest, two apical and two basal. In this study, 8 healthy subjects and 8 patients participated and BLS were analyzed by spectral percentiles and sample entropy. Although spectral percentiles and sample entropy (SampEn) tended to be lower in the group of patients, statistical differences (p<0.05) between normal subjects and patients were found in BLS at the left hemithorax at basal and apical regions, while at the right hemithorax significant differences were found only at the basal region using the nonlinear technique. We conclude that in respect to normal subjects, BLS of patients with diffuse interstitial pneumonia present differences as assessed by SampEn, so that BLS by itself provides useful information. Moreover, it seems that nonlinear technique did a better discrimination of abnormal BLS than spectral percentile parameters. © 2008 IEEE.;;3;0;;;;undefined;

As a consequence, in the current work intrasubject variability of RATHI is evaluated at different airflows. For generating RATHIs, LS were acquired at the posterior thoracic surface. The associated image was computed at the inspiratory phases by interpolation through a Hermite function. The acoustic information of eleven subjects was considered at airflows of 1.0,1.5 and 2.0 L/s. Several RATHIs were generated for each subject according to the number of acquired inspiratory phases. Quadratic mutual information based on Cauchy-Schwartz inequality (I cs) was used to evaluate the degree of similitude between intrasubject RATHIs. The results indicated that, for the same subject, I cs averaged 0.893, 0.897, and 0.902, for airflows of 1.0, 1.5, and 2 L/s, respectively. In addition, when the airflow was increased, increments in intensity values and in the dispersion of the spatial distribution reflected in RATHI were observed. In conclusion, since the intrasubject variability of RATHI was low for airflows between 1.0 and 2.0 L/s, the pattern of sound distribution during airflow variations is repeatable but differences in sound intensity should be considered. © 2008 IEEE.;;5;0;;;;undefined;

In this work we tested Time-Frequency Representation (TFR) for simulated S2 selecting and applying classical and modern TFRs such as the Spectrogram, the Wigner-Ville Distribution, the Time Varying Autoregressive (TVAR) model, the Scalogram, and the Hilbert-Huang Spectrum (HHS) by Empirical Mode Decomposition. Two performance measures are proposed, the first one based on local 2D correlations (ρ) between the ideal and the estimated TFRs images, while the second one based on time moments of the TFR images to provide the normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE). Under no noise conditions, the TFRs by HHS and the TVAR modeling, by the Burg algorithm, resulted in a ρaverage of 0.788 and 0.812, and NRMSE of 0.172 and 0.195, respectively. Therefore, based on the lowest NRMSE, HHS was considered the TFR with the best performance. Afterward, HHS was applied to real S2 acquired at the aortic and pulmonary focal points. © 2008 IEEE.;;3;0;;;;undefined;

The purpose of this work was to explore the capacity of the time-variant autoregressive (TVAR) model to detect and to provide an estimate number of fine and coarse crackles in lung sounds. Thus, simulated crackles inserted in normal lung sounds and real lung sounds containing adventitious sounds were processed with TVAR and by an expert that based crackle detection on time-expanded waveform-analysis. The coefficients of the TVAR were obtained by an adaptive filtering prediction scheme. The adaptive filter used the recursive least squares algorithm with a forgetting factor of 0.97 and the model order was four. TVAR model showed an efficiency to detect crackles over 90% even with crackles overlapping and amplitudes as low as 1.5 of the standard deviation of background lung sounds, where expert presented an efficiency around 30%. In conclusion, TVAR model is a proper alternative to detect and to provide an estimate number of fine and coarse crackles, even in presence of crackles overlapping and crackles with low amplitude, conditions where crackles detection based on time-expanded waveform-analysis reveals evident limitations. © 2008 IEEE.";;8;0;;;;undefined;

The specialized production on systematics produced and published in local journals was notable and remained stable after the 80's, mainly in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. The contents have been published primarily in Spanish and mainly in the form of articles. They dealt mostly with descriptive taxonomy and were related to ecology, anatomy, histology and aquatic biology. The most represented groups were insects and angiosperms.

A previous screening showed high trypanocidal activity in the extracts of these species. Several mammea-type coumarins, triterpenoids and biflavonoids were isolated from the leaves of C. brasiliense. Mammea A/AA was obtained from the fruit peels of M. americana. These compounds were tested in vitro against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease. The most potent compounds were mammea A/BA, A/BB, A/AA, A/BD and B/BA, with MC 100 values in the range of 15 to 90 μg/ml. Coumarins with a cyclized γ,γ-dimethylallyl substituent on C-6, such as mammea B/BA, cyclo F + B/BB cyclo F, and isomammeigin, showed MC100 values > 200 μg/ml. Several active coumarins were also tested against normal human lymphocytes in vitro, which showed that mammea A/AA and A/BA were not toxic. Other compounds from C. brasiliense, such as the triterpenoids, friedelin, canophyllol, the biflavonoid amentoflavone, and protocatechuic and shikimic acids, were inactive against the epimastigotes. The isopropylidenedioxy derivative of shikimic acid was inactive, and its structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction.

To determine the relative risk (RR) of non-fatal unintentional and violence-related injury associated with alcohol consumption in three emergency departments in Latin America (2001-2002). Material and Methods. Pair-matched case-crossover was used to obtain RR estimates for alcohol in non-fatal injuries among 447 patients in Argentina (A), 489 in Brazil (B) and 455 in Mexico (M). Intentional (violence) or unintentional (non-violence) injury status were the main outcomes Results. About 46% of violence-related cases involved alcohol (versus 11.5% for non-violence related cases). The risk of violence-related injury increased with drinking and had an OR= 15.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 5.8-39.1), with an OR= 4.2 (CI= 2.7-6.5) for unintentional injuries. Conclusions. Increasing amounts of drinking may have pronounced consequences on the risk of triggering an injury, especially for a violence-related injury.

The article is based on extensive fieldwork in Mexico City (May-September 2005) which consisted of 29 in-depth interviews with highly skilled Spanish professionals. The article concludes that these migrants establish relations with places of proximity, even if this does not necessarily imply a clear sense of belonging, and regardless, these geographical links only partially explain these Spaniards intentions to stay in Mexico. © 2008 by the Latin American Studies Association.;;9;0;;;;undefined;

METHOD: Data are presented from the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey, a representative household survey of 3,005 adolescents ages 12 to 17 in metropolitan Mexico City who were gathered in 2005, regarding lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of suicide ideation, plan, and attempt and demographic and psychiatric disorders risk factors. RESULTS: Lifetime ideation was reported by 11.5% of respondents, whereas 3.9% reported a lifetime plan and 3.1% a lifetime suicide attempt. Onset of suicidality started around age 10 and at age 15 showed the highest hazards. Suicide ideators were more likely to report a plan and attempt within the first year of onset of ideation. Suicidality was more likely to occur among females. The presence of one or more mental disorders was strongly related to suicide ideation, plan, and attempt. Among ideators only dysthymia was consistently related to a plan and attempt. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention efforts should focus on assessment and target adolescents with mental disorders, particularly mood disorders, to be effective in prevention.

Methods: A total of 5001 NCS respondents were re-interviewed (87.6% of baseline sample) in the NCS-2. Three sets of baseline (NCS) risk factors were considered as predictors of the first onset and persistence of SROs: socio-demographics, lifetime DSM-III-R disorders, and SROs. Results: New onsets included 6.2% suicide ideation, 2.3% plan, 0.7% gesture, and 0.9% attempts. More than one-third of respondents with a baseline history of suicide ideation continued to have suicide ideation at some time over the intervening decade. Persistence was lower for other SROs. The strongest predictors of later SROs were baseline SROs. Prospective associations of baseline mental disorders with later SROs were largely limited to the onset and persistence of ideation. Limitations: Although data were gathered prospectively, they were based on retrospective reports at both baseline and follow-up. Conclusions: Baseline history of SROs explained much of the association of mental disorders with later SROs. It is important clinically to note that many of the risk factors known to predict onset of SROs also predict persistence of SROs. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Most of these studies have use non-simultaneous recording and input sounds introduced at the mouth or other thoracic points. In this paper, we present acoustic thoracic images, for transmitted glottal sounds, formed by a multichannel system with an array of 5×5 microphones. The study was done using 4 healthy subjects and 4 subjects having diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In both groups of subjects, it was found that the thorax behaves as a lowpass filter depending on the physical properties of its components, and that the transmitted acoustic thoracic imaging (TATHI) could reflect such properties. In most of the healthy subjects right to left asymmetries and heterogeneous apical to basal distribution were found. In patients the lateral dominance was lost and an intensity increment in the frequency band of 300 to 600 Hz was revealed. We conclude that TATHI permits to observe easily the spatial extension of the disease through sound transmission. ©2007 IEEE.;;8;0;;;;undefined;

We present a new approach to segmentation of brain image volumes using DLML (Data List Management Library), a tool developed by our team. We organise the integer numbers identifying images into a list, and our DLML version process them both in parallel and with dynamic load balancing transparently to the programmer.

The approach is based on the technology used for the RatCAP conscious small animal PET tomograph which utilizes block detectors consisting of pixelated arrays of LSO crystals read out with matching arrays of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and a custom-designed ASIC. A version of the detector is being developed that will be constructed out of all non-magnetic materials that can be operated inside the MRI field. We have demonstrated that the PET detector works inside the MRI field using 511 keV gamma rays, and have obtained MRI images with various detector components that show minimal distortion in the MRI image. We plan to improve on the image quality in the future using completely non-magnetic components and by tuning the MRI pulse sequences. The combined result will be a highly compact, low mass PET scanner that can operate inside an MRI magnet without distorting the MRI image, and can be retrofitted into existing MRI instruments. © 2006 IEEE.;;9;0;;;;undefined;

Finding an adequate treatment for this pathology is an important goal in medicine. The purpose of the present research was to investigate the effect of an extract from Aloe vera gel containing a high concentration of polyphenols on experimentally induced insulin resistance in mice. A polyphenol-rich Aloe vera extract (350 mg/kg) with known concentrations of aloin (181.7 mg/g) and aloe-emodin (3.6 mg/g) was administered orally for a period of 4 weeks to insulin resistant ICR mice. Pioglitazone (50 mg/kg) and bi-distilled water were used as positive and negative controls respectively. Body weight, food intake, and plasma concentrations of insulin and glucose were measured and insulin tolerance tests were performed. The insulin resistance value was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) formula. Results showed that the polyphenol-rich extract from Aloe vera was able to decrease significantly both body weight (p < 0.008) and blood glucose levels (p < 0.005) and to protect animals against unfavorable results on HOMA-IR, which was observed in the negative control group. The highest glucose levels during the insulin tolerance curve test were in the negative control group when compared to the Aloe vera extract and pioglitazone treated mice (p < 0.05). In conclusion, Aloe vera gel could be effective for the control of insulin resistance. © 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company: Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.;Aloe vera Gel | Aloe-Emodin | Aloin | Insulin Resistance | Medicinal Plants;67;0;;;;undefined;

Due to scarce information of lymphocyte function in these injuries it is important to know TCD4+ and TCD8+ subpopulations to explain chronic inflammatory processes. Objective: To identify TCD4+ and TCD8+ lymphocyte phenotype populations in humane mycetomas, by fluorescent monoclonal antibodies (FITC or fluorescein, anti-TCD4+) and RPE or R-phycoerythrin (anti-TCD8+). Material and methods: Histological cuts in biopsies of five patients diagnosed as with actinomycetoma, two due to Nocardia brasilensis, one due to Actinomadura madurae, one due to Madurella mycetomatis, and one due to Acremonium, respectively, with a mean of five years of development. Two cuts of each sample were performed, one used to hematoxilin-eosin stain and one for human immunofluoresence study, both diluted in a 1:100 PBS-gelatin solution. Results:In actinomycetomas 85% were TCD4+ lymphocytes and 15% were TCD8+. In eumicetoma injuries, 81% were TCD4+ and 19% were TCD8+. Generally, in mycetomas 83% were TCD4 and 17% were TCD8. Conclusion: Acute inflammatory process of mycetoma, with an abundant neutrophil presence, could be due to IFN-γ secreted by CD4+ (Th1) and TCD8+ cells in these injuries. Regulation of IFN-γ synthesis will depend on regulatory cytokines levels from CD4+ (Th2).;Actinomycetoma | Eumycetome | Immunofluorescence | Mycetoma | T lymphocyte subpopulation;5;0;;;;undefined;

During adolescence these opportunities increase. Because of the scarcity of data for the Mexican population, the aim is to estimate the prevalence of drug use opportunities among Mexican adolescents, the prevalence of drug use among those who were presented with the opportunity, and the socio-demographic correlates of both. A multistage probability survey was carried out among 12-17 year olds from Mexico City. Adolescents were administered the adolescent version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The response rate was 71% (n = 3005). Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were performed considering the multistage and weighted sample design. Twenty-nine percent has had the opportunity to try illicit drugs; of those presented with an opportunity, 18% has done so. Males, older adolescents, school drop-outs, and those whose parent has had drug problems are more likely to have been exposed to drug use opportunities while more religious adolescents are less likely. Given the chance to try drugs, older adolescents and school drop-outs are more likely to do so and those with high parental monitoring and religiosity are less likely. These results suggest that less substance use among females in Mexico may be due in part to fewer opportunities to use since females were equally likely to use drugs given the opportunity.

The effect of the zeolite Zcu (clinoptilolite and mordenite) on the production of vegetal biomass and the chemical properties of the soil was studied, employing oat as an indicative crop. Five concentrations of Zcu in soil were evaluated (0, 5, 10, 20 y 30 % dried weight of soil) plus an additional treatment with Z CUalone. Aerial and root biomass, pH and cation-exchange capacity (CEC), NH4+ in the substrate and lixiviated NO 3-1 were evaluated. The application of Zcu had a positive effect on the production of aerial and root biomass, and also modified the soil chemical environment (pH and CEC). The application of ZCU produced a lower accumulation of leached NO3- in relation to the amount of NH4+ in the substrate. The results show that ZCU has the capacity to adsorb ammonium and reduce the nitrification process.;;9;0;;;;undefined;

Grains from theses plants were analyzed for protein content and grain yield. The 29 lines with highest protein and the 23 lines with highest grain yield were selected and evaluated. Frequency distribution for the 637 plants tended to be normal for protein content, with an average of 13.6% (10.9-16.8%; variance of 1.0). The evaluation of the lines showed that, with irradiation and selection for grain size and weight, the grain protein content and yield increased. The line with highest protein exceeded Salamanca by 19.8% and Romaga by 21.8%. The line with highest yield exceeded these varieties in 45.3 and 35.8%, respectively.

We describe mental health care in 17 countries participating in the WHO world mental health (WMH) survey initiative and examine unmet needs for treatment. Methods: Face-to-face household surveys were undertaken with 84 850 community adult respondents in low-income or middle-income (Colombia, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, China, South Africa, Ukraine) and high-income countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, USA). Prevalence and severity of mental disorders over 12 months, and mental health service use, were assessed with the WMH composite international diagnostic interview. Logistic regression analysis was used to study sociodemographic predictors of receiving any 12-month services. Findings: The number of respondents using any 12-month mental health services (57 [2%; Nigeria] to 1477 [18%; USA]) was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of gross domestic product spent on health care. Although seriousness of disorder was related to service use, only five (11%; China) to 46 (61%; Belgium) of patients with severe disorders received any care in the previous year. General medical sectors were the largest sources of mental health services. For respondents initiating treatments, 152 (70%; Germany) to 129 (95%; Italy) received any follow-up care, and one (10%; Nigeria) to 113 (42%; France) received treatments meeting minimum standards for adequacy. Patients who were male, married, less-educated, and at the extremes of age or income were treated less. Interpretation: Unmet needs for mental health treatment are pervasive and especially concerning in less-developed countries. Alleviation of these unmet needs will require expansion and optimum allocation of treatment resources. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients with locally confined PC are treated with either radiotherapy or surgery. However, treatment of more advanced stages of the disease is problematic. Initially, androgen deprivation offers a period of clinical stability, which is however invariably followed by progression to non-responsiveness to hormonal manipulation. Current management of patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) displays modest response rates and achieves only short-term benefit. Recently, knowledge in the complex pathophysiology of advanced PC has led to the identification of mechanisms and target molecules permitting the introduction of new therapies. Consequently, many investigational treatments are ongoing for AIPC in Phase-II and Phase-III trials aiming at the combination of chemotherapeutic regimens along with immunotherapy targeting PC-associated antigens. Other attractive options are gene therapy, as well as the targeting of survival signaling, differentiation, and apoptosis of the malignant PC cells. Further treatment modalities are directed against the tumor microenvironment, bone metastasis, or both. Collectively, the aforementioned efforts introduce a new era in the management of advanced PC. Novel pharmaceutical compounds and innovative approaches, integrated into the concept of individualized therapy will hopefully, during the next decade, improve the outcome and survival for hundreds of thousands of men worldwide. © Humana Press Inc. 2007.;Advanced-stages | Molecular therapy | Prostate cancer;14;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Objectives: To evaluate the association between long-term exposure to ozone (O3), particulate matter less than 10 μm in diameter(PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and lung function growth in Mexico City schoolchildren. Methods:A dynamic cohort of 3,170 children aged 8 years at baseline was followed from April 23, 1996, through May 19, 1999. The children attended 39 randomly selected elementary schools located near 10 air quality monitoring stations and were visited every 6 months. Statistical analyses were performed using general linear mixed models. Measurements and Main Results: After adjusting for acute exposure and other potential confounding factors, deficits in FVC and FEV1 growth over the 3-year follow-up period were significantly associated with exposure to O3, PM10, and NO2. In multipollutant models, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in mean O 3 concentration (IQR, 11.3 ppb) was associated with an annual deficit in FEV1 of 12 ml in girls and 4ml in boys, an IQR range (IQR, 36.4 μg/m3) increase in PM10 with an annual deficit in FEV1 of 11 ml in girls and 15 ml in boys, and an IQR range (IQR, 12.0 ppb) increase in NO2 with an annual deficit in FEV1 of 30 ml in girls and 25 ml in boys. Conclusions: We conclude that long-term exposure to O3, PM10, and NO2 is associated with a deficit in FVC and FEV1 growth among schoolchildren living in Mexico City.;Air pollution | Children | Lung function growth;182;0;;;;undefined;

Method: A multi-stage probability survey of adolescents aged 12-17 years residing in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area was carried out in 2005. Adolescents were administered the computer-assisted adolescent version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview by trained lay interviewers in their homes. The response rate was 71% (n = 3005). Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were performed considering the multi-stage and weighted sample design of the survey. Findings: Of the adolescents, 5.2% have ever tried illicit drugs, 2.9% in the last 12 months. The most frequently used drugs are marijuana, followed by tranquilizers/stimulants. The median age of first use is 14 years. Correlates of life-time drug use are older age, having dropped out of school, parental drug problems, low religiosity and low parental monitoring. Conclusions: While drug use among Mexican adolescents is lower than among adolescents from other developed countries, its increasing prevalence with age and the narrowing male/female ratio calls for firm public health actions, particularly prevention strategies. © 2007 The Authors.;Epidemiology | Illicit substance use | Mexico | Youth;45;0;;;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

In order to discern its quality, the sediment was characterized during two seasons (dry and rainy periods) and three zones of the river (right margin, center and left margin). The seasons and river zones were selected in order to find spatial and temporal variations. To integrate all these parameters and to evaluate the sediment quality based on these two metals, a sediment quality index (ICS) was created. The ICS results showed a better environmental quality during the dry season, due to a lower sediment re-suspension than in the rainy and dredging season. The ICS results showed similar results to the lnfaunal Trophic Index, explaining 65% of the spatial and temporal variability of the aquatic ecosystem. Considering that no similar indexes to the one presented in this study exist, the ICS is considered as an effective tool for sediment quality evaluation at the study area. © 2007 Asociación Interciencia.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

Because hypoalphalipoproteinemia is highly prevalent in Mexico, we screened the ABCA1 coding sequence in Mexican individuals with low and high HDL cholesterol levels to seek functional variants. A highly frequent nonsynonymous variant (R230C) was identified in low-HDL cholesterol but not in high-HDL cholesterol individuals (P = 0.00006). We thus assessed its frequency in the Mexican-Mestizo general population, seeking possible associations with several metabolic traits. R230C was screened in 429 Mexican Mestizos using Taqman assays, and it was found in 20.1% of these individuals. The variant was significantly associated not only with decreased HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels but also with obesity (odds ratio 2.527, P = 0.005), the metabolic syndrome (1.893, P = 0.0007), and type 2 diabetes (4.527, P = 0.003). All of these associations remained significant after adjusting for admixture (P = 0.011, P = 0.001, and P = 0.006, respectively). This is the first study reporting the association of an ABCA1 variant with obesity and obesity-related comorbidities as being epidemiologically relevant in the Mexican population. © 2007 by the American Diabetes Association.;;93;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Furthermore, this specific bioassay allows for the identification of more than one single siderophore-producing microorganism at the same time, using an overlay technique in which a modified CAS medium is cast upon culture agar plates (thus its name ""O-CAS"", for overlaid CAS). Detection was optimized through adjustments to the medium's composition and a quantifying strategy. Specificity of the bioassay was tested on microorganisms known for siderophore production. As a result, a total of 48 microorganisms were isolated from three different types of samples (fresh water, salt water, and alkaline soil), of which 36 were determined as siderophore producers. The compounds identified through this method belonged to both hydroxamate and catechol-types, previously reported to cause color change of the CAS medium from blue to orange and purple, respectively. Some isolated microorganisms, however, caused a color change that differed from previous descriptions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This method provides a scaling or fractal exponent αx derived from the behaviour of the root-mean-square fluctuations along different time scales n. Rather than just finding a single exponent, covering either short (α1) or long range (α2), we recently suggested tracking the local evolution of αx, as in this way scaling patterns (SP), which seem to provide more detailed characterizations of HRV data, are revealed. Here, we evaluate such potential advantage by classifying long-term data from 51 subjects in normal sinus rhythm and 29 congestive heart failure patients. Using the SP we achieved a significantly better classification of these data than using αx, or the statistic pNN20, thereby confirming that the SP provide a useful assessment of the correlation structure in HRV data. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.;Detrended fluctuation analysis | Heart rate variability | Power-law | Scaling behaviour | αβ filter;21;0;;;;undefined;

Methods: In a sample of 1366 subjects from 7 to 24-years-old, a self-administered questionnaire was used to determined demographic characteristics. The definition of pediatric MS was determined using analogous criteria to Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) as ≥ 3 of the following: concentration of triglycerides ≥ 100 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol < 45 mg/dL for males and < 50 mg/dL for females, waist circumference ≥ 75th percentile (sex specific), glucose concentration ≥ 110 to < 126 mg/dL, and systolic or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90th percentile (age, height, and sex specific). Results: Most of the sample was in the 10-14- (32.4%) and the 15-19-year (35.4%) age groups, mostly females (57%), and 31% of this young sample was overweight (mean BMI = 21.6 kg/m2). About 1 in every 5 participants had full criteria for MS (19.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.4-22.1 among females, and 20.2%, 95% CI: 17.1-23.7 among males), and only 1 in every 10 was free of any MS component. The most common component was a low HDL level, observed in 85.4% of the sample. Unfavorable fat distribution, as indicated by a large waist circumference, was present in 27.9% of the sample. About 66% of those 10-14-year-olds with a large BMI were positive for MS. Conclusions: MS and overweight are major problems for youth in Mexico. Immediate and comprehensive actions at home and schools are needed if Mexico wants to avoid the heavy burden that this disorder will have for its population in the near future. © 2007 Society for Adolescent Medicine.;Adolescence | Metabolic syndrome | Overweight;65;0;;;IMSS;undefined;Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social

This virus is also detected in about 20% of all head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. While there is strong evidence for a causal etiological role in the case of tonsillar carcinomas, causal association with malignant lesions of the oral cavity is not yet conclusive. Our previous investigations of HPV-16 DNA methylation in anogenital sites have identified hypermethylation of the L1 gene and part of the long control region in many malignant lesions, but rarely in asymptomatic infections and low-grade precancerous lesions. Here, we report hypermethylation of this diagnostically important segment of the viral DNA in 10 out of 12 HPV-16 positive oral carcinomas from Mexican patients. These data indicate epigenetic changes of HPV-16 in oral carcinomas similar to those in anogenital carcinomas, suggesting carcinogenic processes under the influence of HPV-16 in most if not all of these oral malignant lesions. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;Carcinoma | DNA methylation | DNA recombination | Etiology | Head and neck cancer | HPV-16 | Oral cavity | Papillomavirus | Progression;43;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;NCI;R01CA091964;National Cancer Institute

Statistically significant odds ratios (2.9-3.1) were found between 12-month smoking and 12-month suicidal behaviors. However, the associations of smoking with the outcomes became insignificant with controls for DSM-IV mental disorders. Although clear adjudication among contending hypotheses about causal mechanisms cannot be made from the cross-sectional NCS-R data, the results make it clear that future research on smoking and suicidal behaviors should focus more centrally than previous research on mental disorders either as common causes, markers, or mediators. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.;Epidemiology | Mental disorders | Mental health | Nicotine | Smoking | Suicidal ideation | Suicide attempts | Suicide plans;61;0;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

The latter was carried out through a random design. The livestock system was classified as agrosilvopastoral, characterized by its access to a variety of different ecological areas (crop, fallow lands and pine-oak forest). Thirteen multi-purpose woody fodder species were identified and ranked by farmers: Acacia angustissima, A. pennatula, Casimiroa edulis, Diphysa robinoides, Ficus cookii, Leucaena brachycarpa, Litsea glaucescens, Lysiloma auritum, Pistacia mexicana, Quercus crispipilis, Q. segoviensis, Rhus schiedeana and Tecoma stans. Ten uses and 43 products or services were identified for fuelwood (11), living fences (9), shade (9), medicinal purposes (7), tools (3), food (2), and condiment, charcoal, tanning and ornamental use (1 of each). The best ranked species by producers according to fodder availability during the dry season, palatability, livestock fattening and propagation were A. angustissima, C. edulis, L. brachycarpa, L. auritum y P. mexicana. Chemical analysis, in vitro digestibility and secondary compounds of 13 species showed significant variation among species. Crude protein content was 8.1-22.7% and total phenols 5.4-8.4%. Alkaloids showed low-medium values. The palatability test (p<0.05) showed that the most consumed species (g/ms/animai -1) were A. angustissima (69.48), L. auritum (54.85) and A. pennatula (35.69).";Agrosilvopastoral systems | Chiapas | Fallow | Secondary compounds;16;0;;;;undefined;

A literature search was conducted on the period during which the last educational reform was implemented in Mexico. The discourse analysis focused on the ethnography of communication, which identified: the various actors' positions, arguments, actions, economic and political power, and relations to others. The results show that those who oppose the inclusion of these themes in the school curriculum base their position on tradition, contrary to modernization and secularization of social life, and that their positions range from refusal to raising conditions. Networks have been formed that provide such groups with significant economic and political power. Government has given in to some demands by partially modifying the textbook contents.

We examined the association between substance use disorders and migration to the United States in a nationally representative sample of the Mexican population. Methods. We used the World Mental Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview to conduct structured, computer-assisted, face-to-face interviews with a cross-sectional sample of household residents aged 18 to 65 years who lived in Mexico in cities with a population of at least 2500 people in 2001 and 2002. The response rate was 76.6%, with 5826 respondents interviewed. Results. Respondents who had migrated to the United States and respondents who had family members who migrated in the United States were more likely to have used alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine at least once in their lifetime; to develop a substance use disorder; and to have a current (in the past 12 months) substance use disorder than were other Mexicans.

We studied failure and delay in making initial treatment contact after the first onset of a mental or substance use disorder in Mexico as a first step to understanding barriers to providing effective treatment in Mexico. Methods. Data were from the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey (2001-2002), a representative, face-to-face household survey of urban residents aged 18 to 65 years. The age of onset for disorders was compared with the age of first professional treatment contact for each lifetime disorder (as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition). Results. Many people with lifetime disorders eventually made treatment contact, although the proportions varied for mood (69.9%), anxiety (53.2%), and substance use (22.1%) disorders. Delays were long: 10 years for substance use disorders, 14 years for mood disorders, and 30 years for anxiety disorders. Failure and delay in making initial treatment contact were associated with earlier ages of disorder onset and being in older cohorts. Conclusions. Failure to make prompt initial treatment contact is an important reason explaining why there are unmet needs for mental health care in Mexico. Meeting these needs will likely require expansion and optimal allocation of resources as well as other interventions.;;56;0;repositoryvor;Green;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

As a result, the impact of mental disorders was underestimated until the last two decades of the previous century. This perception began to change as a result of two factors: On the one hand, the study of the Global Burden of Disease reported by Murray and Lopez, and, on the other hand, the definition of mental disorders by the American Psychiatric Association. The common element shared by these two factors is the inclusion of the concept of disability. Disability is the deterioration of the expected functioning of a subject of a particular age and sex in a social context. It is a part of the social cost of illness. Objective: To assess the disability burden associated with depression, mania, agoraphobia, social phobia, general anxiety, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) according to the Mexican Psychiatric Survey and to compare results with the disability produced by some chronic non-psychiatric conditions. Method: This survey is based on a stratified, multistage area, probabilistic sample of adults living in urban areas of Mexico. The instrument used was the third version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. We report the 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorders as defined by DSM-IV criteria. We also evaluated non-psychiatric chronic conditions like diabetes, arthritis, hypertension, backache, and other painful illnesses, identified in general as ""chronic conditions"". Indicators of disability were Sheehan's scale and number of work days lost. This is an easy and fast self reporting scale, which can be used both in the clinic or research. The sub-scales can be added or averaged to obtain a total score. The scale of responses is a horizontal line with numerals from 0 to 10 and five verbal descriptions, with the description ""Not at all"" corresponding to a value of 0; ""Mild"" rangimg from 1 to 3; ""Moderate"" from 4 to 6; ""Severe"" from 7 to 9; and ""Very severe"" corresponding to 10. Results: Close relationships and social life were the areas most deeply affected. The disorders found to produce the highest levels of disability were depression, social phobia, and PTSD. The lowest disability levels were observed in chronic conditions. On the total score of Sheehan's scale, disorders with the highest level of disability were PTSD (mean 5.35 ± 0.307) and depression (mean 4.72 ± 0.167). Depression and panic attacks were the disorders by which most days were lost on average in the previous year (25.51, CI95:16.53-34.5; 20, CI 95: 3.02-36.97). Days lost were lower in chronic conditions than in the seven mental disorders studied (6.89, CI95: 3.04-10.74). Discussion: This is the first paper to demonstrate the impact of mental disorders in Latin America evaluating the association of disability with common mental disorders. We have shown that mental disorders, especially depression, are associated with deficits in functioning and result in the loss of work days. We have also shown that persons with common mental disorders have, on average, higher levels of disability than those observed among persons with a wide range of chronic physical conditions. These results are consistent with prior studies in North America and Europe that have found that persons with common mental disorders experience substantial disability in social role functioning.";Depression | Disability | Lost days | Mental disorders | Social cost;16;0;;;;undefined;

Oat straw, bean straw, corn stubble, apple pomace and agave bagasse were treated using two filamentous fungi, Trichoderma harzianum and Phanaerochaete chrysosporium. Chemical analyses (crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) were carried out. Calibrated glass syringes were used for in vitro gas production determinations and volatile fatty acid (VFA) profile was obtained by gas chromatography. In vitro data were fitted using the equations p=a+b(l-e-ct) by Ørskov and McDonald and G=A/(1+[B/t]) by France et al (2000). Increases in CP content (P<0.05) were registered by treating oat straw (20%), bean straw (83%) and corn stubble (16%) with P. chrysosporium. Contents of NDF were reduced by 9.5% in oat straw by treatments (P<0.05). Regarding gas production parameters, the b value in agave bagasse (57.4%) and gas production rate constant c (7.5%) were higher (P<0.05) in the substrate treated with P. chrysosporium related to other treatments. Similarly, higher values for the A parameter were registered in maize straw (+22%) and agave bagasse (+13%) treated with P. chrysosporium. In spite of these isolated differences, the analysis performed showed that the chemical composition, mainly structural carbohydrates, were not modified under the conditions of this study.;In vitro gas production | Phanaerochaete chrysosporium | Trichoderma harzianum;9;0;;;;undefined;

(Caesalpiniaceae) (TpPs). Gas chromatography analysis of a hydrolyzed sample confirmed the main chain of (1→4)-β-D-glucan, containing glucose, xylose, and galactose. TpPs was assayed in febrile rats and Balb/c mice. Pyrexia was induced in rats by subcutaneous yeast injection, and in mice with an intraperitoneal injection of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli. Animals were treated with different oral TpPs doses (5-100 mg/kg). A significant dose-dependent reduction of the rectal temperature was observed. We also analyzed the effect on cytokines response to in vitro TpPs treatment in peritoneal exudates cells (PECs), as well as in response to LPS cell stimulation. IL-1β and IL-6 cytokines were measured in the supernatants through ELISA assays. Cells treated with LPS (10 μg/mL) or TpPs (100 μg/mL) alone resulted in a significant release of IL-1β. Our results indicate that, depending upon the experimental conditions, TpPs (0.005-0.5 μg/mL) abolished the IL-1β response to LPS cell stimulation, but at higher doses (50-100 μg/mL) increased it, and reduced significantly the IL-6 response. In febrile rats and Balb/c mice, TpPs did prevent fever in a dose-dependent manner. These preliminary findings show an in vitro modulating effect by TpPs in IL-1β profile at the local immune cellular level, and both febrifuge and hypothermic responses in a mouse model. © 2007 Informa Healthcare.;Fever | Interleukin-1β | Interleukin-6 | Polysaccharide | Pulp | Tamarindus indica Linn. | Xyloglucan;3;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Clinical judgments about the likelihood of suicide attempt would be aided by an index of risk factors that could be quickly assessed in diverse settings. We sought to develop such a risk index for 12-month suicide attempts among suicide ideators. Method. The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a household survey of adults aged 18+, assessed the 12-month occurrence of suicide ideation, plans and attempts in a subsample of 5692 respondents. Retrospectively assessed correlates include history of prior suicidality, sociodemographics, parental psychopathology and 12-month DSM-IV disorders. Results. Twelve-month prevalence estimates of suicide ideation, plans and attempts are 2.6, 0.7 and 0.4% respectively. Although ideators with a plan are more likely to make an attempt (31.9%) than those without a plan (9.6%), 43% of attempts were described as unplanned. History of prior attempts is the strongest correlate of 12-month attempts. Other significant correlates include shorter duration of ideation, presence of a suicide plan, and several sociodemographic and parental psychopathology variables. Twelve-month disorders are not powerful correlates. A four-category summary index of correlates is strongly related to attempts among ideators [area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)=0.88]. The distribution (conditional probability of attempt) of the risk index is: 19.0% very low (0.0%), 51.1% low (3.5%), 16.2% intermediate (21.3%), and 13.7% high (78.1%). Two-thirds (67.1%) of attempts were made by ideators in the high-risk category. Conclusions. A short, preliminary risk index based on retrospectively reported responses to fully structured questions is strongly correlated with 12-month suicide attempts among ideators, with a high concentration of attempts among high-risk ideators. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.;;188;0;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

This method provides a scaling or fractal exponent a derived from the behaviour of the root-mean-square fluctuations along different time scales n. Rather than just finding a single exponent, covering either short or long range, we recently suggested to track the local evolution of α as in this way scaling patterns (SP), which seem to provide more detailed characterisations of HRV data, are revealed. Here, we evaluate such potential advantage by classifying long-term data from 50 subjects in normal sinus rhythm and 29 congestive heart failure patients. Using the SP we achieved a significantly better classification of these data than using α, thereby confirming that the SP provide a useful assessment of the correlation structure in HRV data.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

Early studies involved the collection of acoustic information at several positions on the thoracic surface or at the extra-thoracic trachea with one up to four microphones, but with a non-simultaneous acquisition. However, an increment for simultaneous acquisition points has been suggested; for example, as a consequence of multichannel acquisition acoustic visualization through computerized interpolation has emerged being helpful to analyze lung sounds (LS) origin, distribution, and relation to ventilation. Nevertheless, quantitative analysis of lung sounds requires eliminating interference signals prior to the extraction of relevant features. The acquired signals not only contain LS but also heart sounds (HS) among other interferences. HS are unavoidable and sometimes represent severe disturbing interference. This paper proposes a HS cancellation scheme as an extension of a previous effort using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and a combination of time warping with linear adaptive FIR filtering. Simulated signals are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme under known and controlled scenarios. © 2006 IEEE.";;8;0;;;;undefined;

These fungi begin their infective process when spores are retained on the integument surface, where the formation of the germinative tube initiates, the fungi starting to excrete enzymes such as proteases, chitinases, quitobiases, Upases and lipoxygenases. These enzymes degrade the insect's cuticle and help in the process of penetration by mechanical pressure that is initiated by the apresorium, a specialized structure formed in the germinative tube. Once inside the insect, the fungi develop as hyphal bodies that disseminate through the haemocele and invade diverse muscle tissues, fatty bodies, Malpighian tubes, mitochondria and haemocytes, leading to death of the insect 3 to 14 days after infection. Once the insect dies and many of the nutrients are exhausted, fungi start micelar growth and invade all the organs of the host. Finally, hyphae penetrate the cuticle from the interior of the insect and emerge at the surface, where they initiate spore formation under appropriate environmental conditions. © 2007 Asociación Interciencia.;;7;0;;;;undefined;

For this purpose, two experiments were done, in the first experiment 30 heifers were divided into two groups of fifteen animals each, the supplemented group (GS) showed an initial weight of 365.27 ± 24.40 kg, received commercial concentrate to the ratio of 1 % of live weight (5.5% PC 2.85 Meal ED) and the control group which was not supplemented (GNS) with an initial weight of 367.47 ± 31.65 kg. In the second study 45 heifers were divided in two groups, the GSb with 22 animals having an initial weight of 342.23 ± 36.4 kg and given concentrate to the rate of 1% of live weight (13% PC 3.5 Meal ED) and the GNSb were made up of 23 animals having an initial average weight of 326.0 ± 31.3 kg. In both trials the animals were supplemented throughout for forty-five days and let them grazed on African Star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis), Candelario grass (Pennisteum purpureum) and Ratana grass (Ischaemum indicum). In both experiments no differences were observed (P > 0.05) in weight change The GS had daily weight gains (GDP) of 0.27 kg/d while the GNS showed losses of -0.05 kg/d. In the second trial the GSb showed a GDP of 0.90 kg/d and the GNSb of 0.60 kg/d. The predicted GDP of the first experiment was similar in comparison with the observed value for the supplemented group (P > 0.05), in contrast with that presented in the GNS group in which the daily weight gain was over estimated (P < 0.05). In the second trial the GDP predicted for both groups was under estimated (P < 0.05). The level 1 of the NRC simulation model does not seem to be appropriate for predicting changes in weight in heifers under tropical conditions.;Bos indicus | Grazing | NRC | Simulation | Supplement;1;0;;;;undefined;

In this study, we evaluate the existence of short-range fractal-like correlations in fetal RR fluctuations data from the second half of human gestation. Methods: Fifty-six short-term abdominal ECG recordings were obtained from low-middle-risk pregnant women. Gestational age varied from estimated 21 weeks to term. For comparison, RR-interval data of 51 healthy adults were also analysed. Results: Principal findings along the gestational period explored were the existence of fractal RR dynamics in prenatal fetal data as revealed by the short-range scaling exponent α1. No significant differences of α1 (p = 0.4770) were found between fetal (median 1.2879) and adult data (median 1.3214), either between the fetal cases before or after 24 weeks (p = 0.6116) despite observing more variation at early stages. However, fetal RR data did involve lower magnitude in comparison with adults as we found significant differences in pNN20 and SDNN values. Conclusion: The fetal short-range fractal behaviour of RR data could then be linked to the functional development of the parasympathetic activity, which appears to become manifested before 21 weeks of gestation.

At 28 days of the assay, eggs were collected from each treatment to evaluate physical quality at 0, 15 and 30 days of storage at 4 and 20°C. A factorial design of 5×3×2 was used. There were no statistical differences in performance parameters (P>0.05). Average egg weight was higher (64.08g) with 15% SBM, without any detectable effect due to storage time. Haugh Units (HU) decreased in eggs stored at 20°C (15 and 30 days), but not at 4°C. Yolk color was reduced in treatments with SBM as compared with the control and was also altered by storage time at 20°C. Eggshell weight was not affected by storage conditions or by the treatments. No differences (P>0.05) in eggshell thickness and sensorial evaluation (yolk color and taste) were found.

It is characterized by systemic and oral cavity alterations. Depending on the timing of lesions, GVHD is classified as acute or chronic. Alterations in the oral cavity are lichenoid reticular lesions, erythema, ulcerations, and xerostomia. Sporadically, mucocele and pyogenic granulomas can be present. Aim: To describe GVHD oral manifestations in eight allogenic BMT patients, and discuss GVHD and drug-immunosuppresion associated lesions diagnosis and treatment. Study design: For a year, we examined the oral mucosa of eight consecutive allogenic BMT patients attending the Dermatology outpatient clinic at the Institute Nacional de Cancerología (National Institute of Oncology) in Mexico City, looking for oral mucosa lesions. Results: Patients were five men and three women, ages 24.8 ± 9.7 years. Four had a BMT because of chronic granulocytic-, two for acute myeloblastic-, one for acute lymphoblastic- leukemia, and one for aplastic anemia. Three patients developed acute GVHD, with reticular oral mucosa lesions, erythema and mucositis; and all eight developed chronic GVHD, with reticular oral lesions, erythema, and ulcerations. A Patient had tongue and cheek pyogenic granulomas. Six reported xerostomia. Other oral lesions, associated to drug- immunosuppression, were candidiasis and herpes simplex. Conclusions: Patients with GVHD frequently develop oral lesions, some of which interfere with normal feeding; timely diagnosis and treatment are therefore essential to improve the quality of life of affected patients. We propose an alternative treatment for pyogenic granulomas. © Medicina Oral S.L.";Bone marrow transplantation | Candidiasis | Graft-versus-host disease | Pyogenic granulomas | Xerostomia;10;0;;;;undefined;

Material and Methods. The data come from a study of 663 women, randomly selected from a framework sample of 21 421 homes in Mexico City. This work collects information about factors that affect utilization of health services, as well as predisposing factors (age and socioeconomic level), as enabling factors (education, social support, entitlement, pay out of pocket and opinion of health services), and need factors. The sample was ranked according to exclusion variables into three stratums. The data were analyzed through the technique of path analysis. Results. The results indicate that socioeconomic level takes part like predisposed variable for utilization of prenatal care services into three stratums. Otherwise, education and social support were the most important enabling variables for utilization of prenatal care services in the same three groups. In regard to low stratum, the most important enabling variables were education and entitlement. For high stratum the principal enabling variables were pay out of pocket and social support. The medium stratum shows atypical behavior which it was difficult to explain and understand. There was not mediating role with need variable in three models. This indicated absence of equality in all stratums. However, the most correlations in high stratum perhaps indicate less inequitable conditions regarding other stratums.;Access to services health | Inequality | Mexico | Prenatal care | Social support | Socioeconomic factors;12;0;;;;undefined;

Subjects: A sample of 1092 men and 1247 women, apparently healthy, aged 20-69, was studied. Methods: Participants were asked to identify the silhouette that most accurately represented his/her body size. Weight and height were measured in duplicate to calculate BMI. A simple linear regression analysis was used to adjust BMI values to silhouette categories by gender. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated to assess accuracy. Results: Gender-specific BMI values for each silhouette were obtained. Correlation coefficients between silhouette ratings and BMI were 0.702 in males and 0.766 in females. Overweight ranged from silhouette 4 to 6 and obesity from silhouette 6 to 9, in both men and women. In the regression models, 49.3% of BMI variance in males and 58.7% in females were explained statistically by silhouette self-selection. AUC were higher than 0.8 for overweight and obesity in males and females. Conclusions: Both male and female models had a good fit, indicating that BMI can be associated with body shape silhouettes. Silhouettes can be useful for defining overweight and obesity in settings such as schools or worksites, or where scales and stadiometers might not be available. They can also be used to provide health advice to the public. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.;Adults | Body image | Body mass index | Body size | Mexican | Obesity | Silhouettes;29;0;;;;undefined;

The contribution of both researchers were different: Warren, pathologist, observed the bacterium in the inflamed gastric tissue and ascribed it as causal agent. Also, he identified the bacterium in the inflamed tissue of the gastric and duodenal ulcer. The use of silver staining and electron-microscopy contributed to identify the bacterium. Marshall, gastroenterologist, obtained the bacterium culture by the use of a suitable nutritious media. To fulfil the Koch's postulates he self-inoculated by oral ingestion of a Helicobacter culture resulting en acute gastritis that cured by antibiotics. Also, he planned clinical assays to achieve efficient eradication regimes. He discovered the rapid urease test with gastric biopsies (CLO-test) and the 14C-urea breath test for the diagnosis. The Hp discovery, criticized at the beginning and non-accepted by the most, inspired and stimulated to many others to research on the injuries of the gastroduodenal mucosa related to Hp infection. In fact, epidemiological studies showed 20-80% prevalence of Hp in healthy people, variable in relationship to economic, social and hygienic levels. In patients with gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric carcinoma and lymphoma the infection achieved 80-90%. Consequently, their diagnosis included the histology, culture, urease, urea breath test and others.

Three indicators of body image perception were created: body dissatisfaction, body size perception and body image distortion. Results: A greater percentage of women were found that wants to change their body and does something to change it, whereas more men did not want to change nothing of their body. For both sexes, the main reasons for changes were to feel well and by health concern. The men consume more animal origin foods and the women prefer fruits and vegetables. More men make the double of the recommendation of physical activity than women. Among men preference for animal food and dairy products increased according the desire of increase body weight.

To date, molecular genetic studies in several families affected with AD have identified three genes associated with highly penetrant early-onset AD: Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and β-amyloid precursor protein (APP); and one gene (apolipoprotein E) associated with late-onset AD. Molecular analysis of the PSEN1 gene was performed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. The possible founder effect was investigated analyzing two highly polymorphic microsatellite markers flanking the PSEN1 gene. Twelve unrelated Mexican families with early-onset AD were analyzed. The Ala431Glu mutation in exon 12 of PSEN1 was found in nine (75%) of these families, which segregated showing autosomal dominant inheritance. Because all families bearing the mutation are from the State of Jalisco (located in Western Mexico), a founder effect was hypothesized. Microsatellite haplotype analysis suggested a common ancestor in these nine kindreds. In conclusion, the Ala431Glu mutation is a prevalent cause of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease in families from the State of Jalisco, Mexico.

Design: The case-crossover method was used to obtain RR estimates of the effect of alcohol on non-fatal injuries. Meta-analysis was used to evaluate the consistency and magnitude of RR across sites, and the extent to which contextual variables explain differences in effect sizes. Participants: Probability samples of 11 536 injured patients attending 28 EDs studies in 16 countries (1984-2002). The majority of the sample was male (65%) and > 30 years old (53%). Measurements: Exposed cases where those that consumed alcohol 6 hours prior to the injury. Usual alcohol consumption served as the control period. Findings: Drinking within 6 hours prior to the injury was reported by 21% of the sample. The estimated (random) pooled relative risk for patients who reported alcohol use within 6 hours prior to injury was 5.69 (95% confidence interval = 4.04-8.00), ranging from 1.05 in Canada to 35.00 in South Africa. Effect size was not homogeneous across studies, as societies with riskier consumption patterns had a higher relative risk for injury. Heavier drinkers also showed lower RR. Conclusions: Acute alcohol was a risk factor for non-fatal injuries in most sites. Policy measures addressed to the general population are recommended, especially in societies with riskier consumption patterns. © 2006 Society for the Study of Addiction.;Alcohol use | Case-crossover | Emergency department | Epidemiology | Risk;55;0;;;NIAAA;P50AA005595;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

Hierarchical linear modeling is used to analyze the relationships of the volume of alcohol consumed prior to injury and feeling drunk at the time of the event with causal attribution, as well as the association of aggregate individual-level and socio-cultural variables on these relationships. Data analyzed are from 1955 ER patients who reported drinking prior to injury included in 35 ERs from 24 studies covering 15 countries from the combined Emergency Room Collaborative Alcohol Analysis Project (ERCAAP) and the WHO Collaborative Study on Alcohol and Injuries. Half of those patients drinking prior to injury attributed a causal association of their injury with alcohol consumption, but the rate of causal attribution varied significantly across studies. When controlling for gender and age, the volume of alcohol consumed and feeling drunk (controlling for volume) were both significantly predictive of attribution and this did not vary across studies. Those who drink at least weekly were less likely to attribute causality at a low volume level, but more likely at high volume levels than less frequent drinkers. Attribution of causality was also less likely at low volume levels in those societies with low detrimental drinking patterns, but more likely at high volume levels or when feeling drunk compared to societies with high detrimental drinking patterns. These findings have important implications for brief intervention in the ER if motivation to change drinking behavior is greater among those attributing a causal association of their drinking with injury. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ovarian function was assessed in the transplanted ovary after stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin (100 IU). Exfoliative vaginal cytology was done, serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) were measure, and a histological study of ovaries and uteri was done. Late vascular permeability was 73.3%. Serum E2 and P4 levels during the poststimulation period were extremely low exclusively in group III (P < .05). In all viable grafts, the histological study showed follicular development and presence of luteal bodies. In the uteri, the endometrium was proliferative and vaginal cytology showed the karyopicnotic index was >20%. Endocrine function and ovulation were restored in the heterotopic transplanted ovary.

In addition, to search for possible adverse effects after treatment, the measurement of some biochemical, haematological and physiological parameters were also analysed. Eighteen crossbred heifers were divided into six groups of three animals each. Groups 1-5 received a single oral dose of 12, 36, 60, 120 and 180 mg/kg of body weight (bw) of compound alpha. Group 6 served as an untreated control. To determine the biochemical, haematological and enzymatic parameters, sera and blood samples were individually taken at 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, and 720 h after treatment. Physiological parameters such as rectal temperature, heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and ruminal motility were measured at the time intervals mentioned above. Estimation of the MTD and SI was obtained by using the formula reported by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the results showing an MTD of 180 mg/kg/bw and an SI of 15 times the recommended clinical dose. Some statistical differences were observed in a few of the biochemical, haematological and enzymatic parameters, the adverse effects being not highly representative. Alterations on HR and RR were statistically different (P < 0.05) only in heifers treated with 180 mg. © 2006 The Authors.;;4;0;;;;undefined;

Moreover, the short-range fractal or scaling exponent α1 extracted from these correlations has been found to be a predictor of mortality for subjects with an impaired left ventricular function. In general, the RR-interval data required for this analysis are derived from long-term ECG recordings during free-running conditions. Yet short-term recordings are more likely to be obtained in some practical circumstances, so becoming relevant to assess the possibility of obtaining representative α1 exponents from these recordings. Here, we compare the α1 exponents extracted from the RR-interval series (9:00 am-6:00 pm) of 51 healthy adults in normal sinus rhythm and the α1 calculated from three shorted segments of only 700 beats obtained from the same series at 9:00 am, 1:30 pm and 5:00 pm. We found no significant differences between the scaling exponents derived from the whole 9 h series and the short segments at 9:00 am and 5:00 pm, but did find significant differences when comparing the whole series with the short segment at 1:30 pm. Thus, only if the time of day is taken into consideration can short segments of heartbeat fluctuation data be used to obtain representative α1 exponents. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.;Circadian rhythm | Detrended fluctuation analysis | Heart rate variability | Power law;9;0;;;;undefined;

Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that an apparently identical senescent state can also be prematurely induced in vitro in different cell types following sublethal oxidative stress stimuli. The former suggests a molecular link between cell cycle regulation and cell survival that could involve regulatory proteins such as Bcl-2. There is strong evidence that, in addition to its well-known effects on apoptosis, Bcl-2 is involved in antioxidant protection and regulation of cell cycle progression. The aim of this work was to determine if the protection against oxidative stress mediated by Bcl-2 could prevent or delay oxidative stress-induced senescence. Using a retroviral infection system, Bcl-2 was overexpressed in primary, nonembryonic mice fibroblasts obtained from lungs derived from 2-month-old CD1 mice. Fibroblasts overexpressing Bcl-2 were exposed to 75 μM H2O2 for 2 h to induce SIPS. The rate of proliferation and the increment of senescent cells were then determined. Our results indicate that overexpression of Bcl-2 protected primary fibroblasts against oxidative stress-mediated reduction in cell proliferation, but did not prevent premature senescence. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

A significant decline in occurrence and mortality from cervical cancer in developed countries has been associated with the application of organized cervical screening programs. The use of the available local health methods in cervical cancer screening can be adjusted in different countries. This review discusses the recent results in traditional and alternative cervical cancer screening. Recent findings: The current recommendations of both the American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concerning clinical practice guidelines for cervical cancer screening are commented upon. New methods and new technology for cervical cancer screening are described. Attributable failure factors in the screening process, particularly in the coverage, are analyzed. A critical assessment of the suitability of local cervical cancer screening resources is discussed. Summary: Screening is clearly a complex multifactorial process, not a test. Nowadays, with the human papillomavirus vaccine on the horizon, screening is the best strategy for cervical cancer control. Good screening programs, with high coverage, quality control and follow-up included, are the basis of obtaining better results. The Papanicolaou test and its variants are the best methods of cervical cancer screening in high-resource settings. Alternative visual inspection using cervical dyes could be the most useful method in low-resource settings. The challenge for the future may be less of a technical nature and more dependent on local finances and screening policies. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.;Alternative and traditional methods | Cervical cancer screening;24;0;;;;undefined;

To date, surgery is the mainstay of treatment. However, patients with mandibular osteosarcomas usually have a locally advanced disease at diagnosis and therefore represent a therapeutic challenge because surgical margins are difficult to obtain due to aesthetic and functional concerns. To evaluate possible prognostic factors implicated in recurrence, persistence or relapse in osteosarcoma of the mandible, with special reference to the soft tissue and bone surgical margins. A series of 20 patients with mandibular osteosarcomas treated at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología (México) from 1985 to 1999 are reviewed. There were 14 female and 6 male patients. Twelve cases were treated with surgery alone, 3 patients with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, 1 had neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery, 1 had neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and postoperative radiotherapy, 1 with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, 1 with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy and one patient rejected treatment. Between 1985 and 1992 these neoplasms were treated by means of total mandibulectomy, independently of tumor size, but between 1993 and 1999 the policy was to practice smaller resections but long enough to obtain macroscopic surgical free margins. In the first period the relationship between mandibular size resection and tumor size was 1.9, meanwhile in the second period the relation was 1.5. There was not significant difference between both periods in terms of tumor size (6.0 cm vs. 6.02 cm at the time of surgery) nor in local control and survival. Soft tissue involvement as reported by histological study was strongly associated with recurrence (p = 0.0024). Overall 5-year survival was 20%. A policy of total mandibulectomy is not associated with a better local control or survival. Extent of resection must be tailored with tumor size. Extent of margins in soft tissue is the limiting factor for local control. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;Head and neck | Jaws | Osteosarcoma | Surgical margins;30;0;;;;undefined;

Several resistance systems have been directly characterized by genetic and biochemical tests, whereas other may only be inferred by comparison with the systems encoded in the genomes of other bacteria. This review briefly summarizes the mechanisms of resistance to heavy metals in pseudomonads. For this purpose, metals have been divided into three groups: (i) micronutrient cations that show toxicity (copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc); (ii) nonessential toxic cations (cadmium, lead, mercury, siliver); and (iii) toxic oxyanions (derived from arsenic, chromium, selenium and tellurium). Pseudomonads have evolved two main strategies to cope with heavy metal toxicity: membrane transporters able to efflux toxic ions from the cytoplasm, which include members of the major membrane protein families, and enzymatic redox detoxification pathways, which transform metals to less-toxic forms. Most heavy metal resistance systems in pseudomonads are encoded by complex operons, located on chromosomes or on plasmids, commonly involving delicate regulatory switches functioning at the transcriptional level. The abundance and diversity of genetic determinants conferring metal tolerance in the genomes of pseudomonads may be associated with the varied environments that these versatile bacteria inhabit.";Efflux systems | Metal detoxification | Metal resistance | Metal toxicity;9;0;;;;undefined;

The quality of the class boundaries is improved by including an edge confidence map, that represents the confidence of truly being in the presence of a border between adjacent regions; an adjacency graph is then constructed with the labeled regions, and analyzed and pruned to merge adjacent regions. In order to assign image regions to a cerebral tissue type, a spatial normalization between image data and standard probability maps is carried out, so that for each structure a maximum a posteriori probability criterion is applied. The method was applied to synthetic and real images, keeping all parameters constant throughout the process for each type of data. The combination of region segmentation and edge detection proved to be a robust technique, as adequate clusters were automatically identified, regardless of the noise level and bias. In a comparison with reference segmentations, average Tanimoto indexes of 0.90-0.99 were obtained for synthetic data and of 0.59-0.99 for real data, considering gray matter, white matter, and background. © 2006, IEE.";A priori tissue information | Brain magnetic resonance imaging | Cerebral tissue | Data-driven brain MRI segmentation | Edge confidence map | Edge detection | Nonparametric density estimation | Region segmentation | Standard probability maps | Tanimoto indexes;89;0;;;;41203;

Lower r values were obtained at higher noise levels; this effect was more critical for the F signal. Noise sources caused different distortion; e.g. at 0.8 level and 50 averaged beats, r remained high for breathing (0.996 A, 0.995 N, 0.972 F); lower for electromyography (0.990 A, 0.972 N, 0.905 F), and even lower for power-line (0.931 A, 0.852 N, 0.574 F).

In addition, corporal and breathing fetal movements were simultaneously observed using ultrasound B mode images. High frequency components of fetal HRV data were obtained by applying the EMD and by reconstructing the signals from components having frequencies higher than 0.3 Hz, according to the lowest frequency of fetal breathing movements observed in our data. Our results show significant differences in the power of high frequency components for episodes only with breathing movements vs no movements and vs. episodes having corporal movements (p < 0.05).

This paper describes the 12-month prevalence, severity and demographic correlates of 16 DSM-IV psychiatric disorders and service utilization in the Mexican urban population aged 18-65 years of age. This is representative of 75% of the national adult population. Method. The sample design was a strict probability selection scheme. The response rate was 76.6%. The World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was installed on laptops and administered by lay interviewers. An international WHO task force carried out its translation into Spanish. Results. The 12-month prevalence of any disorder was 12.1%. The most common disorders were specific phobia (4.0%), major depressive disorder (3.7%) and alcohol abuse or dependence (2.2%). The 12-month prevalence of very severe disorders was 3.7% of which only 24% used any services. Age was the only variable associated with any 12-month disorder, with the younger more likely to report any disorder. Income was associated with severity, with low and low-average incomes more likely to report a 12-month disorder. Females were more likely to report a mood and anxiety disorder, but less likely to report a substance disorder. The group of separated/widowed/divorced was more likely to report a mood and an impulse-control disorder. Conclusions. The results show that while psychiatric disorders are common in the Mexican population, very severe mental disorders are less common and there is extreme under-utilization of mental health services. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.;;161;0;;;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

To evaluate the association between invasive Cervical Cancer (CC) and high risk Human Papilloma Virus (HR-HPV) (viral load and type 16), along with other gynecological and socioeconomic factors.Material and Methods. Individually matched case-control study (215 women with invasive CC and 420 controls). The study population was recruited between 2000 and 2001. A set of variables traditionally linked with CC (gynecological and socioeconomic factors) and two variables related to HPV infection (viral load and type 16) were assessed. Hybrid Capture II was used to detect HR-HPV DNA. Viral load was measured by light measurements expressed as relative light units (RLU) and they were categorized for analysis into four groups: negative (<1 RLU), low viral load (1-49 RLU), middle load (50-499 RLU) and high load (>499 RLU). The analysis included univariate, bivariate and multivariate techniques being the final step the estimation of Odds Ratios (OR) by means of conditional logistic regression models. Results. The probability of having invasive CC was 78 times higher in patients with infection of HR-HPV. Risk increases with HPV type 16 (OR=429.7) as compared with other types of HR-HPV (OR=64.1). An important trend was observed with the increase of the viral load (from 46.6 with low viral load; to 250.7 with intermediate and 612.9 with high load). The findings also indicate significant diferences in the viral load between cases and controls according to age groups and HR-HPV types (16 versus others high risk types). Finally, the partner-demographic and obstetrical variables related to the disease increased the risk of invasive CC. No association between CC and smoking was observed in this population. Conclusions. This study helps in identifying women at higher risk of developing invasive CC as a subset of those patients infected with HR-HPV. The findings point strongly to the importance of the viral load in HR-HPV as a cofactor in the development of this disease. This biomarker contributes to improving the prevention and early detection of this disease and also to identify women at higher risk who carry a high viral load of HR-HPV.";Cervix neoplasms | Human papillomavirus | Mexico | Risk factors | Viral load;21;0;;;;undefined;

Frequently, information provided on their labels conflicts with published data on active ingredients, use concentrations, or exposure times. Objective: To evaluate sporicidal activity in 8 chemical products sold for the sterilization or high-level disinfection of medical and dental instruments. Methods: Bacillus atrophaeus ATCC 9372 spores were suspended (106 spores in 50 mL) in each of 4 glutaraldehyde solutions: a super oxidized solution, a hydrogen peroxide formulation, a quaternary ammonium compound, and an ortho-phthalaldehyde solution. After up to a 10-hour exposure, the solutions were passed through 0.22-μm filters, which were then rinsed with 1% sodium bisulfite, washed, and incubated on tryptic soy agar for 5 days at 37°C. Results: At the use concentrations stipulated on their labels, only 2 of 6 products registered as sterilants showed sporicidal activity when challenged with 6 log10: a 2% glutaraldehyde in 10 hours and the hydrogen peroxide solution in 6 hours. Of 2 products registered as high-level disinfectants, only the ortho-phthalaldehyde showed noticeable sporicidal activity after 10-hour exposure. Conclusion: The results show that some chemical products, commercially available in Mexico as ""Liquid Chemical Sterilants/High-Level Disinfectants"" cannot be used reliably to process instruments between patients.

Multiple abnormalities in the immune response, including cytokine production, in protein energy-malnourished children have been described and could account for the increased severity and frequency of infections. In this study, we used flow cytometry to investigate the effects of malnutrition on the production of cytokines (interleukin-2 [IL-2], gamma interferon [IFN-γ], IL-4, and IL-10) in CD4+ and CD8+ cells and the activation capability (as indicated by CD69+ and CD25+ cells). CD4+ and CD8+ cells from malnourished children showed increased production of IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines and decreased production of IL-2 and IFN-γ cytokines compared to that in cells from well-nourished, uninfected and well-nourished, infected children. In addition, malnourished children showed impaired activation capability, since the fluorescence intensity of CD69 + and CD25+ cells was lower than that in cells from well-nourished, uninfected and well-nourished, infected children. These results indicate that malnutrition alters the capacity of CD4+ and CD8 +cells to produce IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10 in response to stimulus. We concluded that both cytokine production and activation capacity were impaired in malnourished children. This functional impairment may be involved in the failure to develop a specific immune response and the predisposition to infection in these children.

In Mexico, scorpion envenomation is considered a public health problem. Despite the frequency of scorpion sting cases, there are to date no uniform criteria for their treatment. In Mexican traditional medicine, different plant species have been widely used as a remedy for treating scorpion poisoning. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of Bouvardia ternifolia, Aristolochia elegans and Vitex mollis extracts on Centruroides limpidus limpidus venom lethality in mice, and to determine their antagonist activity on guinea pig ileum. The hexane and methanol extract from B. ternifolia modified the LD50 of C. limpidus limpidus venom from 0.750±0.08 to 1.64±0.19 and 1.16±0.14 mg/kg, respectively. The extracts of A. elegans produced lower antitoxic activity, while extracts of V. mollis did not show any protection. On in vitro test, addition of B. ternifolia and A. elegans extracts strongly inhibited, in a concentration- dependent manner, the ileum contractions induced by venom. In general, the results demonstrated the effectiveness of these two plant species in modifying the lethality of C. limpidus limpidus venom in mice. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

The aim of the present study was to characterize expression of the Fos protein by immunocytochemistry in the rabbit's SCN under two conditions: light-dark (L/D, 12:12 h, lights on at 7:00 a.m.) every four hours, starting at ZT01 (08:00 h geographical time) and constant darkness (D/D), starting at CT03. We also analyzed the induction of Fos in the SCN in response to a light pulse (850 lux/30 min) at CT03, CT11, CT15 and CT19 in D/D conditions. In L/D there was a clear Fos induction by light at ZT01 and ZT05 (p < 0.01) in comparison to the other time points. In D/D we found an endogenous rhythm of Fos that peaked at CT07 (p < 0.01). Light pulses induced a strong Fos immunoreactivity only during the subjective night at CT15 and CT19, in the ventrolateral region of the SCN (p < 0.05), in contrast to the maximum expression of Fos during L/D and D/D, where only a sparse distribution in the nucleus was found. In conclusion, we found a daily and a circadian rhythm of Fos and a photic induction at times that produce phase-shifts in other species. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.;Circadian rhythms | Fos | Immunocytochemistry | Rabbit | Suprachiasmatic nucleus;6;0;;;NIH;R01 TW006636-01;National Institutes of Health

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the ti-me required for diagnosis, the lesion's locoregional extent and the therapeutic schemes applied, in a retrospective series of 58 patients with CeCa and with lumbar spinal metastases. METHODS: The cases were studied using an updated interdisciplinary analysis to determine the clinical and radiological variables. This study evaluated the site and extent of bone lesions and correlated these variables with instability of the spine and cord compression. RESULTS: The diagnosis of vertebrae metastases of Ce-Ca required more than 3 months in most cases.Lumbar vertebrae L4 and L5 and specifically the vertebral body were the most-frequently affected si-tes. Systemic and/or extra-compartmental-extended metastases (MosV4) were observed in 44/58 patients. Radiotherapy was the only option in this group and the palliative effect achieved was minimal, or null. In 14/58 patients there was intra compartmental-extended (MosV2) and extra-compartmental limited (MosV3) single vertebral metastases and the 3 different treatment schemes were administered. In the cases treated with marginal resection of metastases, vertebroplasty plus adjuvant radiotherapy achieved significant palliative effect. CONCLUSIONS: In the present series of patients, the diagnosis of metastases of the lumbar vertebrae was late, and the disease was advanced. The results obtained with radiotherapy in advanced stage disease did not improve the quality of life of patients. Metastasectomy was the therapeutic scheme in cases with intermediate stage disease and was the basis of the integrated treatment We believe that it is necessary to shorten the diagnostic time and to apply a staging system for vertebral metastases so that appropriate individualised selection of interdisciplinary treatment would be facilitated.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

This study is aimed at describing the social determinants of knowledge related to cervical uterine cancer and proper testing being conducted by establishing the social differences with regard thereto among a population of female employees at a public university in Mexico. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was made. During the March-April 2003 period, a survey was conducted of a representative sample of the female employees who were working at a public university (n=228), 110 of whom were professors (PF) and 118 administrative staff (AS). This population was chosen due to the major socioeconomic differentiation thereof in terms of their job positions (PF versus AS), thus affording the possibility of evaluating the bearing social inequality has on health-related behavior. The survey explored three aspects: living conditions, knowledge of CUC and of proper cervical uterine cancer detection testing. Results: The female professors showed higher levels of income, schooling and knowledge of CUC and of cervical uterine cancer detection testing than the administrative staff. Income and schooling were positively related to the knowledge regarding cervical uterine cancer, cervical uterine cancer detection testing being related to the latter. Conclusions: Socioeconomic inequality among the women studied was reflected in differences in the degree of knowledge and in cervical uterine cancer detection testing being undergone. These differences are associated, above all, to the differences in the level of schooling.;Cervical cancer | Inequalities | Life style | Social conditions | Socioeconomic factors | Socioeconomic level;3;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Prevalence of tolerance was also higher in those countries with high detrimental drinking pattern scores. Sensitivity of the RAPS4-QF for heavy drinking was uniformly high across countries, while maintaining good specificity, and did not vary by detrimental drinking patterns.

Methods: Data are from the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey (M-NCS). This population survey was carried out in 2001-2003 in a sample of 5,782 respondents of 18 years and older. Onset of ideation, a plan, and suicide attempt, as well as psychiatric and service use correlates were estimated using survival analysis. Results: Of the respondents, 8.3% reported lifetime ideation, 3.2% reported a lifetime plan and 2.8% reported lifetime suicide attempt(s). The prevalence for 12-month suicidal behaviors was 2.3%, 1.0% and 0.6%, respectively. Suicidal behaviors were more prevalent in early adolescence and early adulthood and became less common after the mid-thirties, with the exception of suicidal ideation that continues into older ages. Having met criteria for one or more of the DSM-IV disorders assessed in the survey was common among suicide ideators (60.9%), planners (75.6%) and attempters (74.6%), and was a strong risk factor for suicidal behaviors, with odds ratios of 4.8 for ideation, 10.2 for plan and 9.6 for attempt. Approximately one of every four lifetime attempters reported to have ever seen a psychiatrist. Conclusions: As in many other countries, mental disorders have an important impact on suicidal behaviors in Mexico. Intervention efforts aimed at identifying and treating persons at or before the onset of suicidal ideation is strongly recommended.;Epidemiology | Psychiatric disorder | Risk factors | Suicide | Suicide attempt | Survey;14;0;;;;undefined;

Remodelling involves a complex network of cell-cell signalling involving systemic hormones, locally produced cytokines, growth factors and the mechanical environment of the cells. Here, we report on the effect of mechanically-induced strain on the synthesis by mouse calvarial osteoblasts in monolayer culture of IL-10 and IL-12, two cytokines that inhibit osteoclast formation in bone marrow cultures; IL-10 also suppresses osteoblast differentiation suggesting a role for both cytokines in bone physiology. A tensile strain was applied to the cells intermittently for 6 s, every 90 s, for 2-96 h. After 2-h culture, supernatants from deformed cells contained significantly less IL-10 than control cultures. In contrast, mechanical deformation had a stimulatory effect on IL-12 synthesis; however, by 48 h both had returned to control levels. These data suggest that IL-10 and IL-12 can be added to the growing list of mechanical stress-responsive genes. The down-regulation of IL-10 and stimulation of IL-12 further suggests that the initial response of the cells to mechanical deformation was an osteogenic one. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

While an association between cigarette smoking and depression has been established in Anglo populations, replication of tobacco-depression associations in countries where smoking is growing may provide important new insights. The objectives of this study were to estimate the association of depressive symptomatology with tobacco smoking, number of cigarettes smoked daily, and smoking cessation in a representative sample of the Mexican population. Method. The data come from the Third National Addictions Survey (1998) conducted by the Mexican Ministry of Health, representative of Mexico's civilian population residing in cities and towns with 2500+ inhabitants, aged 18-64. Part of a multi-stage, stratified, probability sample, 1935 men and women answered a version of the survey that also included the CES-D depression scale. Analyses addressed the survey's complex design and controlled for income and educational level. Results. Among women only, current smokers had twice the odds of elevated depressive symptomatology than never smokers (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.5, p=0.002). For men, only those smoking a pack or more a day had greater odds of depressive symptomatology (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.6-21.9, p=0.008). Overall, former smokers who ceased smoking within 6 months had lower odds of depressive symptomatology than current smokers (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.0, p=0.042). Conclusions. These findings add to the accumulating evidence for the association between smoking and depression in different cultures and populations. © 2004 Cambridge University Press.;;41;0;;;;undefined;

In this study, AR- and progesterone receptor (PR)-dependent transcriptional activation induced by norethisterone (NET), levonorgestrel (LNG) and gestodene (GSD), and their 5α-reduced derivatives, including limited trypsin digestion of AR in the presence of natural and synthetic progestins were investigated. The results confirmed the progestogenic activity of the three 19-nortestosterone derivatives, which decreases after reduction of the 4-ene-double bound. These compounds were able to activate AR-dependent reporter gene expression, LNG and GSD being the stronger activators. 5α-Reduction of LNG and GSD did not change their androgenic transcriptional activity; however, the activation of AR by 5α-NET was four-fold higher than NET. The highest selectivity transcriptional index, as a measure of progestogenicity versus androgenicity, was obtained for NET. The 5α-reduced derivatives had values significantly lower than those of their parent compounds. Non-reduced and 5α-reduced 19-nortestosterone progestins induced virtually identical proteolysis fragmentation patterns of the AR to those observed with DHT. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays, it is established that control of Candida albicans should be a consequence of suitable cellular responses, mainly TH1 subpobulations. On the other hand, considerably advances have been reached about the comprehension of the role of dendritic cells to dimorphic responses of these infections, demonstrating differential responses to protection in function of the receptors that have been activated. According to the role of the humoral responses to these illnesses, the existing evidences about the protective action of the antibodies are still uncertain.;Candida albicans | Cellular immunity | Cytokines | Dendritic cells | Humoral immunity | TH1-TH2 cells;1;0;;;;undefined;

A supplementary objective was to assess whether ethnic group, culture, level of deprivation or children's caries experience impact upon the relationships between oral health related behaviours, attitudes to these respective behaviours and to dental caries. Clinical setting: nurseries, health centres and dental clinics in 17 countries. Participants: 2822 children aged 3 to 4 years and their parents. Main outcome measures: Dental examination of children and questionnaire to parents. Results: factor analysis identified 8 coherent attitudes towards toothbrushing, sugar snacking and childhood caries. Attitudes were significantly different in families from deprived and non-deprived backgrounds and in families of children with and without caries. Parents' perception of their ability to control their children's toothbrushing and sugar snacking habits were the most significant predictors of whether or not favourable habits were reported. Some differences were found by site and ethnic group. Conclusions: this study supports the hypothesis that parental attitudes significantly impact on the establishment of habits favourable to oral health. An appreciation of the impact of cultural and ethnic diversity is important in understanding how parental attitudes to oral health vary. Further research should examine in a prospective intervention whether enhancing parenting skills is an effective route to preventing childhood caries.;Attitudes | Behaviour | Child | Dental health | Efficacy | Parent;159;0;;;NIDCR;R21DE013703;National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research

Groups of mice were immunized with formalin inactivated EPEC 0127:H6 strain by intranasal, peroral, intragastric and intrarectal route, with and without cholera toxin (CT) used as mucosal adjuvant. Mice immunized subcutaneously and a non treated control group were included. Other groups of mice were immunized intranasally with different EPEC strains and a non pathogenic E. coli K12 strain. Antibody response tested by ELISA assay showed that specific anti EPEC 0127:H6 antibodies were induced in serum by intra-nasal, subcutaneous and intragastric routes. A strong increase of antibody response against EPEC 0127:H6 strain was observed in saliva after intranasal delivery, while a lower response was detected by peroral and intrarectal immunization. Only the intranasal route increased IgA anti EPEC 0127:H6 antibody titers in feces. Specific and cross reactive antibodies to EPEC 0127:H6 were seen in mice immunized intranasally with different EPEC strains. Some control mice showed a background of anti EPEC 0127:H6 antibodies in feces. CT had a negative effect as adjuvant. We showed that nasal mucosa rendered the strongest antibody response in serum and secretions.

The variables in domains with no a priori algebraic or topological structure are objects whose similarity or difference is evaluated by comparison criteria functions. The range of these functions is an ordered set normalized into the unit interval, and they are designed to allow differentiation and non-uniform treatment of the object-variables. The analogy between objects is formalized as a similarity function that stresses the relations among the comparison criteria and evaluates the partial descriptions (partial similarity/difference) or total descriptions (total similarity/difference) of the objects. For the orthodontic problem we defined a set of 12 variables featuring the unilateral/bilateral fissures, the conditions of maxilla, premaxilla, mandible and patient's bite. The comparison criteria (logical for malocclusion, fuzzy for maxillary collapse unilateral/ anteroposterior and for overbite, and Boolean for protrusive/retrusive premaxilla conditions) were assigned a relevance factor based on the orthodontist accumulated knowledge and experience. The modeling of the similarity function and its effectiveness in comparing orthodontic conditions in patients are illustrated by the study of four clinical cases with different clefts. The results through similarity are close to the expected ones. Moreover evaluated at different moments it allows to assess the effect of treatment in a single patient, hence providing valuable auxiliary criteria for medical decision making as to the patient's rehabilitation. We include the potential extension of the methodology to other medical disciplines such as speech therapy and reconstructive surgery. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;;8;0;;;;undefined;

For the purpose of identifying and explaining the relationship between gender as related to occupation and psychiatric morbility, an analysis is made of the distribution of the statistics for these disorders for one population of mental patients. Methods: Documentary research was conducted throughout the 1993-1995 period, during which the clinical records of those patients who had been admitted for the first time to a psychiatric hospital in Mexico City over a three-year period were reviewed, obtaining the main socioeconomic and diagnosis-related data. A second stage consisted of the statistical analysis which the relationship among the gender, occupation and diagnosis variables was measured. Results: A total of 1.084 individuals with some mental disorder were recorded, statistically significant differences having been found between men and women with regard to their occupation and to the specific mental disorder with which they were diagnosed, especially as far as depression and drug use-related disorders were concerned. Conclusions: The gender and occupation-related segregation due to said gender are social processes involved in the differential distribution of mental disorders, this being a relationship which is revealed in specific patterns of detriment to the mental health of the males and females who were cared for at this hospital.;Alcoholism | Depression | Gender | Occupational health;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Previous studies have reported the effect of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules in the immune response regulation of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and the association of HLA antigens with heart damage. We studied the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (HLA-A and HLA-B), and class II (HLA-DR) genes in a sample of 66 serologically positive individuals with and without cardiomyopathy, and in 127 healthy controls. The total group of seropositive individuals revealed increased frequencies of HLA-B39 (pc = 4.3×10-5, odds ratio [OR] = 3.35) and DR4 (pc = 1.8×10-5, OR = 2.91) when compared to healthy controls. Increased frequencies of HLA-A68 and HLA-B39 were found in asymptomatic individuals when compared to patients with cardiomyopathy (pc = 0.014, OR = 4.99 and pc = 0.001, OR = 4.46, respectively). Also, patients with cardiomyopathy exhibited increased frequency of HLA-B35 when compared to healthy controls (pc = 0.048, OR = 2.56). The HLA-DR16 frequency was increased in patients with cardiomyopathy compared with asymptomatic individuals (pc = 0.05, OR = No determined) and healthy controls (pc = 0.02, OR = 5.0). The results suggest that MHC alleles might be associated with the development of chronic infection and with heart damage in Chagas' disease. HLA-DR4 and HLA-B39 could be associated directly with the infection by T. cruzi, whereas, HLA-DR16 could be marker of susceptibility to heart damage and HLA-A68 might confer protection to develop cardiomyopathy. © American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics, 2004.

The local deformation model is analyzed in order to guarantee continuity, differentiability and a one-to-one transformation by constraining the parameters of the spatial transformation. The performance of our technique was validated with synthetic images, and MR images. The proposed method was always able to improve the similarity criterion, the normalized mutual information, where accuracy was determined strongly by the resolution and dimensions of the involved domains. The searching strategy was carried out with a hybrid genetic algorithm.;Nonlinear spatial transformation | Nonrigid image registration | Normalized mutual information;0;0;;;;undefined;

Such physical changes may lead to the release of entrapped flavours. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of storage temperature and water activity on caking, stickiness and glass transition temperatures and to evaluate the relative degree of protection provided to orange peel oil entrapped in mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) gum by spray drying. The powders were stored at water activities (aw) ranging from 0.108 to 0.972 at 25 and 35°C. The surface caking temperature (Tsc) and advance caking temperature (Tac) were determined by the modified ampoule and sealed glass tube methods respectively. The glass transition temperature was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Changes in the amount of encapsulated oil were determined by Clevenger hydrodistillation. As expected, both Tsc and T ac decreased with increasing storage aw. Above a w 0.628 the powders caked and collapsed during storage at 35°C. Below aw 0.628 the capsules were not damaged and high retention levels (above 90%) were obtained. Increasing aw in the range 0.743-0.972 caused progressive dissolution of the wall polymer, and the retention level dropped sharply. The volatiles are protected and retained by mesquite gum as long as the capsule structure remains intact. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.;Glass transition | Mesquite gum (Prosopis juliflora) | Microencapsulation | Storage temperature | Water activity;19;0;;;;undefined;

However, the endocrine changes induced by this treatment are controversial. In the present study, we analyzed the levels of corticosterone and testosterone in rats neonatally treated with CMI in response to chronic stress by repeated immersion in cold water. Results obtained in the forced swim test corroborated the effect of neonatal CMI administration, showing a significant increase in immobility time. The testosterone response to stress was similar in both control and CMI-treated rats. Concerning corti-costerone, there was a significantly lower response to stress in CMI-treated rats. The data suggest that CMI induces permanent changes in the reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, without affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Copyright © 2003 S.

These changes are very important for gamete recognition and fertilization in mammals but are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of surface carbohydrates in boar spermatozoa during capacitation and the AR. These processes may be associated with specific changes in the content and distribution of surface carbohydrates. Thirty-nine ejaculates from fertile boars of various breeds were analyzed. N-Acetylglucosamine and sialic acid, mannose and fucose residues were detected by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated lectins. Triticum vulgaris agglutinin (WGA) bound on the head and tail of fresh sperm, and fluorescence intensity (FI) decreased in capacitated sperm (6751 to 5621 fluorescence units (FU), P < 0.05), and decreased further in acrosome-reacted sperm (5240 FU, P < 0.05). Concanavalia ensiformis agglutinin (Con-A) bound homogeneously on the head and the midpiece of fresh sperm with a FI of 5335 FU, and increased in capacitated sperm (5957 FU, P < 0.05) mainly on the acrosomal region. In acrosome-reacted sperm, fluorescence was concentrated on the border of the acrosomal region (5608 FU, P < 0.05). It was not possible to detect Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA) by fluorescence microscopy. However, flow cytometry revealed UEA receptors (187 FU), with a nonsignificant decreased number in capacitated (142 FU) and AR sperm (142 FU). Labeling patterns were similar in all breeds. Sperm glycocalyx modifications observed in this study provide insights to the molecular modifications accompanying capacitation and the AR. This kind of study could improve the diagnosis of reproductive problems of subfertile boars and males of other species. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The experiments were done under forced convection, with water as the working fluid, and constant heat transfer rate at the surface of the pipes. The tubes were of 0.019 m diameter but different longitudes. An electric resistance was wrapped around the tube to provide the flow of heat. The temperature measurement was done with type K thermocouples. A constant load tank provides the necessary pressure for the fluid to flow at constant rate. The results obtained in the tested equipment are within the range of ± 15% from the numerical results found in the literature, thus corroborating the reliability of the equipment.;Entrance region of a pipe | Heat transfer | Laminar flow | Thermal convection coefficient;0;0;;;;undefined;

Alterations of hormonal responses to stressful situations have also been reported. In this study, the levels of corticosterone and testosterone in response to sexual activity were assessed in rats treated neonatally with CMI. Male pups received subcutaneous injections of CMI (15 mg/kg, 0.1 ml), twice a day (09.00 hours and 18.00 hours) from 8 to 21 days of age. A control group received saline in the same number of injections. Four months after CMI treatment, subjects (Ss) were submitted to the forced swim test to verify the effect of CMI. Thereafter, they were tested to assess their spontaneous sexual activity. Plasma levels of corticosterone and testosterone were assessed under different conditions. Results of sexual behavior and the forced swim test corroborate the depressive-like effect of CMI. The sole presence of an estrogenized stimulus female caused an increase in plasma levels of testosterone in both control and CMI-treated Ss. The same was true for corticosterone; however, this increase was significantly lower in the CMI-treated group. There is a discrepancy between the normal hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) response and the decreased sexual behavior.

Electron microscopy revealed a Gram-negative cell wall consisting of a 150nm thick undulating outer membrane. Strain MET2T appeared singly or in long chains and was actively motile with a corkscrew-like motion. The isolate grew optimally at 40°C, pH 7.4 and 3% NaCl in a medium containing lactate, thiosulfate and yeast extract. Sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, and elemental sulfur served as electron acceptors but not nitrate or fumarate. Lactate, pyruvate and H2 (with acetate as carbon source) were used as electron donors. Pyruvate was fermented. Desulfoviridin and cyt c were present. The G+C content of the DNA was 58.7mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequencing showed that strain MET2T was a member of the genus Desulfovibrio with ""D. gracilis"" and D. longus being its closest relatives (similarities of 98.3% and 97.1%, respectively). However, DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated poor homologies (values <70%) with both species.

One hundred and fifty samples of the cereal were collected during the 2001 harvest. The samples were grouped in three lots based on the percentage of crude protein (high, medium, and low). Nine representative samples of each group were analyzed for amino acids. Correlation and regression analysis were performed between the contents of real protein (sum of the contents of all amino acids) and each amino acid. A high variation in the crude protein and amino acids content (CV from 7.4 to 14.0%) was observed in the evaluated wheat samples. The non-essential amino acids were mainly responsible for this variation, because of their higher content as compared with the essential amino acids. Lysine, threonine and methionine had intermediate variability. Glutamate and proline were the most abundant amino acids in wheat. The regression equations of the first limiting amino acids were as follows: Lysine= 0.15982 ±0.012 + 0.01709 ±0.001 (P<0.01; R 2= 0.897); Threonine= 0.08364 ±0.011 + 0.02293 ±0.001 (P<0.01; R 2= 0.952). Based on the regression analysis, it is concluded that protein content is a good estimator of the amino acid content in wheat, and that the regression models obtained from this study allow to save time and money in the analysis of the amino acid content.";;3;0;;;;undefined;

In the present paper an example, using speech signals, is examined by comparing several denoising techniques, including a simple method proposed by the authors.

This compound does not bind to the estrogen receptor (ER), but it shows estrogen-like effects under in vivo and in vitro conditions. The estrogenicity of LNG may be attributed to its bio-transformation into non-phenolic metabolites. In this study, the ability of A-ring reduced LNG metabolites to activate transcription via an estrogenic mechanism of action, including differences between ERα and ERβ subtypes, were investigated. Transactivation assays were performed in HeLa cells transfected with expression vectors for ERα and ERβ and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene. Cells were also transfected with expression vectors for both progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms (A or B). As expected, the tetrahydro derivatives of LNG (3α,5α- and 3β,5α-LNG) showed significantly lower PR-mediated transcriptional activities through both isoforms when compared with progesterone (P4) and LNG. In contrast, the 3β,5α-tetrahydro derivative resulted in a significant activation of estrogen-dependent gene transcription. This effect was selectively confined to the ERα, since little if any activity could be observed with the ERβ and no antagonistic activities were demonstrated. This study provides structural and molecular clues for the well documented in vitro and in vivo intrinsic estrogenicity of 19-nor-testosterone-derived progestins and ligand requirements for ERα recognition. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The tongues of 1087 (84%) of these pigs were visually examined and 33% were found to be cysticercotic. Castration of male pigs increased prevalence from 23 to 50% (P<0.001) and pregnancy in sows also increased their prevalence from 28 to 59% (P<0.001). Thus, endocrinological conditions characterized by low levels of androgens or high levels of female hormones probably influence the susceptibility of pigs to T. solium cysticercosis as observed in mice infected with Taenia crassiceps. Delaying castration of male pigs and confinement of sows during pregnancy might significantly decrease the prevalence of pig-cysticercosis and help curb transmission without much cost or difficulty. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The modes of the unknown density function can be calculated by applying the mean-shift method. This nonparametric technique allows an analysis which only depends on a specific bandwidth. The mean-shift approach was applied to brain MR images to obtain clusters of white and gray matters and cerebrospinal fluid. Segmented images with this robust scheme show a higher index of similarity when compared against manually traced structures and its performance is superior to other segmentation procedures.;Mean shift | Nonparametric estimation | Segmentation;3;0;;;;undefined;

Methods: From 1985 to 1999, a kidney graft survival longer than 3 months occurred in 293 cases at the Instituto Nacional de la Nutrición. Most of the patients living in Mexico City were included (n = 83). The evaluation included a questionnaire, blood samples, and assessment of body composition and dietary habits. As many as possible first-degree relatives were studied. Results: Women had higher values of cholesterol (236 ± 51 versus 215 ±41; P < 0.05), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (147 ± 42 versus 131 ± 34; P = 0.05), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (57.3 ± 14 versus 47.9 ± 14; P = 0.002) and high-density lipoprotein-2 cholesterol. Isolated hypercholesterolemia was the most common lipid abnormality (40.9%), followed by mixed hyperlipidemia. Lipoprotein (a) greater than 30 mg/dL was found in 13 cases. Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) in the patient's relatives was a marker for dyslipidemia (odds ratio, 7.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 59.7). These cases had a worse lipid profile. Cyclosporine-treated FCHL patients had higher lipid levels compared with the non-FCHL, cyclosporine-treated patients. The effects of cyclosporine on the lipid levels were lower, but significant, after the exclusion of the FCHL cases. Conclusion: Post-transplant dyslipidemia is determined by genetic and environmental factors. FCHL in the patient's relatives was associated with post-transplant hyperlipidemia; an additive effect with cyclosporine was found. The evaluation of the lipid profile of relatives may be useful for the assessment of the risk of post-transplant dyslipidemia. © 2002 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.";Cholesterol | Cyclosporine | Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) | Mexico | Renal transplantation;18;0;;;;undefined;

The strategy to transform the predominantly public health care system into a market-driven system has been a complex process with a hidden agenda to avoid political resistance. The compulsory social security system is the key sector in opening health care to private insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, and hospital enterprises mainly from abroad. Despite the government's commitment to universal coverage, equity, efficiency, and quality, the empirical data analyzed in this article do not confirm compliance with these objectives. Although an alternative health policy that gradually grants the constitutional fight to health would be feasible, the new democratically elected government will continue the previous regressive health reform.;;41;0;;;;undefined;

In other cell types, ionic gradients are mainly regulated by the presence in plasma membranes of three metabolically different types of ATPases. The modifications induced during in vitro capacitation of rabbit spermatozoa by the specific inhibition of V-type H+ -ATPases with bafilomycin A were studied. We used chlortetracycline binding to rabbit spermatozoa to monitor capacitation, and the coomassie brilliant blue method to identify acrosome-reacted sperm cells. There was a significant difference between the percentage of epididymal (66 ± 7%) and ejaculated (43 ± 11%) spermatozoa capacitated in vitro, after a 6-h incubation period in the presence of Ca2+ without ATPase inhibitor. The presence of bafilomycin significantly reduced these numbers (25 ± 11 and 16 ± 8%, epididymal and ejaculated spermatozoa, respectively) and eliminated the difference. Ejaculated spermatozoa capacitated in the absence of bafilomycin showed a linear increase in the percentage of acrosome reactions induced by the addition of A23187 (12±5, 23±6 and 31±5 after 15, 30 and 45 min). The presence of 0.2 μmol-1 bafilomycin during the capacitation incubation induced a significant decrease in the acrosome reaction percentages (4±2, 8±3 and 14±4 after 15, 30 and 45 min). The addition of bafilomycin after the capacitating period had no effect upon the induction of the acrosome reaction by A23187. These results indicate that vacuolar ATPases play an important role during rabbit sperm capacitation. However, once the spermatozoa have been capacitated, V-type ATPases do not have a significant participation during the acrosome reaction.;Acrosome reaction | Bafilomycin | Capacitation | Rabbit spermatozoa | V-type H -ATPase +;5;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Hepatocytes are generally considered as targets but not producers of these important mediators. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether cells of hepatocellular lineage are a potential source of various cytokines we estimated the expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta 1, and interleukins 1 beta, 6 and 8 in the culture of well-differentiated human HepG2 cells treated for 24 hours with ethanol, acetaldehyde and lipopolysaccharide. Lipid peroxidation damage, glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase activity were also determined. METHODS: HepG2 cells were treated for 24 hours with ethanol (50 mM), acetaldehyde (175 microM) and LPS (1 microgram/ml). TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and secretion by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Lipid peroxidation damage, glutathione content and antioxidant enzyme activities were determined spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: Exposure to ethanol for 24 hours induced the expression of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1, secretion of IL-1 beta and TGF-beta 1 and decreased catalase activity. Acetaldehyde markedly increased TNF-alpha and IL-8 expression, stimulated IL-1 beta and IL-8 secretion, increased lipid peroxidation damage and decreased catalase activity, while LPS exposure induced the expression of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, IL-6 and IL-8, the secretion of TGF-beta 1, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8, and a decrease in catalase activity. No change in GSH, GSHPx or SOD was found in any experimental condition. CONCLUSIONS: The present studies confirm and extend the notion that hepatocytes respond to ethanol, acetaldehyde and LPS-producing cytokines.

Diurnal variations of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum, frontal cortex, and amygdala of the rat, were characterized by the stereospecific binding of [3H]-spiperone. Clear rhythms were found in all these areas, but asynchronous to each other. Striatal receptors had diurnal variations with a single peak at 00:00 hours. Frontal cortex receptors showed two peaks at 00:00 and 12:00 hours. Amygdaline complex receptors had two peaks at 18:00 and 06:00 hours. Saturation binding curves and their Scatchard analysis indicated that the diurnal variations in [3H]-spiperone binding are related to changes in receptor density rather than its affinity. The diurnal variations asynchrony in [3H]-spiperone binding to dopaminergic D2 receptors from different neural regions, suggest different regulation in each area. Other functional implications of these rhythms remains to be established.;Amygdala | Chronopharmacology | Dopamine | Frontal cortex | Striatum;3;0;;;CONACYT;33034-M;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a powerful imaging modality to quantify blood flow. To gain insight of the hemodynamics of the human cardiovascular system, acquisition time of MR images must be reduced. It is necessary to produce faster imaging methods to avoid motion artifacts, such as blurring and ghosting, which alter the image quality. To solve this problem a flow-encoded Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence combined with a Half Fourier method is proposed to determine blood flow in the cardiovascular system. Methods. This imaging modality was used to quantify blood flow in large vessels such as the human aorta. We acquired transaxial 128×128 images, with a slice of 1-cm thickness and 2.5 mm in-plane resolution. All these images were used to measure blood flow in the ascending aorta and descending aorta of nine healthy male volunteers and one female volunteer, ages 22-35 years. Results. Velocity profiles and blood flow maps were obtained from healthy volunteers and compared with other imaging techniques. Conclusions. It has been demonstrated that Half Fourier EPI flow sequence can become a suitable flow measurement technique for real-time magnetic resonance angiography. It provides us with morphological and functional information of the cardiovascular system. 2001 IMSS.

It has been proposed that some of its effects are of nongenomic origin E2 at vascular smooth muscle level can block calcium entry through L-type calcium channels, this mechanism cannot include vascular endothelial cells (VECs), in which increases in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i)) are necessary to NO synthesis. We used male rat aorta ECs in culture loaded with fura-2 and a fluorescence imaging system to evaluate the short-term effects of E2 on [Ca2+](i) kinetics. We explored the participation of the intracellular steroid receptor on the effects induced by E2, using tamoxifen (1 μM) and ICI 182,780 (10 μM). Our results showed that E2 (like bradykinin) induced an increase in [Ca2+](i). Such agonist-like effects showed a biphasic curve behavior. The 17β-estradiol effects were not modified by the presence of the intracellular estradiol-receptor antagonist tamoxifen, but it is blocked in the presence of the ICI 182,780. The 17β-estradiol effects were obtained even with restriction of steroid-free diffusion into cells (17β-estradiol-bovine serum albumin). Phospholipase C(β) activity is involved in these effects, because U-73122, a PLC(β) inhibitor, blocked E2 effects. All E2 effects were of rapid onset (milliseconds), exerted at the membrane level, and of rapid offset. We conclude that estradiol can influence the endothelium physiologic responses through effects of nongenomic origin.;Endothelium | Estradiol | ICI 182,780 | Intracellular calcium | Phospholipase C;42;0;;;;undefined;

The inhibition of the digestive gland ACHase reached 76% when the carbaryl concentration in tissue was 3.2 μg/g. The increased enzyme inhibition was observed concomitantly with the bioconcentration of carbaryl until 7 h. ACHase inhibition was linearly dependent on the uptake and bioconcentration of carbaryl (r2 = 0.87). The transfer of snails to carbaryl-free water after 72 h of exposure was followed by rapid monophasic elimination with a half-life of 1.0 h.

The observation that contraceptive synthetic progestins exert hormone-like effects other than their progestational activities, prompted us to investigate whether gestodene (GSD) administration may induce oestrogenic effects, even though the GSD molecule does not interact with intracellular oestrogen receptors (ER). To assess whether GSD may exert oestrogenic effects through some of its neutral metabolites, a series of experimental studies were undertaken using GSD and three of its A-ring reduced metabolites. Receptor binding studies by displacement analysis confirmed that indeed GSD does not bind to the ER, whereas its 3β,5α-tetrahydro reduced derivative (3βGSD) interacts with a relative high affinity with the ER. The 3α,5α GSD isomer (3αGSD) also binds to the ER, though to a lesser extent. The ability of the A-ring reduced GSD derivatives to induce oestrogenic actions was evaluated by the use of two different molecular bioassays: (a) transactivation of a yeast system cotransfected with the human ERα (hERα) gene and oestrogen responsive elements fused to the α-galactosidase reporter vector and (b) transactivation of the hERα-mediated transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene in a HeLa cells expression system. The oestrogenic potency of 3βGSD was also assessed by its capability to induce oestrogen-dependent progestin receptors (PR) in the anterior pituitary of castrated female rats. The results demonstrated that 3βGSD and 3αGSD were able to activate, in a dose-dependent manner, the hERαmediated transcription of both the β-galactosidase and the CAT reporter genes in the yeast and HeLa cells expression systems respectively. In both assays the 3β derivative of GSD exhibited a significantly greater oestrogenic effect than its 3α isomer, while unchanged GSD and 5αGSD were completely ineffective. Neither 3βGSD nor 3αGSD exhibited oestrogen synergistic actions. Interestingly, the pure steroidal anti-oestrogen ICI-182,780 diminished the transactivation induced by 3βGSD and 3αGSD in the yeast expression system. Furthermore, administration of 3βGSD resulted in a significant increase of oestrogendependent PR in the anterior pituitaries of castrated rats in comparison with vehicle-treated animals. The characteristics of the 3βGSD- induced PR were identical to those induced by oestradiol benzoate. The overall results demonstrate that 3βGSD and its 3α isomeric alcohol specifically bind to the ER and possess a weak intrinsic oestrogenic activity, whereas unmodified GSD does not. The data contribute to a better understanding of the GSD mechanism of action and allow the hypothesis to be advanced that the slight oestrogenlike effects attributable to GSD are mediated by its non-phenolic, tetrahydro reduced metabolites.;;23;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The serotonin,, receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, 1 mg/kg, inhibited male rabbit sexual behavior when animals were tested 15 min after subcutaneous (SC) administration of this compound. Lower doses, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, were ineffective at a test 30 min after drug injection. Furthermore, 8-OH-DPAT, 0.25 mg/kg, failed to revert the inhibitory effects upon sexual behavior produced by lidocaine application to the rabbit penis. Stimulation of 5-HT(1B/2C) receptors by TFMPP, at doses between 0.625 and 2.5 mg/kg, produced a drastic inhibition of sexual behavior when the drug was administered SC 30 min before behavioral observation. Doses below 5 mg/kg were ineffective when given intraperitoneally 15 min before test. When the 5-HT(1D/2C) receptors were stimulated by the agonist mCPP a reduced number of mounts and ejaculations was observed after the SC administration of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg. Similarly, the mixed 5-HT agonist/antagonist lisuride reduced the percentage of rabbits displaying mounting behavior at doses of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg SC. All compounds tested produced a clear inhibition of male rabbit sexual behavior independently of the receptor subtype activated. These results are at variance with previous observations in rats where 8-OH-DPAT and lisuride produced a drastic facilitation of masculine coital behavior. Moreover, while the inhibition of male sexual behavior in rats produced by TFMPP and mCPP is associated with a disruption of the execution of this behavior, in rabbits these compounds reduced sexual motivation. These results indicate that the effects of serotonergic drugs on sexual behavior are species specific.;Penile anesthesia | Rabbit | Serotonin | Sexual behavior;14;0;;;;undefined;

Results: The proportion of caries-free 12-year-old children was 28.6% and 9.5% in the private and public schools, respectively (P<0.01). In 12-year-old children, DMFT was 2.78 (SD 2.9) and 4.64 (SD 3.2) in the private and public school groups, respectively (P<0.001). Higher treatment needs were found among public schoolchildren (TN=83.0%) compared with private schoolchildren (TN=27.6%) (P<0.001). Conclusions: Dental caries and treatment needs were considerably higher in children of lower SES. Differences in dietary patterns and toothpaste use could be the more likely explanations for these findings, indicating markedly unequal burdens of disease according to socio-economic status. Special efforts should be developed to improve the oral health status in Mexico City children by implementing preventive health promotion and treatment programmes.;Caries | Epidemiology | Mexico | Socio-economic status | Treatment needs;48;0;;;;undefined;

There are sex differences in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and great attention has been placed on the study of estrogen cardiovascular effects. However, there are only a few reports on the effects of testosterone on the vasculature. It is commonly accepted that the mechanism of the action of steroid hormones on target tissues is mediated through the binding of hormones to cytoplasmic or nuclear receptors. However, some studies indicate that steroid action can be extremely rapid and therefore unlikely to be through a genomic mechanism. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of intravascularly confined testosterone on an isolated rat heart to demonstrate acute and possibly nongenomic effects of the steroid. Our results show that testosterone blocked the adenosine vasodilator effect and increased vascular resistance, even when its presence was restricted to the coronary vascular lumen. These effects were exerted rapidly and possibly through nongenomic mechanisms.;Hypertension | Steroid hormones | Testosterone;71;0;;;;undefined;

The results are reported of studying three sherds from the archaeological site in Calixtlahuaca, Mexico, where the Matlazinca culture blossomed before the Spanish arrived in America. The thermoluminescence dating technique used was that of fine grain using grain sizes in the range of 4 to 11 μm. Paleodose and the supralinearity correction factor were determined by means of analysis of the glow curve in the temperature range of 250 to 500°C. The average values of paleodose obtained were 8.46 ± 0.27 Gy and 3.62 ± 0.13 Gy for two of the samples studied; the annual dose rates were 5.55 ± 0.20 mGy and 4.20 ± 0.30 mGy. Taking into account these results, the ages of these two ceramic samples were 1520 ± 90 and 870 ± 80 years which agree well with the historical data for the site.

As a consequence of an membrane potential or a concentration change, we numerically evaluate the participation of this exchanger in returning to equilibrium cellular conditions. In our model, the Na+-Ca++ exchanger is supposed to work joined to other important regulation mechanisms such as the Calcium Pump, the Calcium Channels, the Calcium Buffers and, the passive Diffusion of Calcium, as described in past works. For evaluating the latter parameter, we are using a previously reported homogeneous multi-layer model of an spherical cell. The graphical and numerical results were obtained using a PC-based environment over the Matlab platform, and it was compared to the results obtained with a C-language simulation. The results showed the Na+-Ca++ exchanger is always participating in the transport of Calcium ions, and it only modifies its direction and/or its speed, as a consequence of a stimuli. Our model also simulate the reversible behaviour of the exchanger for free Sodium or Calcium variations, including the influence of the membrane potential and the affinity values. Because of the high time constant of the Na+-Ca++ exchanger, the simulation must be robust enough to evaluate all the changes occurring during a long time. With our currently simulation programs, it is only possible to do it for the first seconds. Nevertheless, we are now working in the improvement (precision, speed, resources) of the work described, using a SGI workstation and a parallel processing environment.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

In both experimental animals and in humans the production and secretion of less acidic, short-lived FSH glycoforms significantly increase during the peri-ovulatory period. To gain further insights on the physiological role of these FSH variants, we analysed the ability of two FSH compounds, recombinant FSH (rFSH) and purified FSH from urinary origin (uFSH), (less acidic and acidic pattern of FSH charge isoform distributors respectively) to induce ovarian tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) enzyme activity in vivo. FSH produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells and highly purified uFSH were injected at 15:00 h on the pro-oestrous day into phenobarbital-blocked rats and the ovaries were analysed for tPA enzyme activity and tPA mRNA concentrations at different times after FSH injection. Induction of tPA enzyme activity by uFSH and rFSH showed distinct dynamics depending on the particular preparation administered. In animals treated with uFSH, maximum tPA enzyme activity was detected at 20:00 h, and maximum tPA mRNA concentrations were detected at 17:00 h. tPA enzyme activity induction by rFSH was at the maximum at 17:00 h, and maximum tPA mRNA concentration was at 16:00 h (P < 0.05 for uFSH versus rFSH). All animals in the uFSH- and rFSH- treated groups and none in phenobarbital-blocked, saline-treated controls ovulated. No significant differences were present in the number of ova shed by rats treated with uFSH or rFSH and spontaneously ovulating rats (10.7 ± 1.7, 10.0 ± 2.6 and 11.3 ± 1.6 respectively). These data indicate that the increased biological activity exhibited by less acidic FSH glycovariants at the target cell level may compensate for the drawback imposed by their relatively short plasma half-life.;FSH variants | Plasminogen activator | Rat | Recombinant FSH | Urinary FSH;27;0;;;;undefined;

Primiparous goats (n=21), showing seronegativity to Brucella abortus, B. mellitensis and Leptospira pomona were used. Blood samples were collected weekly to determine Ct and progesterone (P4) during the last third of pregnancy (90-150 days). Using birth and abortion as criteria, two groups were formed: one including animals which delivered on time (PG), n=14, and another with those animals which were aborted (AG), n=7. Ct was determined by a competitive protein-binding assay and P4 was determined by radioimmunoassay. Present results show that the mean values of Ct in PG and AG groups were similar from 90 days of pregnancy to 7 days before delivery or abortion occurred. However, in AG the Ct levels rose to 46.1 ng/ml during the 7-day interval prior to abortion. In contrast, the Ct levels in PG only reached 11.4 ng/ml in the 7-day interval prior to delivery. Circulating P4 values showed a negative correlation (PG, r=0.98 and AG, r=0.99) to those of Ct from Day 21 before delivery or abortion to Day 0 (day of delivery or abortion). © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The GABA(A) agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroxixazolo-5,4c-pyridin-3-ol (THIP), the GABA(B) agonist R-baclofen and the GABA antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline were used. Injection of THIP, 20 mg/kg, s.c. produced a complete suppression of sexual behaviour and R-baclofen, 2.5 mg/kg, s.c. a significant inhibition. Intraperitoneal injections produced effects at higher doses than did s.c. injections. The inhibition produced by R-baclofen was associated with strong motor effects as shown by the water escape test. It is probable, therefore, that the reduced sexual behaviour observed after treatment with this drug is a consequence of sedative or muscle relaxant effects. By contrast, the dose of THIP that inhibited sexual behaviour had no effect on the water escape test. These results show that the GABA(A) agonist inhibits sexual behaviour in the male rabbit independent of effects on the motor system. The GABA antagonists had marginal or no effects on sexual behaviour. When these data are compared to previous results in the rat, substantial differences are seen. As there are differences between the effects on rat and rabbit sexual behaviour by other types of drugs, it appears that drug action on sexual behaviour cannot be generalized from one species to another.;GABA | Motor performance | Rabbit | Sexual behaviour;9;0;;;;undefined;

By taking a high-gain parametrization of the feedback control, the presence of nonsymmetric (first harmonic) periodic orbits is demonstrated for certain values of the parameter. Since it is also shown that nonsymmetric periodic orbits do not exist for small and large values of the parameter, evidences are found of the existence of symmetry breaking bifurcations.;;6;0;;;;undefined;

Phosphorylation of synaptic proteins plays a crucial role in neuronal function. In particular, phosphorylation of synapsin I by calmodulin dependent multiprotein kinase II modulates both vesicle transport and neurotransmitter release at the synaptic cleft. Recently, it has been described that melatonin may modulate protein phosphorylation through inhibition of calmodulin dependent protein kinase II activity. As a first step to elucidate the mechanism involved in melatonin inhibition of neurotransmitter release, in this work we studied the effects of the hormone on hypothalamic synaptosome protein phosphorylation. The results indicate that used synaptosomes in phosphorylation assays were functional since 3H- GABA release and an increase of 50 % in protein phosphorylation were elicited with a high potassium concentration. Melatonin at 1 nM inhibited phosphorylation of 50, 54, 58-60 and 87 Kd protein bands in both basal synaptosomes (30 %) and K C1 depolarized (50 %). The results suggest that melatonin may modulate neurotransmitter release through an inhibition of synaptosomal protein phosphorylation mediated by calmodulin dependent protein kinase II.;Calmodulin | Melatonin | Phosphorylation | Synaptososomes;1;0;;;;undefined;

The activity of metalloproteinases (collagenases, gelatinase, and Pz-peptidase), was measured during growth, maturation and atresia of goat antral follicles. These follicles (n = 67) were separated by size and also classified into four groups: non-atretic (Group I); early atretic (Stage I) (Group II); moderately atretic (Stage II) (Group IIIa); and late atretic (Stage III) (Group IIIb). Pz-peptidase was greater in granulosa than in thecal cells, and almost absent in follicular fluid. In non-atretic follicles, activity in granulosa cells increased with increasing follicle size, whereas activity peaked in 3-6 mm follicles in thecal cells. Atresia was associated with declining activity in thecal cells from follicles in the 3-6 mm range and in granulosa cells from the > 6 mm range. Interstitial collagenase activity was significant and similar in granulosa and thecal cell extracts and low in follicular fluid from non-atretic follicles. Activity increased significantly in thecal cells, but decreased significantly in granulosa cells from large (> 6 mm) non-atretic follicles.

Some of these models attempt to reproduce in animals some of the features of the human depressive pattern. Some other models try to simulate the neurochemical abnormalities underlying in the disease. A third group of animal models pretends to be useful to selectively detect drugs with antidepressive actions. Thus, each animal model proposal for the study of depression must assess its validity in each one of these criteria. In this paper we review the most recent evidences that have been generated supporting the validity of the Flinders rats as an important animal model of depression. The Flinders Sensitive Line of rats was originated in Australia, selectively reproducing rats from the Sprague-Dawley strain that displayed hypersensitivity to cholinergic stimulation, as well as alterations in certain behavioral patterns that resemble those observed in human depressive patterns. These characteristics were reproduced in the subsequent generations thus starting a special colony and a large series of different kinds of studies that have confirmed and extended the original observations. The face validity in the Flinders rats is mainly based on the fact that they present a clearly diminished frequency of the presentation of pleasure seeking behavioral patterns, this has been interpreted as anhedonia, which is one the major characteristics of human depression. Other features are alterations of motor behavior, body weight, a reduction of the REM sleep latency and an increase of its duration, exaggerated response to some stressors and alterations on the execution of different behavioral tests made in the laboratory, these being indicative of a mood alteration. Regarding the construct validity, the evidences that have been obtained up to date are confronted with at least two hypothesis of the origin of depression: the cholinergic hypothesis and the serotonergic hypothesis. Both theories are congruent with the exaggerated responses observed after the selective stimulation of each one of these systems, particularly of the muscarinic receptors in the cholinergic system and the 5-HT1 a receptors in the serotonergic system. Regarding the capacity of this model to respond to the treatment with antidepressive drugs, the existing evidences suggest that some of the abnormalities these rats present are drastically reduced or totally normalized after chronic treatment with classic tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine and more specific antidepressants of the noradrenergic and serotoninergic systems, such as desimipramine and sertraline, respectively. The balance that is presented indicates that the Flinders rats are a model that recognizes the genetic component of depression; that reproduces some of its central characteristics; that presents cholinergic and serotonergic system alterations and that responds by normalizing its alterations to antidepressive treatment. Therefore, an exhaustive study of this model appears as a very relevant possibility to gain deeper knowledge about the cerebral phenomena that come with this illness, as well as an increase of the possibilities to generate new therapeutic alternatives.";animal model | depression | Flinders rats;0;0;;;;undefined;

Pelvic thrusting in all copulatory behavioral responses appeared as series or trains of rhythmical, synchronic, vigorous movements. The various pelvic thrusting trains lasted around 1 s on average, but those of mounts were significantly longer than the trains displayed in the other behavioral responses. The frequencies of pelvic thrusting were similar in all responses (around 15 thrusts per s) excepting mounts which had lower values. In intromission, ejaculation, and long intromission responses, when penile insertion occurred, pelvic thrusting either was interrupted or showed changes in its characteristics: penile insertion was related to a period without thrusting in intromissions, to a series of intravaginal thrusting of higher frequency (16.4 thrusts per s) and lower vigor in ejaculations, and to a prolonged period of 6 to 25 s of slow intravaginal pelvic thrusting (1-2 thrusts per s) in long intromissions. Penile insertion lasted longer in ejaculations than in intromissions and it was significantly shorter in both of these responses than in long intromissions.

The population under study includes all neonatal deaths occured at a third level hospital in Mexico City, from January 1, 1987 to July 31, 1994 (n = 1337). Only 56% of neonatal deaths could follow HERMAN'S classification (n = 749). Poor concordance (Cohen's Kappa = 0.30) between the two methods was found. A high proportion of deaths (72.7%) was classified ambiguously (as possibly preventable), and also a considerable proportion of deaths could not be classified (44%). High sensitivity (96%) was found for the small percentage of cases in which avoidance was determined by the method under assessment (15%).

Present studies were designed to explore the possibility that ring-A reduced progesterone metabolites might play a role in controlling the duration of estrous behavior. To this aim ovariectomized (ovx) Sprague Dawley rats implanted with guide cannulae directed towards the VMH or the MPOA were submitted to a systemic hormonal treatment to provoke P-induced sequential inhibition (estradiol benzoate (EB) at time 0 + P at 44 h + P at 68 h). The second dose of P was administered simultaneously with the ic implantation of one of the following P metabolites: 3β-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one (5β,3αP), 3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one (5β,3αP) or 3β-hydroxy-5βpregnan-20-one (5α,3βP) into the MPOA or VMH. Lordosis behavior was evaluated by the lordosis quotient (LQ = number of lordosis/10 male mount x 100) and by the percentage of responding subjects. Results show that 5β,3βP implanted into the VMH or MPOA counteracted the sequential inhibitory effect induced by systemic administration of P. 5α,3βP was also able to counteract sequential inhibition, but with less potency and only in the VMFI. Results show that P-induced sequential inhibition can be counteracted by intrabrain administration of ring-A reduced progestins in both the VMH and MPOA.

Twenty rats underwent 90% midgut resection and twelve were used as controls. Half the animals were treated with neurotensin (600 μg/kg-day) until sacrifice 30 days later. Body and bone weight were measured and mucosal samples obtained. All resected animals lost body weight and bone weight. Neurotensin treatment reduced femur weight loss. After bowel resection, significant trophic effects were observed at mucosal level (crypt and villous size) but only in the jejunum of resected animals neurotensin treatment had a trophic effect.

Samples were obtained by double-oblique hauls with a 333-505 μm bongo net. The study was done with samples from the 333-μm net, extrapolating the values to g/100 m3 of wet weight. In January, values between 78 and 3,340 g/100 m3 were found; results in May were between 143 and 6,920 g/100 m3; and in November, between 27 and 2,290 g/100 m3. We consider that the distributions obtained in January and in November were induced by upwelling and the contribution of the coastal lagoons.

Mullerian and Wolffian structures are usually present, and external genitalia are often ambiguous. The most frequent karyotype in these patients is 46,XX or various forms of mosaicism, whereas 46,XY is very rarely found. The phenotype in all these subjects is similar. We studied 10 true hermaphrodites. Six of them had a 46,XX chromosomal complement: 3 had been reared as males and 3 as females. The other 4 patients were mosaics: 3 were 46,XX/46,XY and one had a 46,XX/47,XXY karyotype. One of the 46,XX/46,XY mosaics was reared as a female, whereas the other 3 mosaics were reared as males. The sex of assignment in the 10 patients depended only on labio-scrotal differentiation. Molecular studies in 46,XX subjects documented the absence of Y centromeric sequences in all cases, arguing against hidden mosaicism. One patient presented Yp sequences (ZFY+, SRY+), which contrast with South African black 46,XX true hermaphrodites in whom no Y sequences were found. Molecular analysis in the subjects with mosaicism demonstrated the presence of Y centromeric and Yp sequences confirming the presence of a Y chromosome. Gonadal development, endocrine function, and phenotype in the 10 patients did not correlate with the presence of a Y chromosome or Y-derived sequences in the genome, confirming that true hermaphroditism is a heterogeneous condition.

Nevertheless, little is known about the effect that different stressors could have on sexual behavior. In this work we studied the effect of different stressors applied both acutely and chronically on masculine sexual behavior. Sexually active male Wistar rats were submitted to stress by: immobilization (IMB); immersion in cold water (WIM); and electrical foot shock (EFS). These stressors were applied during 20 consecutive days and masculine sexual behavior was assessed on days 1, 4, 8, 12, 15 and 20. Motivational component, copulatory performance and copulatory potential were drastically altered by WIM. EFS produced significant alterations in almost all sexual parameters recorded but only when it was applied chronically. IMB only altered mount frequency and hit rate, although inconsistently. These results suggest that the effect of stress on sexual behavior depends on the nature and, in some conditions, on the duration of the stressor.";Acute stress | Chronic stress | Foot shocks | Immobilization | Sexual behaviour | Water immersion;60;0;;;;undefined;

Among the various TL phosphors developed in our laboratory, LiF:Mg,Cu,P has turned out to be of special interest since it meets these requirements. This encouraged investigation on the luminescence properties of the above dopants in crystals of LiF. TL and optical properties of LiF:Cu2+ were investigated as a part of a broader research project on TL mechanisms in various materials. Cu2+ ions are responsible for optical emission, while Mg and P impurities mostly cooperate to increase the intensity of TL signals. The effects of ionising radiation on CU2+ -doped LiF phosphor are determined here by means of thermoluminescence and optical absorption experiments with the aim of identifying new defects formed in this system and of testing its dosimetric characteristics. Defects due to aggregation of impurity ions with colour centres created by ionising radiation are found to be responsible for new absorption bands and for significant changes in the glow curve.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

Processing of lung sounds is not an exemption. In this case the heart sounds are unavoidable and sometimes severe disturbing noise source. Previous studies indicated that the performance of any interference cancellation scheme relies strongly on an adequate time delay estimation between the reference and the primary signals. In this paper, a new procedure for time delay estimation using the multi-resolution framework is presented. The proposed methodology possesses such key benefits as the multiple looks information of a signal at different bands, robustness in presence of noise and a validation procedure for the delay estimates. The procedure is applicable to a broad range of problems where time delay estimation is required. Results obtained with lung sounds show the promise of the scheme for the time delay estimation and subsequent interference cancellation.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

Micronucleus frequencies were analyzed in binucleate cells produced by the cytokinesis block method. The overall micronucleus frequency was significantly higher in binucleate cells from malnourished rats (21.3%‰) as compared to that observed in control rats (11.5%‰). The number of binucleate cells with more than one micronucleus was also higher in malnourished rats than in controls (3.1%‰ vs. 1.2%‰). These results indicate that severe malnutrition produces cellular damage in vivo, as was evidenced by the increased micronucleus frequency in rat spleen lymphocytes in vitro. This damage may produce negative effects for the further development of the organism, since the spleen is an important lymphopoietic organ in rodents. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

The proportion of caries‐free children was only 10%, and the DMFS index was 6.94. 78% of the index derived from decayed surfaces, and 19% from filled surfaces. Pits and fissures of the permanent first molars were the most frequently affected surfaces. Higher dental caries scores were found in rural areas compared with the urban centers. No significant relationship was found between use of dentifrice and dental caries. Several reasons for this lack of relationship are discussed. 10% of the children account for 23% of the DMFS index. Results indicate the need to aim preventive and restorative programs at the whole population as well as at specific high risk groups or individuals. 1994 Munksgaard;dental canes | Mexican children | salt fluoridation | treatment need;18;0;;;;undefined;

Synaptosomal and mitochondrial fractions were characterized with plasma membrane and mitochondrial enzymatic markers. Synaptoso‐mal Na+‐K+‐ATPase was not affected in vitro by PHT 1–200 μM or by chronic treatment with 2–50 mg/kg/day of the unlabeled drug for 8 days. Mitochondria1 Mg2+‐ATPase was significantly stimulated by PHT after chronic treatment with 5 mg/kg/day for 8 days; reaching maximal effect (76%), at 10–25 mg/kg. PHT had no effect on mitochondrial Mg2+‐ATPase when added in vitro. [14C]‐PHT binding in vitro to the subcellular fractions was determined by dialysis to assess in vivo binding of the unlabeled PHT during chronic treatment. Indeed, [14C]‐PHT bound to synaptosomes was significantly reduced by chronic PHT treatment from 218 ±10 to 119 & 11 pmol/mg protein after 1 week of treatment; a similar effect was obtained after 2–3 weeks with 10 mg/kg/day. Mitochondrial fraction bound 117 ±10 pmol/mg protein labeled PHT. Chronic treatment with unlabeled PHT also reduced the amount of [14C]‐PHT bound to 19.9 ± 2.2 pmol/mg protein. These results show slow reversible PHT in vivo binding to synaptosomes and mitochondrias from rat cerebral cortex, supporting the idea that the modulatory action of PHT on Na+ and Ca2+ permeabilities are mediated through these slow reversible binding proteins. The data also suggest a possible role of intra synaptosomal mitochondria in [Ca2+]i buffering. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) was the most frequent malignancy (81%) followed by non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (12%). All cases of NHL were of high or intermediate grade and most of them were extranodal. Out of the 34 individuals with KS, 22 (65%) showed oral KS and in 21 of them the palate was involved. The clinical features of oral KS including site, appearance and size are described. Pseudo‐membranous candidosis (PC), hairy leukoplakia (HL) and exfoliative cheilitis (ECh) were also found in these patients. There was no association of these lesions with any type of cancer. A strong association of oral candidosis and history of this infection was found, RR = 7.0 (1.3–4.1). There was evidence of severe immunosuppression in most patients, with mean average CD4 counts of 116 mm3 (range 4–841 /mm3). Oral KS, ECh, PC and HL were more common in patients with lower CD4 counts. Our findings illustrate the most frequent oral lesions associated with HIV‐1 infection in patients with AIDS and cancer, and further support the importance of oral examination in HIV infected patients.

The exponential growth in new non-Roman Catholic religious movements since the 1950s and the breadth of their organized networks have stimulated research based more often on sensationalism than on a scientific perspective. The complex and pluralistic manifestations of this heterodox religious phenomenon have generally been reduced to a notion of Protestantism rarely found in scholarly usage. The multiplicity of non-Roman Catholic religious movements cannot be reduced to some catchall category of Protestantism. Moreover, one must also analyze the connection between usage of the term Protestant and a culture marked by the Spanish Inquisition, which shaped the Ibero-American collective unconscious for more than three centuries, in order to understand why a fair number of Latin American researchers look at religious dissidence rather superficially, reducing it immediately to Protestantism.;;62;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;TF;undefined;Tinker Foundation

It has been particularly difficult to succeed in the achievement of fertilization in the pig.

In purified subsets of human cortical and medullary thymocytes dexamethasone caused cell lysis with similar kinetics in both populations; 50% of thymocytes were killed after 20–24 h of incubation with the steroid. The mechanism of dexamethasone‐induced cell death seems to correspond to apoptosis since degradation of DNA into oligonucleosome‐sized fragments could be observed in the cultures treated with the steroid. A certain degree of DNA fragmentation and cell death could also be observed in control cultures of thymocytes. In contrast, peripheral T lymphocytes were resistant to the cytolytic effect of glucocorticoid hormone. The killing of human thymocytes by dexamethasone was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that this cell death program requires a fully operating protein synthesis machinery and perhaps the induction of new proteins.

Small amounts of starter culture (1% v/w) were required to produce a high level of lactic acid (> 28 g kg−1 DM) and to reach a pH of at least 4. The Gompertz model was used to evaluate the effect of inoculation level on the lactic formation based on kinetic criteria. Also an empirical pH lactic acid correlation was proposed to monitor the progress of ensiling, based solely on pH measurements. The simulation model may be used to improve guidelines for silo safety and to evaluate the effect of lactobacilli inoculants.

The acidification kinetics were followed during the first 2 days. Dry matter, pH and other fermentation byproducts were also determined. The optimum temperature for the production of lactic acid was 30°C. Rate constants (k) were calculated by fitting each lactic acid curve to the Gompertz model and these were fitted to the Arrhenius equation and the energy of activation was calculated. An unusually low value for the energy of activation in biological systems was found (8300 ± 750 cal mol−1). The relatively high dry matter content (45% DM) in cassava silage could impose a type of barrier to diffusion of lactic acid. Local accumulation of lactic acid could affect the evolution of the biological reaction. Thus, this result could be explained by a diffusional limitation of lactic acid in the fermenting mass.

The schools were located in Xalostoc, a highly industrialized area of Mexico City, and San Lorenzo, a suburban area of the city. Although data regarding atmospheric pollution were not available, there is an acknowledged higher level of macroenvironmental air pollution in Xalostoc. Pulmonary function tests were performed on 468 children in San Lorenzo and 405 children in Xalostoc. No differences between residents of the two communities for acute or chronic respiratory conditions were detected by questionnaire. The pulmonary function data demonstrate that boys have larger forced vital capacities (FVC) and forced expiratory flows over the middle half of the FVC (FEF25‐75) than girls. Slopes of regression lines for FVC but not for FEF25‐75 are greater in boys and girls from Xalostoc than in boys and girls from San Lorenzo. This suggests that young children from Xalostoc may experience ill effects of air pollution but develop catch‐up growth later. There were no important community or gender effects on slopes of regression lines for height and weight on age. In general, the regression lines for FVC and FEF25‐75 were below regression lines reported for children of Mexican ancestry living at sea level.

The conditions to perform the test were established as follows: a 2% suspension of polystyrene latex particles (0.8 μm diameter) in 0.15 M glycine buffer pH 8.3 containing 0.2% disodium-EDTA was used to sensitize an equal vlume of antigen at a final antigen concentration between 0.625×-1.25× of the original antigen concentration of the supernatant culture medium. The latex particles were sensitized for 15 min at 56°C, The test, which uses heat-inactivated sera, was performed at room temperature by mixing one drop of each antigen and serum on a glass slide.
