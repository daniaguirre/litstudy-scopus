The uncertainty and insecurity related to the expansion of the metropolis increases the complexity of the harmonization of institutional systems and the integration of local actors and communities to respond to urban planning processes. We address the calls for an examination of local community involvement in governance processes in Milpa Alta (MA), a peri-urban agricultural area in Mexico City (CDMX), a megacity with strong peri-urbanization trends. Livelihoods and adaptive capacities approaches were applied for analysis of the results of surveys, interviews, and participatory workshops. We report that in MA there is no integral adaptive capacity to deal with the effects of urban pressures, regional environmental deterioration, and local agricultural dynamics. There are close linkages between limited participation, low local organizational levels, and the social commitment of the population dedicated to agriculture and the existing distrust of government institutions. Sustainable management of peri-urban areas requires the creation of collaborative networks from which local institutional norms can emerge. Furthermore, peri-urban areas require the establishment of participatory systems for decision-making, including the recovery of community and local councils, to activate processes supportive of achieving peri-urban adaptive governance. We conclude that “local is not enough,” based on an adaptive governance approach, to understand the paradigms of decision-making processes and public and local interests in resource management for agriculture in this peri-urban case study.;adaptive governance | agriculture | livelihoods | Mexico City (CDMX) | peri-urban (PE);0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;297680;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Methods: A two-stage project consisting of a diagnostic scale construction (n1 = 9 for interviews, n2 = 9 for cognitive laboratory) and a validation study with a cross-sectional sample (N = 570) was carried out. Both semi-structured interviews and a cognitive laboratory with nine participants were conducted to obtain DEBM-Q items. DEBM-Q was applied to 570 freshmen male in Mexico City. Psychometric characteristics and internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) were analyzed. An item-total correlation value greater than 0.30 was determined, and factor loads greater than 0.40 were considered valid. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA, n1 = 297) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA, n2 = 273) were performed. Results: Two fixed factors explaining 55.08% of the total variance were extracted. Factor 1, “Drive for Thinness” (8 items), explained 30.84% of the variance, whereas factor 2, “Drive for Muscularity” (8 items), explained 24.23% of the variance. Cronbach’s alpha for the whole questionnaire was 0.84. DEBM-Q was correlated with the Dutch Food Restriction Scale (RS) (r = 0.52, p < 0.001), Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) (r = 0.46, p < 0.001), Emotional Eating Scale (EES) (r = 0.18, p < 0.001), and Negative Affect Subscale (PANAS-X) (r = 0.11, p < 0.005). Conclusion: DEBM-Q is a valid and practical short screening tool (16 items) allowing early identification of disordered eating in young men, thereby facilitating clinical management.

Therefore, we assessed the 1-year incidence of STB among first-year students, a broad range of prospective predictors of STB incidence, and evaluated the prediction accuracy of a baseline multivariate risk prediction model to identify students at highest risk for STB onset over the subsequent 12 months. Methods: Students (n = 3238) from 13 universities in Mexico completed an online survey developed for the World Mental Health International College Student Surveys in their first year and again 12 months after. We ran generalized linear models and receiver operator curves. Results: The 1-year incidence of suicidal ideation, plan and attempt was 8.53%, 3.75%, and 1.16%, respectively. Predictors in final models were female sex (ideation only), minority sexual orientation (ideation only), depression, eating disorders, ADHD (ideation and plan), ongoing arguments or breakup with a romantic partner (ideation only), emotional abuse (ideation only), parental death (ideation, plan), not Catholic/Christian (ideation, plan), not having someone to rely on, psychotic experiences (plan only), and insufficient sleep (attempt only). Prediction accuracy for ideation, plan and attempt was area under the curve = 0.76, 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. Targeting the top 10% of students at highest risk could reduce STB in the subsequent year up to 36%. Conclusions: By assessing these risk/protective factors in incoming students we identified students at greatest risk for developing STB to whom suicide prevention strategies could be targeted.;longitudinal | mental health | Mexico | students | suicide;0;0;;;CONACYT;CB 285548;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

An alternative solution might be the cultivation of microalgae that are efficient in the purification of wastewater, removal of greenhouse gases and production of biomass that can be used for the production of biofuels such as biodiesel, methane, bioethanol, among others. The aim of this work is to cultivate five strains of microalgae native in Mexico: Chlorella miniata, Coelastrella sp., Desmodesmus quadricauda, Neochloris oleoabundans and Verrucodesmus verrucosus. The cultivations were performed using municipal wastewater and a foliar fertilizer with the further purpose of assessing their capacity to produce various types of biomass, in particular lipids. Methods: The experiments were carried out using triplicate 16-L glass bioreactors assays with a 12:12 light–darkness cycle at 25 °C ± 1 under constant aeration. Every 3rd day, a 1-mL sample was taken to determine cell density. In the stationary growth phase, each culture was harvested by sedimentation and lipid content analysis was performed. The biomass with the highest concentration of total lipids was subjected to an analysis of the methyl esters of fatty acids. Results: An ANOVA test showed significant differences between the growth rates (F = 6.8, p = 0.0001). The species that were able to produce biomass with the highest concentrations of total lipids were Coelastrella sp. with 44–46%; Verrucodesmus verrucosus with 43–44% and Neochloris oleoabundans 35–37%. As the analysis of the methyl esters of fatty acids showed, the species Coelastrella sp. and V. verrucosus produced lipids composed of 82.9% and 91.28% of fatty acids, respectively, containing C16–C18 carbon chains. Conclusions: All the species used in the present study were able to grow on wastewater and produce high concentrations of lipids. Therefore, the demands for biodiesel production could be met in the immediate future after continuing working with different microalgae species. Therefore, it is necessary to determine their adaptation potential to grow on contaminated effluents and produce lipids that can be used for the benefit of people and environment.";Biodiesel from microalgae | Coelastrella sp | Phycoremediation | Verrucodesmus verrucosus | Wastewater treatment with microalgae;2;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;UAM;undefined;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

Induction and maintenance of this state requires the coordinated functioning of various cortical and subcortical areas. The medial prefrontal (mPFC, the prelimbic area in rats) and posterior parietal cortices (pPC) form an attentional network involved in processing incentive stimuli. Given that the sexual incentive stimuli emitted by a receptive female are highly relevant for the male rat, it is probable that these cortices interact functionally in processing the sexual stimuli that produce SM. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize the cortical activation and degree of electroencephalographic coupling (coherence, hEEG) between the mPFC and pPC during a sexually-motivated state in male rats. Only rats that reached this state after 1 intromission prior to EEG recording, presented a higher frequency and duration of nose pokes, and showed higher prefronto-parietal activation and EEG synchronization while close to an inaccessible receptive female. Results show that both cortices are activated and that they are functionally coupled during the processing of sexually-relevant stimuli mainly in the right hemisphere, a key condition for inducing SM. We conclude that the attentional network made up of the prefrontal and parietal cortices participates in the adequate attention to, and processing of, sexual incentive stimuli and, hence, in inducing SM in male rats.;EEG | Parietal cortex | Prefrontal cortex | Rats | Sexual motivation;0;0;;;;undefined;

In order to achieve this, potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) is used as a heterogeneous pseudo-catalyst in the transesterification reaction of two different vegetable oils: refined soybean oil (SBO) and crude Jatropha curcas L. oil (JCO). Transesterification variables are optimized using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) to maximize the oil conversion to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Process variables such as stirring rate (125–700 RPM), K2FeO4 dosage (0.15–6 wt%), and methanol to oil molar ratio (6:1 to 16:1) are varied to obtain maximum conversion. The experimental results revealed that maximum conversion of 98.17% and 98.35% are produced in 1 h using the optimized conditions determined with the response surface methodology (RSM) for JCO (357 RPM, 5.29 wt% K2FeO4 dosage, 14.89:1 MeOH: oil molar ratio) and SBO (700 RPM, 4.82 wt% K2FeO4 dosage, 14.28:1 MeOH: oil molar ratio), respectively. The conversion percentage is quantified by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and corroborated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR). The fatty acid methyl esters produced under optimized reaction conditions are characterized to obtain their density, viscosity, acid number, oxidative stability, flash point, heating value, cloud point, and pour point to determine the quality compliance with the standard ASTM D6751. Additionally, conversion percentage is monitored at 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min of reaction. It is found that after 5 min of transesterification reaction, a conversion of 98.31% is reached without significant variation over time using SBO. A similar conversion (98.07%) is generated at 30 min for JCO, reaching its maximum conversion (98.65%) at 90 min. These fast reactions might occur due to the methoxy radicals formed on K2FeO4, unlike the methoxy ions produced by other heterogeneous catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) spectroscopy are used to characterize the K2FeO4 material.;Biodiesel | Heterogeneous catalysis | Jatropha curcas L. oil | K FeO 2 4 | Methoxy radical | Soybean oil;0;0;;;CONACYT;315787;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The sustainable index is more vulnerable to the foreign exchange market and to the U.S. stock market, especially in periods of turbulence. Only the S&P 500 shows a statistically significant impact on the overall Mexican index, for both states high and low volatility. Oil prices do not have a significant impact on the Mexican indices analyzed. Evidence allows us to recommend a currency hedging in ESG investments. Originality relies on empirical approaches and the study of ESG index in an emerging market. Limitations are related with the scarce information and limited access to ESG factors data. We conclude that investment strategies should be different during calm and turmoil periods.;ESG Index | Mexican Bourse | Poor’s 500 | Standard | Stock Markets;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

However, achieving this goal has become challenging, especially in megacities. Mexico City registers 94% coverage of water supply, according to the 2020 Population and Housing Census. In 2019, per capita water consumption was 123 l/day, a supply reasonable as it is above the 100 l/day recommended by the World Health Organization to guarantee optimal access to water. However, water consumption among households is characterized by a heterogeneous spatial distribution that denotes a great inequity. The objective of this research is to evaluate the configuration of the spatial patterns that define the differences in water consumption in Mexico City's households, as well as their association with possible causal factors. This task was carried out through the spatial analysis and the use of geographic information systems. The water consumption records correspond to the year 2019 and were provided by the city's operating utility. Results confirmed the existence of two clusters of households whose location highlight areas where inequality in water consumption is present. The clusters are explained by the interaction of four factors, in order of importance: discontinuous water supply; dependence on external water sources; altitude; and the socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods. The results provide a fundamental basis for the development of water policies to mitigate inequality. Also, a methodological approach is provided to investigate water problems in large cities in developing countries, where the available literature is scarce.";Domestic water consumption | Mexico City | Spatial analysis | Water spatial inequality;0;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;CONACYT;959;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In this study, we aimed to examine the interaction between cognitive and emotional components through functional connectivity analyzes and to explore gender differences for the recruitment and interaction of these components. Thirty-six healthy participants (21–56 years; 21 women) were exposed to social images in an fMRI session to judge whether the stimuli elicited compassion. The results showed a different connectivity pattern for women and men of the insular cortex, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the cingulate cortex. The integration of affective and cognitive components follows a complex functional connectivity pattern that is different for both genders. These differences may indicate that men largely make compassionate judgments based on contextual information, while women tend to notably take internal and introspective processes into account. Women and men can use different affective and cognitive routes that could converge in similar learning of moral values, empathic experiences and compassionate acts.";compassion | empathy | functional connectivity | gender differences | moral;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;IN203216;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The incursion of oral history and social history, allows researchers a philosophical-epistemological reflection to approach the concrete totality, going from the sensible concrete, to the concrete thought, with the narratives of the protagonists through two life stories; one of them, that of a teacher with a long experience of struggle in favor of collective rights, from the organized social resistance; the other, is that of a teacher who balances from the canons of submission to hegemony. Both show subjectivity as the fundamental element to understand the paths through which health and illness are expressed and also allow to give way to an alternative to define healthy spaces where the emancipation of human capacities in the collectives to move towards health is propitiated and promoted.

Poorest households in the Tupiza watershed in Bolivia are located in rural areas where water access for irrigation and safe drinking water is becoming increasingly scarce. Small-scale unregulated mining offers an alternative for revenue making in rural households, although wastewater from industry threatens water quality and new technologies to reduce water pollution are not implemented in this region yet. This study analyses water access and poverty linkages using the Multidimensional Poverty Analysis (MDPA) framework from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) to guide a survey and to develop indicators using the Shapley-Owen decomposition method and multivariate regressions. A set of household-level policies were included to predict the influence of these policies on poverty reduction estimates. Results have shown that remote communities in rural areas have the lowest value of multidimensional poverty and for some of these communities mining activities represent an alternative that could be considered if their water access conditions worsen over time. While mining can bring better monetary benefits, it can cause the degradation of ecological flows from the produced wastewater. Under the current technologies and processes, it can pose negative impacts on water quality and threatens the public health of these communities.;communities | multidimensional poverty | regression | Shapley-Owen method | vulnerability | water access;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;Sida;11972;Styrelsen för Internationellt Utvecklingssamarbete

Through an inter/transdisciplinary research framework, we addressed the model’s role in the sustainability of this socio-ecosystem concerning four significant drivers of the wetland’s transformation. The CRM has improved water quality locally, increased the suitable habitat for native aquatic biodiversity, and supported traditional agroecological practices, thus improving the quality and safety of food products. However, there are clear challenges regarding production and commercialization, some of which may be addressed through the strengthening of the social organization and collective action. However, other challenges are beyond the reach of chinampa producers’ efforts and the CRM, but are decisive in changing the degradation trends.

In accordance with this, the present review is focused on recent advances in developing nanomaterial-based sensors for glyphosate detection. Reported data from the literature concerning glyphosate detection in the different matrices using analytical methods (mostly chromatographic techniques) are presented; however, they are expensive and time-consuming. In this sense, nanosensors’ potential applications are explained to establish their advantages over traditional glyphosate detection methods. Zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three- dimensional (3D) materials are reviewed, from biomolecules to metallic compounds. Bionanomaterials have generated research interest due to their selectivity with respect to using enzymes, DNA, or antibodies. On the other hand, Quantum Dots also are becoming relevant for their vast surface area and good limit of detection values (in the range of pM). This review presents all the characteristics and potential applications of different nanomaterials for sensor development, bearing in mind the necessity of a glyphosate detection method with high sensitivity, selectivity, and portability.";glyphosate | herbicide | nanomaterials | sensor | water-detection;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;364335;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Using a case study from one of Mexico's most productive onshore natural gas fields, the Burgos Basin, we link contract literatures in geography and critical legal scholarship to answer the following two questions: Does the contract text correspond to how private companies access state-owned subsurface resources, and what purposes do the contracts serve for the contract signatories beyond resource production? The data suggest that contract winners have, so far, limited their drilling activities on the Burgos Basin. This situation draws attention to a puzzle wherein natural gas reserves are not being produced, but the contracts remain active and important to both the contractors and the government. Putting semi-structured interview data into direct conversation with contract text to answer our research questions, we encourage a deeper engagement with how extractive contracts are used to access state-owned resources. First, we uncover how the contract text is not instructive of how or why a private firm will access the resource or why the state enters the contract. Second, we highlight the ways that the contract fails to actualize resource production using a mechanisms of access approach to guide our analysis. Third, we show that resource contracts facilitate relationships and advance the interests of the contract parties regardless of what the actual text purports to do. We finally describe how state-firm resource contracts offer a fruitful area of exploration for geographers interested in resource production.;Legal studies | Mechanisms of access | Mexican energy reforms | Public–private partnerships | Relational contract theory | Resource becoming;0;0;;;;undefined;

This gap in the research warrants a greater understanding of the current state of pre-service teacher training for primary education in Mexico through an examination of both local and international literature. The results were organized into five spheres of analysis: professional, educational policy, institution and instructional traditions, curricular, and subjects. After discussing these, we can confirm that the design of educational policies and curricula modifications in pre-service teacher training for primary education require diagnostics and discussions around, among others, the status of the teaching profession, the kind of institutions that offer it and their predominant pedagogical traditions, the prevailing international recommendations, the corps of teacher trainers, and the students who choose teaching as a career path, all towards the creation of actions that consider all the components and subjects involved.;initial training | Mexico | primary education | teacher education | teachers;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Methodology: the econometric test of structural change from Chow (1960) is implemented. The periods to be analyzed are two six-year terms: the first prior to the RE, under the administration of President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, and the second when the RE of President Enrique Peña Nieto is implemented. Data: Monthly data from the National Institute of Statistic and Geography (INEGI for its acronym in Spanish) is used for the period 2006-2016. The empirical results suggest the absence of a structural change between the two six-year periods analyzed. Apparently the RE did not achieve the objectives analyzed here. Novelty: No previous studies with econometric analysis have been found to evaluate the structural change that RE supposes in Mexico. Therefore, the analysis proposed in this document is novel. Limitations: This research is limited to studying the objectives of the RE concerning an increase in oil production and a decrease in the price of gasoline. Other objectives of the RE are outside the scope of this document. Further analysis could benefit from the introduction of other objectives.;Energy reform | gasoline prices | Mexico | oil production | structural change;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

In the ""National-socialist"" case, those limits are the declining demand, the increase in government debt and the inhibition of the productive investment of capital.

As Hannah Arendt has shown, it has brought about a veritable cosmic shift in our perspective as a species, allowing us to step outside of the terrestrial limit that seemed to constitute the human condition. Nevertheless, Arendt’s description of the power of science has as its counterpoint a conceptualization of evil as an incapacity or refusal to think, especially to think from the perspective of someone else – what she called “banal evil”. Given the importance of the scientific enterprise in our own destiny, and also the turmoil in which our world is in recent times, it seems necessary to ask: is it possible that scientific practices have a relationship with banal evil? Here we explore the possible relationship between them, as well as the ways in which this question points to another possible science, a science that can be accountable and responsible for its own actions.;Banality of Evil | Earth Alienation | Hannah Arendt | Scientific Responsibility | Thoughtlessness | Unlimited Knowledge;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Firstly, the argument starts from the idea that violence, in a hegelian perspective, can be convertible in Institution, Morality or Reason. Nevertheless, this idea will be worked on and questioned through all our article. Secondly, we explore different ways in which inconvertible violence is indeed possible, and that is the moment when it turns to extreme violence. Our article observes two inseparable and continuous scenes of extreme violence as: ultra objective violence and ultra subjective violence. Finally, we deepen the idea about how ultra subjective violence is associated with phantasy, imagination and desire of annihilation of alterity. It is suggested also how political practice is a moment of interruption inside this continuum of extreme violence, which always haunts the conditions of possibility of politics itself.;Desire | Dialectic | Extreme Violence | Imagination | Violence;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

He considers that Hitlerism is an awakening of elementary feelings, feelings are an intersection of specific intentional acts. Thus, the philosophy of Hitlerism would be an expression of the modes of being-there-in-the-world, it is a mode of existence. Elemental evil establishes a relationship in which the subject is chained to himself. In later writings elemental evil seems to be linked with a complex development of Western metaphysics. This article intends to study how Levinasian phenomenological criticism is capable of suspending elemental evil, trying to dismantle Western politics through the foundation of a phenomenological politics that conceives another relationship.;Affective Tonality | Chaining | Elemental Evil | Other | Phenomenological Politics;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

This scenario was unfavorable for an industry that was beginning to reconfigure itself within the framework of a secondary export model. Analysis was conducted using a Markov regime switching model and an Error Correction Vector Model (ECVM).

Urban blue spaces are critical for biodiversity, provide a range of ecosystem services, and can promote human health and wellbeing. Despite this, access to blue space is often unequally distributed across socioeconomic gradients, and the availability of quality blue space could extend to environmental justice issues. Three stages of analysis were carried out in Mexico City, Mexico and Bristol, UK to (i) assess associations between blue space and socioeconomic metrics at a regional scale, (ii) apply a rapid assessment tool to assess amenity, access and environmental quality, (iii) consider local quality across socioeconomic gradients at a regional scale. Still water availability was indicative of higher socioeconomic status, but contrasting city evolutions underpinned differences. Locally, there were environmental gradients from more complex to disturbed habitats that influenced potential wellbeing and amenity benefits. In combination, this may exacerbate inequalities and risk increasing ecosystem disservices. If cities are to be socially, and environmentally resilient to higher levels of disturbance in the future, healthy ecosystems will be key. However, further research is needed to address various dimensions of injustice in urban areas beyond blue space distribution.;Blue spaces | Freshwater distribution | Freshwater network | Habitat quality | Urban landscapes;0;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;ES/S006443/1;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The scoping literature review conducted found 120 publications that address stakeholder participation in decision-making and the economic benefits generated in Mexican BRs. Only 65 of those studies were published in indexed journals, while national outlets accounted for the other 55, most of them also peer-reviewed publications. International papers differ from national ones regarding spatial coverage, research foci, and the methods applied.

To face the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, librarians in these institutions improved their Information Literacy (IL) and Media Information Literacy (MIL) programmes. Design / methodology / approach This study has a mixed methodology with a comparative analysis. For this purpose, data shows the universities’ contexts: the communities of students, teachers, researchers, and librarians, and the e-learning strategies of IL and MIL programmes. Findings As part of the results of the crowdsourcing collaboration between the UMD, UNAM and BUAP, the study shows the different online learning communities and their innovations. Originality Although there is theoretical knowledge about IL and MIL in Mexican universities and University of Minnesota Duluth, the e-learning strategies used by their librarians in this document sought to provide technical solutions and other options for a virtual work scheme that responded to the specific problems presented by COVID-19. In this case, the framework for creating online library services was designed by their librarians for their communities in the context of the current crisis, even when online services had already been established for more than ten years. Research limitations / implications The technological infrastructure, the professionalisation of the library staff and a lack of knowledge of the new virtual teaching-learning needs. Practical implications Analysis of tools for virtual teaching-learning services, description of strategies used by library staff, results and feedback. Social implications IL and MIL strategies created in a variety of contexts can be enhanced by library collaboration in a fully virtual setting.

Nevertheless, one may wish to consider time-branching in order to discuss future possibilities. One can have both a linear order for the time and branching through the combination of the tense logic semantics with those of an alethic logic which allows the evaluation of the timelines of other possible worlds. In this paper, I give the semantics and the tableaux systems for some alethic-tense logics. I review one in which worlds differ on their time orders (MT), another in which they agree on the time order (MOT), a pair of conditional tense logics (CT, CT+), and the first-order version of MT.

We consider eviction to be one of the least addressed problems in urban studies, but one that exhibits great strength for discussing the issues of housing and the city from a feminist perspective. We hypothesize that this is an expulsion not only of women, but of racialized women. Gathering concepts of eviction, mobility, and immobility, “racial banishment”, gentrification and others, and through a qualitative investigation that reconstructs the stories of eviction and displacement collected through interviews with women from the “Eviction Network of Mexico City”, we offer emotional and embodied texture to these abstract urban processes. In this context, the findings show how ethnic-racial issues intersect and produce specific gendered effects. At the same time, we pinpoint how forced displacement can be understood from the perspective of mobility and immobility, where aspects such as access to the city and insecurity are very sensitive for women, and finally, we address how to understand the experience of eviction from an emotional perspective.;displacement | gender | gentrification | housing | racial banishment;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The methodological strategy is mixed, as it puts in dialogue qualitative and quantitative research techniques, a mobility survey, and mobile ethnographies with women in their daily movements. The study context was three Modal Transfer Centers in Mexico City. The main conclusions show how caregiving practices can be present in the daily journeys of women living in the Mexican capital and that transportation territories and infrastructures can be understood as spaces for caregiving that shape the experiences of caregiving on the move. In this sense, investigating landscapes of care entails making visible realities that otherwise go unnoticed, as these landscapes are present in daily journeys -principally of women- through the city, though other inhabitants may not be aware of them or observe them directly.";care | gender | landscape | mobility | spaces | transport;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

It is found that for both the first period and the whole period there is evidence of weak convergence, on the contrary, evidence of divergence is revealed for the second period. The application of this test to groups formed on the basis of their income levels helps to identify whether some of these groups may be responsible for the lack of convergence of all the states.

We used journalistic news showing real-life situations to investigate the effects of facing violence over the experience of four moral emotions which represent powerful impulses for social actions in situations of suffering linked to violence: Negative Compassion, Positive Compassion, Schadenfreude, and Indignation. We evaluate brain activation by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during three cognitive conditions: reading, introspection, and resting. When reading the news, only Indignation-evoking stimuli elicited salient brain activations in the posterior cerebellum, and temporal and parietal cortical regions, whose functions are related to anger experiences and processing of socially relevant circumstances. When introspecting the emotional experience, cerebellar, frontal, parietal, and occipital activations related to self-focused experiences were observed for all emotions. When resting after facing the stimuli, only the Negative Compassion emotion elicited brain activations in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus related to emotional self-reference processing; thus, negative compassion may produce more perdurable cognitive-affective effects related to sadness while perceiving suffering in others. Our results may suggest different emotional-based social decisions to face suffering and violence and to motivate pro-social actions in the collectivistic Mexican culture.";compassion | fMRI | Indignation | Moral emotions | Schadenfreude;2;0;;;UNAM;undefined;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

Social media has become a common way of exchanging information; therefore, we proposed to use it as a tool for exploring beer-food pairing and eating behavior. Twitter and Instagram were selected as they are among the most popular platforms. Although texts from Twitter could provide an accurate verbal description of consumer's food experiences, Instagram could offer the possibility of exploring the consumption context through images, leading to a better understanding of consumers' eating behavior, with a focus on food and beverage combinations. We hypothesize that images from Instagram will provide further information than texts from Twitter, regarding beer-food pairing and consumption context. A social media study was performed in Mexico comparing texts vs. images, selected from a one-year period, and manually classified through content analysis. Foods extracted from images and texts were categorized into frequencies and analyzed using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and hierarchical clustering (AHC). MCA showed the most frequently mentioned foods paired with beer for each platform. Data extracted from images and texts about consumption context was also analyzed and categorized into frequencies according to several themes: consumption behavior, type of consumption, way of beer consumption, place of consumption, and consumption occasion. Data extracted from the two platforms was compared by using a chi-square test per theme. Several differences were found, depending on the social media platform, texts being the one with less extracted and meaningful information. In general, while texts provided less extracted and meaningful information, images offered more details regarding beer-food pairing and context of consumption, the same as beer information such as type, color, brand, and style. Overall, images gave more information on beer-food pairing compared to texts. The methods and results from this paper could be applied by culinary professionals, sommeliers, and researchers in the gastronomy and food and hospitality areas.";Beer | Context of consumption | Food pairing | Instagram | Social media | Twitter;1;0;;;CONACYT;314318;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The information obtained from 64 interviews with members of the six cooperatives that operate in the study area revealed how the Mexican civil association that promoted this certification initiative placed its own economic interests above conservationist arguments, and how its actions generated problems by (i) excluding diverse local fishers from the design and instrumentation of the certification, and (ii) producing unequal economic benefits for the organizations and localities where this activity is practiced. The study demonstrates that fishing certifications proposed from the Global South (Southern Certifications) can reproduce problems of legitimacy similar to those that conventional certifications (pragmatic legitimacy) confront, with scant benefits for small-scale, artisanal fisheries in developing countries. We conclude that constructing moral (i.e., a balance between strong and weak networks) and cognitive (i.e., sociocultural proximity) legitimacy is crucial for instrumenting certifications that will be more effective in attending to the socioeconomic and environmental challenges of fishing in specific territorial contexts.;Cognitive legitimacy | Local participation | Moral legitimacy | Pragmatic legitimacy | Southern environmental certifications | Territoriality;1;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

To explore this issue, we consider the institutional mechanisms of participation from above expressed in the legislation of Mexico, Ecuador and Peru, as well as diverse experiences of community resistance against extractive projects in the same countries. Our analysis illustrates that state decision-making and stewardship over strategic and non-renewable natural resources remains unchallenged although participatory mechanisms are assumed as instruments for affected communities to shape decision-making over extractive projects. Our findings also indicate that large mobilizations, legal actions, calls for binding consultation, and forms of blockades are used to successfully shape decision-making. Whilst these actions from below obtain certain achievements, they are only temporarily successful as long-term decisions surrounding extractive governance and underlying structural inequalities remain unaffected. Though actors resisting extractive projects are possibly aware of this limited effect in the short-term, we suggest that their mobilization could create a path for questioning political participation outside the existing structural constraints for questioning established social orders and building emancipatory tools.;Consent | Decision-making | Extractivism | Latin America | Participation;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Such environmental phenomena trigger sediment loss, which is known as scour. If maintenance actions are not taken after scouring events, the scour depth increases over time until the bridge collapses. A methodology to estimate the scour hazard considering both the scour–fill interaction and the Monte Carlo simulation method is proposed. The general extreme value probability distribution is used to characterize the intensity of the scouring events, the lognormal distribution is used to characterize the sedimentation process (fill), and a homogeneous Poisson process is used to forecast the occurrence of both types of events. Based on the above, several histories of scour–fill depths are made; such simulations are then used to develop time-dependent scour hazard curves.

We employ the concept of socially productive knowledge and use this lens to reflect on the searches carried out by groups of relatives of the disappea-red. How should family members use new knowledge to carry out their searches? These ways of knowing are at times through formal channels, and at other times not. Family members and collectives generate their own geographies of pain and terror, they place them-selves in the territories to look for human remains, and they learn to decipher signs of context. In the deployment of this knowledge, the management of space, territory and local context is important.;Enforced disappearances | sear-ching process | subaltern knowledge | territory | victims;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The econometric evidence, based on the Arellano-Bond generalized method of moments, shows that: 1) education raises tfp, which suggests that highly qualified workers are more able to develop new technologies and absorb existing technologies, 2) oil rents lower tfp, which is consistent with the natural resource curse (nrc) hypothesis and, therefore, with the view that rent-seeking and corruption prevent some oil-rich nations from prospering, and 3) the interaction term involving oil rents and institutional development yields a positive effect on tfp, which means that imposing the rule of law, eradicating corruption, and improving regulatory quality can effectively contribute to reversing the negative effect of oil abundance on tfp.;education | institutional development | oil rents | Total factor productivity;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

In some cases, those directional variables are only defined in subsets of the K-dimensional unit sphere. For example, in some applications, angles as measured responses are limited on the positive orthant. Analysis on subsets of the K-dimensional unit sphere is challenging and nowadays there are not many proposals that discuss this topic. Thus, from a methodological point of view, it is important to have probability distributions defined on bounded subsets of the K-dimensional unit sphere. Specifically, in this paper, we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian model to describe directional variables restricted to the first orthant. This model is based on a Dirichlet process mixture model with multivariate projected Gamma densities as kernel distributions. We show how to carry out inference for the proposed model based on a slice sampling scheme. The proposed methodology is illustrated using simulated data sets as well as a real data set.;circular data | Dirichlet process mixture | Multivariate projected gamma distribution | spherical data;0;0;;;;undefined;

A cross-sectional study was carried out in 20 universities in Yucatan and 9,366 students were surveyed using validated questionnaires built into a smartphone app, applying partial least squares structural equation models. High suicide risk was assessed in 10.8% of the sample. Clinically relevant depression and anxiety levels were found in 6.6% and 10.5% of the sample, respectively, and 67.8% reported high well-being. Comparably higher levels of suicide risk, depression and anxiety, and lower well-being were found in women, who were also somewhat older than men in our study. Furthermore, path analysis in the structural equation model revealed that depression was the main predictor of suicidal behaviour as well as of higher anxiety levels and lower self-perceived well-being in the total sample and in both genders. Our findings draw attention to the association between suicidality, depression, anxiety, and well-being in Yucatan young adults and gender differences with this regard.

Findings: Findings suggest that ARFIMA-HYGARCH is the best model to analyze BTC volatility, and ARFIMA-FIGARCH is the best approach to model ETH volatility. Empirical evidence also confirms the existence of long memory on returns and on BTC volatility parameters. Results evidence that the models proposed are not as suitable for modeling ETH volatility as they are for the BTC. Originality/value: Findings allow to confirm the fractal market hypothesis in BTC market. The data confirm that, despite the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, the dynamics of BTC returns, and volatility maintained their patterns, i.e. the way in which they evolve, in relation to the prepandemic era, did not change, but it is rather reaffirmed. Yet, ETH conditional volatility was more affected, as it is apparently higher during Covid-19.

In the first instance, the text discusses the concept of architectural copy, taking into account the constructive characteristics of this example. In a second moment, a detailed study is made of the construction phases of this temple, initially a humble chapel product of the Cristero conflict that in the mid-eighties of the 20th century was remodeled in neo-Gothic style taking the aforementioned Parisian church as a model to be copied. The temple that is still under construction will be promoted by the Leonese priest José María de la Torre and was designed and built by the architect Guillermo Chávez Ochoa, who will also carry out part of the sculptural decoration. This is a description that for the first time documents this Mexican temple and reveals the importance of the promoters and builders of this type of churches, who in many cases remain in public anonymity. A temple, certainly peculiar because it is a reinterpretation of a French Gothic temple, but it must be framed among the many examples of neo-Gothic architecture that exist in Mexico and that need to be documented, since today they are a remarkable Mexican architectural heritage.;architectural reinterpretation | church | medieval | neo-gothic;0;0;;;;undefined;

For countries such as Colombia, the rental housing segment represents the housing solution for half of the population, a condition that has been strengthened in the last five years with the massive immigration of Ve-nezuelans to the country’s main urban centers. In Bogota, the high demand for rental housing in informal neighborhoods has stimulated the price of rents to rise, favoring landlords and, indirectly, the low-income housing market. This article seeks to expose the difficulties experienced by Venezuelan immigrant families in their search for rental housing in the city’s informal neighborhoods where the cost of living may be more affordable, but they must face the lack of price regulation, as well as segregation and discrimination based on their country of origin, experiencing not only violence and discrimination by State institutions, but also the stigmatization of the inha-bitants of equally segregated neighborhoods.;Bogotá | housing | rent | Venezuelan migration;0;0;;;;undefined;

Our empirical results are in line with Marx’s theoretical framework: the level of employment grows with the expansion of fixed capital stock and reduces with increases in the productivity of labour.";accumulation of capital | ARIMAX | employment level | productivity of labour;0;0;;;;undefined;

However, alternatives are necessary when situations arise where it is impossible to have a chemistry laboratory. Conducting home experiments can be of great help in teaching various chemistry topics, as they can be used in tasks, research scenarios, and alternative laboratory practices. They can be applied to different levels of teaching depending on their orientation and the contents they address. In the absence of a laboratory to conduct chemistry practice experiments due to Covid-19 faculty and student confinements at home, we developed feasible practices to do at home with ordinary homemade materials that were not risky or dangerous. We selected solutions with desired colligative properties. Thirty engineering students taking two university chemistry laboratory classes participated, coming from programs in the chemical area such as chemical engineering and biotechnology engineering, among others. The teaching-learning process was conducted remotely via Zoom. The students appreciated the in-home practices. Motivated to understand the topics, they performed well on the exams and the laboratory reports and issued high opinions of the classes in the student survey.;colligative properties | Concentration | educational innovation | higher education | solutions;0;0;;;ITESM;undefined;Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey

Enterprises need to respond quickly to the needs of their customers and stakeholders and by adopting agile practices in IT teams, business value is raised in both performance and quality, so it is important to adopt practices and models that ensure the time, scope and cost of a project are achieved successfully. This paper presents a hybrid effort estimation model that uses a story point approach with machine learning techniques to estimate completion time and total cost of a project that is developed with agile methods like Scrum. The main machine learning technique used to implement the project is the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN), its learning capabilities are assessed through 10-Fold cross validation and the estimates are compared with the original dataset and the results obtained from literature to show that estimates are competitive. The proposed approach uses category size labels that improve the original estimation model based on linear regression. The research uses 21 projects developed by six software houses, and training is done on a set created from a technique called data augmentation that generates 42 projects with a small amount of noise. Completion time is measured in days and total cost is valued in Pakistan rupees. All the results are evaluated through accuracy, Mean Squared Error, Mean Relative Error, variance and coefficient of determination.;cost | Effort | estimation | KNN | machine learning | supervised | time;0;0;;;;undefined;

Based on Bloomberg and EMIS, the financial statements of 1,548 firms from 2017 to 2020 were used to build three panel data analysis models with fixed effects, one per sector. The findings show a negative relationship between profitability and retained earnings with level of indebtedness in the agricultural and tourism and food sectors. They also indicate that the level of indebtedness of the tourism and food sector increased with the economic crisis generated by COVID-19, while it decreased in the agricultural sector. The conclusions suggest that in these two sectors there is a hierarchy of preferences, but not so in the transport and storage sector, where only a negative relationship with profitability is observed.;agricultural economics | capital structure | debt level | gross domestic product | Pecking Order Theory | tourism | transport;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Achieving national determined contributions signed as part of the Paris Agreement depends on the power of national and subnational governments to implement effective CC policies. Using a framework based on three power categories: power by design, pragmatic power, and framing power, we analyse how different types of power across multiple levels of government entities operate within various sectors in an emerging economy. Specifically, we analyse the multilevel governance in Mexico’s federal system. Our sample comprises six states (out of 32) and 18 municipalities and considers two mitigation sectors (transport and urban solid waste) and the adaptation domain. We find evidence of more robust climate policy at the state level delivered through power by design (policy instruments) and pragmatic power (to implement actions), but weak power performance at the municipal level. The sectoral analysis shows more consistent adaptation policies than mitigation policies. The power imbalances across the three categories are relevant because the quantity and coherence of designed policy instruments and actions can be contrasted with the capacity to implement actions, which depends on the availability of resources and political will.;climate change | Mexico | multilevel governance | power | sectoral performance | subnational governments;0;0;;;;undefined;

However, those related to insomnia associated with mood disorders remain understudied, even though insomnia is more severe in the presence of comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to determine the direct and indirect costs of insomnia associated with depression and anxiety disorders (DAD) from the perspective of the patient in a private healthcare system. This was an observational study of chronic insomnia associated with DAD at a private Sleep Disorders Clinic in Mexico City between 2019 and 2020. Patients were followed for up to one year. Healthcare resource utilization data were collected through clinical records. Direct and indirect costs associated with insomnia treatment were estimated through micro-costing. The estimated economic burden was projected to 5 years adjusting for inflation and discounting future costs. A deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed. The median cost of the first year of insomnia treatment associated with DAD was US$3537.57 per patient. The work productivity loss represented the highest economic burden (63.84%) followed by direct medical costs (28.32%), and the direct non-medical costs (7.85%). The estimated annual economic burden for patients treated in the private healthcare system in Mexico was US$293 million. The costs of insomnia associated with DAD at a private clinic in México were found to be high. The burden of the costs faced by these patients is substantial relative to the median income of the population.

Mexican agriculture includes a successful agro-export sector of large producers with high productive and financial capacity, as well as a vast sector of small subsistence producers that has been left out of government policies that guarantee not only their survival but also their well-being. The challenges of agricultural and food sustainability include not only the economic well-being of the inhabitants but also the safeguarding of traditional agricultural systems, territories and their natural resources, livelihoods, rural regional cultures, and land use. Promotion of regional food-production systems is identified as the axis of a new agricultural system supported by agri-food research policies. To identify guidelines for this regional approach, we first developed a catalog of issues and changes in food production. In addition, we illustrate how Mexican traditional agroecosystems improve regional food-production systems and make them applicable in the case of Mexico. By evaluating these factors, we provide some useful insights on the importance of the agriculture-food nexus within a sustainable development context.;Agriculture-food nexus | Dietary patterns | Mexico | Regional food-production systems | Traditional agroecosystems;0;0;;;;undefined;

In this paper, we introduce a Bert-based language model, pre-trained on 430,000 Odia sentences. We also evaluate the model on the well-known Kaggle Odia news classification dataset (BertOdia: 96%, RoBERTaOdia: 92%, and ULMFit: 91.9% classification accuracy), and perform a comparison study with multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) supporting Odia.

This implies that they can apprehend individual forms, i.e., substances. However, substance is not sensible in itself. Although incidental perception accounts for the connection between intellectual and sensible properties, the question remains how intellect-lacking animals can perceive individual things. Avicenna advances an inner-sense theory to explain how animals interact with individuals without perceiving substance. Averroes’s belief that the human senses grasp the intentio individualis, i.e., the individual substantial form, presupposes that animal and human senses are different. Albert the Great’s solution, in his Commentary on the De anima, retains Averroes’s intentio individualis but agrees with Avicenna’s claim that rational and non-rational animals share identical sensitive apparatuses. Albert arrives at his solution in three main steps. First, he redefines the concept of abstraction from Avicenna’s Liber de anima, part II, chapter 2, to separate the individual thing from its signification, i.e., its intention. Secondly, he applies his forma totius theory asserting that each of the five Porphyrian universals can be predicated of an individual thing because they refer to the totality of that thing. Thirdly, he uses the concept of praedicatio per se tertio modo from Posterior Analytics to argue that the Porphyrian universal accident refers to the totality of an individual thing. The resulting theory makes it possible to explain how the senses can apprehend the individual thing qua individual without the necessity of perceiving its substance.;Albert the Great | Averroes | Avicenna | Intentionality | Sense Perception;0;0;;;;undefined;

However, this article only talks about Drivers-Pressures-State directly related to water availability. Drivers are the water requirements for urban-public use, agricultural use, industrial use, and other uses. Pressures are changes in surface water bodies and increased agricultural frontier. Finally, indicators of State are water balance and water availability. The analysis results show that even though the Usumacinta River is one of the largest rivers in Mexico and Central America, the municipalities within the basin have a deficit in their local water availability.;Consumption of water | Transboundary basin | Water availability | Water balance;0;0;;;;undefined;

The inhibition of Aβ aggregation has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for AD. Pristine C60 has shown the capacity to interact with the Aβ peptide and interfere with fibril formation but induces significant toxic effects in vitro and in vivo. Objective: To evaluate the potential of a series of C60 multiadducts to inhibit the Aβ fibrillization. Methods: A series of C60 multiadducts with four to six diethyl malonyl and their corresponding disodium-malonyl substituents were synthesized as individual isomers. Their potential on Aβ fibrillization inhibition was evaluated in vitro, in cellulo, and silico. Antioxidant activity, acetylcholinesterase inhibition capacity, and toxicity were assessed in vitro. Results: The multiadducts modulate Aβ fibrils formation without inducing cell toxicity, and that the number and polarity of the substituents play a significant role in the adducts efficacy to modulate Aβ aggregation. The molecular mechanism of fullerene-Aβ interaction and modulation was identified. Furthermore, the fullerene derivatives exhibited antioxidant capacity and reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity. Conclusion: Multiadducts of C60 are novel multi-target-directed ligand molecules that could hold considerable promise as the starting point for the development of AD therapies.;Alzheimer's disease | fullerenes | molecular dynamics | nanoparticles | polymerization | therapy;1;0;;;CONACYT;319328;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

To achieve this purpose, ARDL and NARDL models are proposed to measure the sector index response to EMV index. To examine which categories of EMV trackers most influence the dynamics of each sector index, an artificial neural network is employed. Findings suggest that there is a symmetric, negative, and significant impact of the EMV on all sector indexes. Energy, materials, and financials are the sectors most sensitive to changes in EMV. The ANN results demonstrate that EMV Categorical Trackers describe accurately the sector indexes return. Although each sector reacts to different categories, the factors that affect two or more sectors are: commodity markets, financial regulation, exchange rates, and trade policy.;"Equity market | S&amp;P 500 Indexes";0;0;;;;undefined;

The short position of the European put option is to minimize energy costs and the long position of the risk-free bond has a nominal value equivalent to a forward contract and is the estimated energy cost that the organization is willing to pay. The innovation is the valuation of the structured product modeling the underlying returns with an α-stable stochastic process. The performance of the returns is analyzed with descriptive statistics and the α-stable parameters estimation, statistically justifying the relevance of the α-stable process with goodness of fit tests. Concluding that hedging for price risk minimizes energy costs, α-stable options are statistically more efficient and less expensive than Gaussian options and that gas is less expensive than oil in the period studied.;financial engineering | Stochastic processes | structured products;0;0;;;;undefined;

This study analyzes the instability of the current economic system from the perspective of the Austrian School, considering its tendency to recurrence, its unequal growth rates, high inflation, financial volatility, strong monetary issues, variability in production and public deficits, among other problems. The methodology is qualitative in that it analyzes documents and quantitative in that it analyzes and interprets data from selected variables. The hypothesis is that the economic system requires institutional arrangements in order to favor profit maximization practices, thereby creating greater risks. Macroeconomic variables are analyzed, and the results show patterns of the economic cycle in a context of economic liberalization, deregulation and other forms of adaptation of economic policies with a view to facilitating the expansion of transnational capital. The economic and financial events are marked by instability, this being accentuated from the eighties of the last century. The paper concludes by pointing out the need to incorporate inclusive economic and social policies, since the current ones contradict the theoretical postulates and the possibility of achieving the goals of development so long promised.;Austrian school | Economic cycle | Economic policies | Economic-financial instability | Macroeconomic variables;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

In the first, commercial banking positively impacts economic activity, while in the second, the stock market influences the performance of the economy. A third view considers that all financial activity (banks, stock market and other financial institutions) influences growth. These hypotheses are assessed by using a VEC model. The empirical findings suggest that, considering the liquidity of the financial system, stock market activity predominates throughout the study period; but when we take the size of the financial system, banking activity prevails. We also show that increasing financial system liquidity had a positive effect on economic growth, although increasing the size of the financial system decreased the GDP per capita over the period 1980-2014. Moreover, the short-term dynamic analysis reveals that if the financial structure became more marketed-oriented, the effect on economic growth would be positive.";banking sector | economic growth | financial structure | stock market;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The first one argues that Schumpeter’s theory of business cycles stems from a historical understanding of economic crises and, consequently, it can be conceived as an instance of the historical style of economic reasoning. The second point argues that the decline of this historical style of economic reasoning can be linked to the growing success of Keynesianism, to the detriment of Schumpeter’s work. The decline of the historical style clearly revealed an irreconcilable conflict among different economic rationalities during the second half of the twentieth century, and brought into question the epistemological legitimacy of economic history with respect to synchronic analysis.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Undoubtedly, the alliance between Roegenians and Odumites was decisive in the emergence of ecological economics and in its subsequent institutionalization. In this chapter I will review some of the most significant polemics with neoclassical economists in which the Roegenians, i.e., Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly, were involved.

In this last chapter, I show that this reinstatement is rather a rehabilitation of the philosophical and epistemological uses of the history of science, something already present in the continental historiography of science in the first half of the twentieth century and especially in Gaston Bachelard’s work. In this respect, I undertake a review of the European history and philosophy of science during that period, paying special attention to Gaston Bachelard as one of the leading representatives of the French historical epistemology of the 1930s. The late and quite problematic reception of Bachelard’s thought in the early work of Thomas S. Kuhn provides an opportunity to review the main philosophical tenets of classical historical epistemology.

The issue of a historical epistemology of mathematical ecology finds a suitable place in this context, that is to say, in what I call “the two chief epistemic styles of mathematical ecology”, the “Galilean style” and the “fictional style”. The first one – the “Galilean style” – finds exemplification in astronomy studies and considers nature as an expression of rationality. The Galilean style works on the assumption that the laws of nature can be discovered and expressed in the language of mathematics. Differently, the “fictional style” takes mathematical representations as “fictions” aimed to adjust the empirical basis to a scientific theory. Its distinctive feature lies in assuming an ontological distance between the natural object and its mathematical representation. My main claim is that the historical oscillation between both chief epistemic styles proves the epistemological historicity of mathematical ecology.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

However, his criticism has not yet received an adequate response and the opportunity has been thereby missed to improve this kind of methodology in history of science. In this chapter, I will argue that the shortcomings pointed out by Kusch result from assuming a realistic conception of the styles of reasoning, as if they were actually existing structures that vertebrate the history of science, and not so much heuristic and discursive tools aimed to the production of historical narratives. Following Arnold I. Davidson’s insight, my basic claim is that the styles of reasoning should be taken as a special kind of metaphor, a “historiographical metaphor”, whose purpose is to express the different ways of doing science and writing its history in a context of epistemological pluralism.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

In order to address this problem, I rely here on the so-called historical epistemology of economics. I will then investigate seven styles of economic reasoning, some of them conflicting, and thereby point to the occurrence of communication breakdowns in economics. My main claim is that the stabilization of a biophysical style of economic reasoning, in the period that goes from Lotka’s Elements of Physical Biology (1925) to the publication of the famous report of the Club of Rome, The Limits to Growth (1972), was decisive for the emergence of ecological economics as a scientific discipline in the last third of the twentieth century. However, this biophysical style of reasoning is not necessarily shared by other economic disciplines. Recognizing multiple styles of economic reasoning and the features that distinguish them can finally serve to better understand the difficulties in convincing economists who do not belong to the same style of reasoning, and then try to overcome potential communication breakdowns.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

To this aim I will make reference to the famous debate between Popper and Kuhn on the occasion of a symposium held in London in 1965. Popper saw in Kuhn’s early investigations on paradigms and incommensurability an example of what he labeled the “myth of the framework”, that is to say, “the belief that it is impossible for the investigators to shortly come out of the framework of concepts and principles within which they are working, and compare it with other competing frameworks”. In my opinion, the issue of the “myth of the framework” can help us clarify some basic assumptions underpinning the historical epistemology of the styles of scientific reasoning as well as its relevance for a theory of communication. In this regard, I will argue that the epistemological explanation of communication breakdowns implies a framework-based relativistic understanding of the styles of reasoning, while the taxonomies of styles presuppose a non-framework-based transcendental understanding of the styles of reasoning. On these grounds, I will suggest a revision of Dow’s theory of modes of thought in economics as well as of the ensuing polemics concerning methodological pluralism in ecological economics. All of this is meant to prepare the ground for the next chapter, in which I will articulate the proposal of a historical epistemology of styles of economic reasoning in relation to the history of ecological economics.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

In so doing, I will undertake a case study on the epistemological constructive and destructive functions that some metaphors played in the development of ecological economics as a scientific discipline. In particular, I will investigate the “environmental metaphors of scarcity”, under which I include the metaphors of “economic metabolism”, “carrying capacity”, “ecological footprint”, and “natural capital”. Some of these metaphors were expressly aimed against the conceptual hegemony of neoclassical economics, and all of them were linked to biophysical indicators addressed at measuring sustainability and environmental impact. Thus, these metaphors can be also taken as “metric metaphors”. In this regard, I will outline a metaphorological paradigm of metrization, namely, metaphors that are terminologized through a measurement methodology. I will then argue that these metric metaphors – especially that of “natural capital” – despite their initial destructive epistemological function, provided the ground for a revival of neoclassical economics within ecological economics itself. The metric metaphors of ecological economics carried the neoclassical Trojan horses, as response to the problem of environmental accounting for the so-called natural assets and ecosystem services.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

This is what happens with the coypu (Myocastor coypus) in gated communities in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires (Argentina), where its rapid population growth results in continuous conflicts with the local inhabitants. The aim of this study was to document the daily and seasonal activity patterns and behavior of the coypu in an urban landscape within their natural distribution range. To achieve this, we conducted a camera-trap survey within areas occupied by the species from February to November 2018. The coypu activity was mainly crepuscular and nocturnal with variations between seasons. We found that the seasons with the greatest activity patterns overlap were winter and autumn (84%), while the least overlap was observed between summer and winter (53%). During the active periods, time spent on foraging behavior was dominant. Time dedicated to vigilance was greater in summer than in winter. This result, alongside an increase in nocturnal activity during summer, shows that coypu in this urban landscape shift its behavior when exposed to an increasing human activity. This study brings up more ecological data of this species, which is key to find alternative control methods within gated communities to lead to a harmonic relationship between inhabitants and the species in its native distribution.;activity patterns | behaviour | gated community | Myocastor coypus;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Methodology: The regional innovation system was analyzed by identifying the innovation networks. Subsequently, a typology of enterprises was generated according to the networks in which they participate and an analysis of variance and comparison tests of Scheffé means between clusters. Findings: In the regional innovation system, the networks were made up of government institutions, teaching and research institutions, and suppliers of inputs and services, where the latter have the highest degrees of articulation. Also, positive effects were identified in the efficiency indicators of the enterprises related to the networks made up of government institutions, teaching and research institutions, and the extension services. Practical implications: The identification of these interactions is essential for the design of public policies for the promotion of innovation. For example, for the design of a smart extension program that articulates all the actors and that all benefit from their interactions. Theoretical implications: The study reveals the positive influence of the regional innovation system on enterprises. In addition, it rekindles the discussion on the relevance of the State in the operation of innovation systems, the role of universities in the generation of knowledge and the extension service in the diffusion of new knowledge, information and practices. Originality/value: The study generates important knowledge about the regional innovation system and about the design of an innovation management strategy.;Agricultural education | greenhouses | policy | smart agriculture | smart extension | smart regional specialization;1;0;;;;undefined;

To this end, a number of models have appeared in the literature from which the self-similar least-action walk model (SLAW) stands out as an approach mainly intended to incorporate several statistical properties of human motion. Although it is generally accepted that this model is able to produce realistic traces, so far not enough attention has been given towards creating an implementation with an upfront clear design that is also reliable and computationally efficient. This paper addresses these issues by presenting the design, implementation, and validation of a SLAW simulator. This simulator follows the discrete-event simulation paradigm for generation of mobility traces and is flexible enough for incorporating future walker models. This simulator can be used, among other purposes, to perform computer-based studies of networking technologies where human mobility plays a major role.;Human mobility | self-similar least-action walk model | simulation | SLAW;2;0;;;;undefined;

Knowledge is considered today as one of the most important factors in organizations since that allows them to react to changes in the environment, as the establishment of flows within them allows them to be more competitive and innovative. But what happens when that knowledge is in an educational institution, in which, despite being considered its most important asset, the appropriate knowledge networks are not established so that they can respond to these changes, preventing the development of internal and external transfer processes. This original article is derived from the doctoral thesis titled Organizational Learning as a Mechanism of Knowledge Transfer in Higher Education Institutions. Objective. To show how university research groups behave as learning organizations to identify the factors that allowed developing that learning. Method. For this, a qualitative study of a descriptive-evaluative, non-experimental, single-measure type was designed, in which a triangulation of instruments was used to corroborate and validate the findings through the use of tools such as interviews, surveys, participant observation, and analysis of social networks. Results. The results obtained were analyzed with specialized tools for qualitative data as MaxQDA and Ucinet used in mixed research methods. Conclusions. The study allowed identifying how education institutions and, in particular, research groups could become learning organizations and make social networks with different types of flows between them.;Higher education institutions | Knowledge | Knowledge transfer | Organizational learning;1;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Using the Spanish Survey of Household Finances for 2011–2014, this paper asks whether and to what extent debt burdens enhance these detrimental health effects. To address potential endogeneity problems surrounding this question, the paper adopts Deb and Trivedi’s (Econometrics Journal, 9, 307–331, 2006) econometric approach. The results show that the negative effect of job insecurity on self-assessed health is exacerbated if the individual is over-indebted. Moreover, the role of over-indebtedness differs between types of debt, with non-mortgage debts causing larger health losses than mortgage debts. Thus, concerns about job insecurity should not be decoupled from concerns about increasing household indebtedness, and policy measures intended to improve individual welfare should consider both phenomena together.;debt burdens | job insecurity | self-assessed health;1;0;repositoryam;Green;;PID2019‐111765GB‐I00;

Large litter sizes are known to promote alterations in memory processes and anxiety-like behavior. Nevertheless, the effect of large litter size on sexual behavior and the reproductive system is still unknown. Environmental enrichment has been reported to (EE) enhance behavior and to correct some of the alterations produced by postnatal undernutrition. We used the Elevated Plus Maze (EPN), Morris Water Maze (MWM), Object Recognition test (OR) and several parameters of sexual behavior to determine the effect of large litter size on rats exposed to enriched and non-enriched environments. Newborn Wistar rats of both sexes were assigned to be suckled under lactation conditions, in litters of 8 pups or 16 pups. The large litter size (16 pups) caused a reduction in weight gain during the lactation period. On PND 45, four experimental groups were established for both sexes: Well-nourished Non-enriched (WN); Well-nourished Enriched (WE); undernourished Non-enriched (UN); Undernourished Enriched (UE). On PND 90, the UN males spent more time in the open arms on EPM. On PND 100, the UE females increased the latency to find the platform in training days (D1-4) in MWM. On probe day (D5) the UE males spent more time in the target quadrants in MWM. On PND 110, irrespective of EE the large litter size had increased the exploration time in both groups (UN) and (UE) in OR test. On PND 120, the performance of sexual behavior was more evident by effect of EE irrespective of the litter size. In conclusion, the large litter size showed no effects on sexual behavior, in contrast, EE has a sharp influence on sexual behavior.

Understanding the decision of business registration as a rational choice of the entrepreneurs, where she weighs the costs versus the benefits of such formalization, the study expands the literature on informal entrepreneurship by looking at the benefit-side rather than the typically evaluated cost-side of an individual cost-benefit evaluation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors relied on the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) adult population survey to evaluate the hypothesis. Specifically, the authors used the GEM data of 2016 for Colombia, covering 2,069 observations (a representative sample at the country level), evaluating the relationship between innovativeness and business registration for the early stage of the entrepreneurial process. Given the nature of our dependent variable, the authors estimated a logistic regression model. Findings: Different from what the authors hypothesized, they did not find empirical evidence for a positive correlation between an innovative product or service and business registration. Instead, businesses that compete with many others offering the same product/service have a higher tendency to register at the Chamber of Commerce. Contrarily of what might be suspected, opportunity-based entrepreneurship – as opposed to necessity-based – is not a relevant variable when formalizing a business, providing evidence for our hypothesis that necessity-based entrepreneurship cannot be equalized with informal entrepreneurship. Additionally, the authors show that an entrepreneur with higher socioeconomic status is more likely to register his company. Research limitations/implications: The results provide first exploratory evidence that the benefit evaluation may play a role in formalizing a start-up, thus calling for future research that not only tackles the influence of registration costs and administrative burden but rather looks at the outcome of a cost-benefit analysis. The data imply several limitations which future research should address: variables measuring the innovativeness of the product/service are rather coarse measures and need to be expanded and detailed in future research. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that a relatively high number of missing values may generate a selection bias in our population sample. Finally, because of situating the research in a developing country, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications: In a country like Colombia with very high levels of informality, it is necessary that the government fully understands the role of innovation in the formalization process of start-ups. The results indicate that a differentiation of support mechanisms to increase the formalization of businesses according to the different stages of their development may be necessary and that aside from costs, benefits of formalization play a role. A higher level of formality is not only related to economic growth but also much better protection of workers, therefore going beyond the reduction of registration costs and the implied administrative burden should be an additional public policy target for decreasing informality. Finally, the correlation of socioeconomic stratum with the decision to register hints at a varying evaluation of formalization, a point that merits attention by government and academia. Originality/value: The study shifts the focus from the evaluation of solely costs for business registering as a barrier to start-up formalization to the cost-benefit analysis. The authors propose – and show – that such an evaluation is not generalizable for all kinds of business. Specifically, the authors show that a start-up is more likely to register when it competes with a large number of competitors than when it competes with a smaller number of others offering the same. At the same time, the authors also show that the stage at which the start-up company is at influences the decision to formalize.;Business registration | Developing country | Informal entrepreneurship | Innovation | Necessity-based entrepreneurship | Opportunity-based entrepreneurship;3;0;;;;121577657885;Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS)

Community-based ecotourism (CBE) is part of a set of sustainable options that are available to households for diversification. This paper analyses households’ capital assets that increase the probability of a family becoming involved in a CBE compared to other forms of diversification, and empirical evidence is presented for coastal communities located in Oaxaca, Mexico. Based on household surveys and a multinomial logit econometric model, the results show that the probability that a household decides to become involved in CBE increases for households with young people and those that have their basic needs covered by government programs or small agricultural production. Other forms of diversification are positively related to agreements within the community, woodfire use, and the presence of irrigated lands. Thus, CBE is determined by specific assets mentioned previously compared to other forms of diversification. Particularly, to promote CBE, tourism policies need to consider households’ human, social, natural, and financial capital assets and the associated programs in an integrated way to enhance community development.;Assets | Coastal communities | Resilience | Rural households;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;290832;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Since the technical details of the production of such a photography are not readily available, I will reconstruct the experimental setting. Paying attention to the technical details opens up a venue for historical and philosophical reflection based on the creative potential of scientific practices. Through a critical approach, a rather generic experimental meshwork could be turned into a natural-artifactual, living-nonliving hybrid setting in which the concepts of dense technological environment, philosophical toy, and experimental system meet and intertwine thanks to the playfulness that goes through them, a quality rooted in scientific practices.

Children with LBW are more vulnerable to having disabilities. There are many studies on LBW, but only a small proportion has examined local geographical patterns in LBW and its determinants. LBW is a particular health concern in Mexico. The study aims to: (i) model the change in the LBW risk at the municipality level in Greater Mexico City, identifying municipalities with highest and lowest LBW risk; and (ii) explore the role of some socioeconomic and demographic risk factors in explaining LBW variations. We propose a Bayesian spatio-temporal analysis to control for space-time patterning of the data and for maternal age and prenatal care, both found to be important LBW determinants. Most of the high-risk municipalities are in the south-west and west of Greater Mexico City; and although for many of these municipalities the trend is stable, some present an increasing LBW risk over time. The results also identify those with medium-risk and with an increasing trend. These findings can support decision-makers in geographical targeting efforts to address spatial health inequalities, they may also facilitate a more proactive and cost-efficient approach to reduce LBW risk.";Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling | Child health | Space-time variation | Spatial random effects | Term low birth weight;0;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In 2010, Mexico City started its BSS, named Ecobici, with 84 stations and reached more than 840,000 trips that year. Ecobici rapidly became a preferred option for many users. By 2019, the number of stations in Ecobici had grown almost 6 times since the first year. In addition, the number of registered trips on 2019 was more than 8.4 million and the number of trips in a weekday were more than 30,000. In order to incentivize the adoption of bike as transportation mode, Ecobici and other BSS need to handle the bike inventory at their stations throughout the day. There are many challenges for optimizing bike inventory in BSS given the complex interdependencies, the non-homogeneous demand flows, and the large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we propose and study a simulation–optimization framework to minimize the number of shortage events (failed bike withdrawals and returns) by setting an adequate bike inventory at each station throughout the day. We propose an efficient modeling approach to simulate large-scale BSS and a simulation–optimization heuristic to optimize bike inventory. The experiments show that these algorithms obtain results with similar quality than other search methods, but in a significant shorter amount of time.;Bike-sharing system | Inventory | Simulation-optimization;4;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The paper develops two new notions of economic complexity based on the study of interactions between different development factors. (1) Transformational complexity denotes a country's pace of structural transformations over time, arguing that an economy is more complex if a large number of factors are able to drive the system out-of-equilibrium and towards new growth paths. (2) Systemic complexity represents a country's overall density of causal relationships that link together its development factors, based on the idea that an economy is more complex if its growth path is simultaneously driven by several co-evolving factors. We build up a system dynamics model that develops these ideas, and then test its predictions using time series analysis. Making use of the Johansen cointegration approach, and using annual time series data for the period 1970-2015, we apply the new notions of complexity to the study of economic development for 134 countries. The results show that transformational complexity is positively correlated with GDP per capita growth during the period, and that systemic complexity is positively correlated with the level of GDP per capita at the end of the time span. Our results suggest that there may be different paths to achieve greater complexity and economic growth, depending on the core set of capabilities that each national system has, and that it is able to develop over time.;Coevolution | Cointegration analysis | Complexity | Growth and development | System dynamics model;1;0;;;CONACYT;CB2020-39595;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Here we present a geospatial analysis of EBF prevalence estimates from 2000 to 2018 across 94 LMICs mapped to policy-relevant administrative units (for example, districts), quantify subnational inequalities and their changes over time, and estimate probabilities of meeting the World Health Organization’s Global Nutrition Target (WHO GNT) of ≥70% EBF prevalence by 2030. While six LMICs are projected to meet the WHO GNT of ≥70% EBF prevalence at a national scale, only three are predicted to meet the target in all their district-level units by 2030.;;10;1;repositoryam;Green;BMGF;PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0084;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

In this article we firstly show how there are some hints of this paradox in texts prior to 1891. Secondly we review some arguments given in the literature to hold that with 'the concept horse' Frege referred to the extension of the mentioned concept. Finally, we argue that, even if the concept horse is such an extension, we still know very little about its nature, given the fragmentary way in which Frege introduces the extensions of concepts in Grundgesetze and in previous essays.;extension | Frege | innefability | paradox | representation;0;0;;;;undefined;

Yet under certain conditions it is possible to keep the water in a non-equilibrium liquid-like phase called supercooled water thus avoiding solidification. In such a state water may freeze under the tiniest perturbation (as stirring it a little). The existence of supercooled water is usually known to students since the introductory courses, but it seems difficult for them to attest such a water state in an undergraduate laboratory. A simple method for supercooling water is, however, readily available. It is this short paper aim to describe such a method in a form that may be performed in any elementary laboratory.;Metastable states | Supercooled water | Undergraduate laboratories;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), machine learning and data science are used to analyze the impact of WABT on the educational process. The results of machine learning (60%, 70% and 80% of training) indicate that WABT positively influences the Motivation, Autonomy, Personalized learning and Active role. Data science identifies predictive models of the impact of WABT on the teaching and learning process through the decision tree technique. In addition, WABT is a pleasant, simple, useful and innovative web tool for the educational field.

We study the relationship between the productive structure of municipalities of the three Mexican regions with their poverty rates in 2015. We estimate models of poverty determinants on employment branches, controlling for economic, demographic, and territorial factors. Heterogeneous relationships between the productive structure and poverty were identified for each region and sector. For the southern region, branches such as transport, communications services, education, health, government, and tourism are related to lower poverty rates. For the central and northern region, lower rates are found for machinery and equipment production, insurance, business support, professional services, leisure, and government activities. These results suggest that policies based on the promotion of productive structures must consider regional differences to effectively reduce poverty.;Employment branches | Mexico | Poverty | Regional development;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Methodology: The explanatory case study consists of five cases of political violence against women in Mexico and five in Ecuador. Critical analysis of discourse in a political context is applied to address how certain roles and gender stereotypes sustain this violence and articulate it to a hierarchical order that subordinates women. Conclusions: The analysis corroborates that political violence against women is often framed in specific disputes of the political-electoral systems in which it occurs, which can contribute to losing sight of its gender specificity. Despite this and the diverse nature of its manifestations, which determines its visibility, the articulating nucleus is a dichotomous order of gender throughout which women are still represented as subjects incapable of performing effectively in the political sphere. Originality: The reconstruction of cases of political violence against women in two countries contributes to a concept of recent discussion, whose relevance continues to be the subject of debate. The article reviews those debates and situates them in the political practice of Latin American women, from where the need to recognize specific and current violence that threatens their rights originated precisely.;Ecuador | Gender | Mexico | Political participation | Political violence | Women's participation;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Tannins (TANs) can be used to minimize the environmental impact of ruminant production because they can improve ruminal fermentation and ruminants’ lifetime performances and mitigate methane (CH4) emissions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with TANs as sustainable natural alternative to reduce the environmental impact on growth performance, rumen fermentation, enteric CH4 emissions, and nitrogen (N) use efficiency of beef cattle through a meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of studies published in scientific journals that investigated the effects of TANs’ supplementation on the variables of interest was performed using the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. The data analyzed were extracted from 32 peer-reviewed publications. The effects of TANs were assessed using random-effects statistical models to examine the standardized mean difference (SMD) between TANs’ treatments and control (non-TANs). The heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression and subgroup analysis was performed for the covariates that were significant. TANs’ supplementation did not affect weight gain, feed consumption, feed efficiency, or N use efficiency (p > 0.05). However, it reduced the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in rumen (SMD = −0.508, p < 0.001), CH4 emissions per day (SMD = −0.474, p < 0.01) and per unit dry matter intake (SMD = −0.408, p < 0.01), urinary N excretion (SMD = −0.338, p < 0.05), and dry matter digestibility (SMD = −0.589, p < 0.001). Ruminal propionate (SMD = 0.250) and butyrate (SMD = 0.198) concentrations and fecal N excretion (SMD = 0.860) improved in response to TANs’ supplementation (p < 0.05). In conclusion, it is possible to use TANs as a CH4 mitigation strategy without affecting cattle growth rate. In addition, the shift from urinary to fecal N may be beneficial for environment preservation, as urinary N induces more harmful emissions than fecal N. Therefore, the addition of tannins in the diet of beef cattle could be used as a sustainable natural alternative to reduce the environmental impact of beef production.;Bioactive compounds | Climate change | Feed efficiency | Meta-regression | Sustainability;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;UACh;undefined;Universidad Autónoma Chapingo

Thermal technologies such as multi‐effect distillation and multi‐stage flash distillation still comprise an important portion of the world’s desalination capacity. They consume substantial amounts of energy, generally obtained from fossil fuels, due to their low efficiency. Hybridization is a strategy that seeks to reduce the weaknesses and enhance the advantages of each element that makes it up. This paper introduces a review of the most recent publications on hybridizations between reverse osmosis and thermal desalination technologies, as well as their integration with renewable energies as a requirement to decarbonize desalination processes. Different configurations provide improvements in key elements of the system to reduce energy consumption, brine production, and contamination, while improving product quality and production rate.

In high-income countries, sexual minorities are at a higher risk for disordered eating behaviors. It is not known whether these findings can be extrapolated to Mexico. Objective. Determine whether there are any differences in disordered eating behaviors among Mexican youth according to sexual orientation and analyze the potential role of experiences of violence and discrimination as mediators of these differences. Method. Data from a representative sample of Mexican youth (12 to 29 years old, n = 27,876) were analyzed. Three groups were identified: young people who were not in love (NIL), who were in love with people of the opposite sex (ILOS), or in love with people of the same sex (ILSS). Restrictive behaviors, secret eating, and self-induced vomiting were identified through a scale created for the survey. Results. ILSS men had a higher risk of restrictive thoughts and behaviors (B = .31), secret eating (OR = 2.21), and self-induced vomiting (OR = 3.65) than ILOS youth. Among women, there was only a difference in self-induced vomiting (RM = 2.49). In both sexes, being a young ILSS had an indirect effect on restrictive behaviors through its association with experiences of violence, discrimination at school, and sexual violence. Discussion and conclusion. Mexican sexual minority men are at a higher risk of disordered eating behaviors, whereas sexual minority women are at a higher risk of purging. Part of the differences in restrictive behaviors were explained by the increased risk for experiences of prejudice faced by sexual minority youth.;discriminación | discrimination | eating and food ingestion disorders | gender | género | inequidades | inequities | Orientación sexual | Sexual orientation | trastornos de la alimentación y de la ingestión de alimentos | violence | violencia;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

This effect has been found when treatments that disrupt neuronal activity are administered to different regions of the brain, including the amygdala. However, the molecular mechanisms induced by this intense training are unknown. We made a detailed mapping of c-Fos-expressing neurons in four regions of the amygdala after moderate and intense one-trial inhibitory avoidance training. Rats were sacrificed 90 min after training or after appropriate control procedures, and their brains were prepared for immunohistochemical c-Fos protein detection in the central, lateral, and in the anterior and posterior parts of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus. We found a high percentage of neurons expressing c-Fos in the anterior part of the basolateral nucleus after moderate training, and this percentage increased further after intense training. Moderate and intense training did not induce changes in c-Fos expression in the other explored amygdaloid regions. These results show that inhibitory avoidance training produces a localized expression of c-Fos in the basolateral anterior nucleus of the amygdala, which is dependent upon the intensity of training, and indicate that synaptic plastic changes in this region may be required for the formation of memory of moderate and intense aversive learning.;Basolateral amygdala | c-Fos | Extinction | Inhibitory avoidance | Intense training;0;0;;;CONACYT;203918;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Using the methodology proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz, spill rates to and from the United States and Latin American Integrated Market were estimated and analyzed. The results confirm the existence of spillovers from the S&P500, without being greater than those occurring during the years prior to 2020, with the exception of the Mexican market, which received a greater influence. The results can be useful in guiding financing and investment decisions in the stock markets of the region in the Latin American Integrated Market.;"Connectedness | COVID-19 | MILA | S&amp;P500 | Spillovers";0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Therefore, it is frequently disturbed by the action of several moderate and strong earthquakes, affecting both the population and its infrastructure. The origin, causes, and effects of the typical observed damage patterns during the September 7, 2017 Tehuantepec earthquake (Mw = 8.2), in masonry houses and apartment buildings, located in cities and towns of the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca in a radius of about 250 km from the epicenter are reported and discussed in this paper. The high structural vulnerability and the severity of the earthquake resulted in the death of 96 people and more than 110,000 houses damaged, where more than 41,000 were considered total losses (collapse, beyond repair or tagged for demolition). In order to analytically evaluate the seismic vulnerability of typical masonry structures ranging from one to five stories, displacement ductility demand spectra (DDDS) were computed for both earthquake ground motions records and artificial acceleration records for a wide range of base shear capacities. Special attention is given to relate the observed damage with conditions of structural irregularity. Effects of flexible diaphragms, structural pounding between adjacent structures and site effects are also addressed. From the information presented, it can be concluded that most of the observed typical damage it is mostly due to poor design, inadequate construction processes, poor quality of construction materials and low wall density ratios. Finally, it was clearly observed that DDDS is a useful tool for the simplified seismic vulnerability assessment of a large portfolio of existing structures under a given earthquake scenario.;Displacement ductility demands | Housing | Masonry | Seismic typical damage | Seismic vulnerability assessment | Structural irregularity | Structural pounding | Tehuantepec earthquake;11;0;;;IIUNAM;undefined;Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

This team followed a different path to identify the rules that govern scientific work by asking researchers if, in their opinion, there are rules in scientific research, and, if so, what they are. An opinion poll was conducted among 270 scientists who received academic training at universities in Mexico, Europe, and the United States, and who work at three universities in Mexico. The instrument is based on a social psychology theory that divides memories into spontaneous and assisted, and a dichotomous probability distribution was used to identify variations. Between eight and nine out of ten researchers from physical, biological, and social sciences recognized that there are four rules for research: to study reality as it is, have a critical attitude, have a methodological aptitude, and express willingness to openly publish results. Despite the heterogeneity of the disciplines researchers practice and the variety of their academic training, there is a consensus among scientists about the validity of such rules to conduct scientific research, although most of the time they do not mention them spontaneously.";Epistemology of science | Methodology | Science | Scientific investigation | Sociology of science;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

It is shown that the southwest's high level of labor informality will not only prevent a minimum-wage increase from addressing that region's high level of poverty effectively, but will actually worsen Mexico's unequal territorial distribution of income. Therefore, we maintain that, under the current conditions of the country's labor market, saying that the existing policy of increasing the minimum wage will reduce both poverty and inequality amounts to a contradictio in adiecto. Such a policy will continue to be self-contradictory until it considers implementing, as well, a job guarantee policy.;Job guarantee | Minimum wage | Territorial inequality;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

The first organizations that were involved with CSR (in the second half of the decade of 1990) rose as a central objective to integrate the concept of CSR in the sphere of business. During the last ten years the development of CSR in Mexico has taken a greater momentum. It is throughout this period that the Mexican Government has begun to have a most important role in CSR development. About this new role, it must be signaled that the Mexican State has signed two international agreements concerning CSR: the first one of them is the Declaration of Santiago (2013) where Mexico, through the Bilateral Cooperation between the EU and the CELAC, basically promised to realize efforts about the legislation concerning the CSR, as well as in the elaboration of a National Action Plan aligned with the recommendations about CSR that are already contemplated in the majority of the European Union States. The NAPs Draft, according to the Work Group guided by the Ministry of the Interior, was going to be be finished in December 2016, but there has been an important delay. The second major agreement signed by the Mexican State is the implementation of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises for which there is an operational instance at the national level: the National Contact Point created in 2011. In this context, the present paper aims to analyze the new role of the Mexican Government in the development of CSR and the future implications.;Corporate Social Responsibility | Energy Reform | Mexico | Social Impact Assessment;0;0;;;;undefined;

It has the second largest economy in Latin America and is a major oil exporter. However, economic crises, political instability, natural disasters, and a deep socio-economic gap have meant that prosperity remains a dream for many Mexicans. The informal sector still predominates the workforce, and almost half of the country’s population lives in poverty. CSR policies are more and more evolving, but for the majority of companies in Mexico, social responsibility finds itself still in an initial state, and is rather considered a philanthropic issue with no relation to the policies of the companies. In this context, CSR-related preferences of young job seekers, especially concerning employee responsibility, are relatively pronounced and reflect a concern for a good, secure and fair work environment.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Over time, production of corn for self consumption has tended to decline and has lost relevance within income sources of poor people increasing food insecurity. This was corroborated by regression-based inequality decomposition by income sources and we found that contribution of self-consumption on non-monetary income decreased, from 10.1% in 1992 to 1.7% in 2018.;Extreme poverty | Food insecurity | Income inequality;0;0;;;;undefined;

Because Mexico City is located in an area of clay soil with excess water content, the earthquakes that occur too often in the country, have been causing structural damage to the buildings, so their structural repair and architectural improvement has been necessary. In this sense, the reconstruction tasks undertaken from 2018 to recover the buildings damaged by the earthquake of September 19, 2017, involves a double risk to workers because the structures are damaged and unstable at risk of falling and too by the risks themselves of the construction sector, which is the sector with the most presence of accidents.;accidents | earthquakes | labor | reconstruction | Risks;0;0;;;;undefined;

This article contributes to reimagining the current tasks of anthropology reviewing how anthropologists and sociologists from various countries dealt with intercultural misunderstandings, such as Marc Abélès, Roberto da Matta, Gustavo Lins Ribeiro, Claudio Lomnitz, Guillermo O’Donnell, Renato Ortiz, Rossana Reguillo, Ana Rosas Mantecón and recent studies on youth, technologies and academic exchanges.

Consequently, peri-urban phenomena have not been clearly explained and the policies addressed at these spaces are not explicit or differentiated. This article aims to provi-de panoramic information on the peri-urban in Mexico. First, a method is proposed for the identification of the peri-urban based on the Shannon entropy index that measures the heterogeneity of land use. Second, we characterize the peri-urban space by demographic, social and territorial attributes. Finally, the study identifies four sociodemographic and territorial dimensions of the peri-urban space: 1) socio-occupational polarization, 2) the opposition between natural land and cultivated land, 3) urbanization as a built environment, and demographic dynamics, and 4) social marginalization and informal dwelling. These dimensions suggest differentiated simultaneous processes in the peri-urban space.;National urban system | Peri-urban space | Urban sprawl | Urbanization;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

A questionnaire was applied to record information related to the adherence to ART of the participants and their experiences of violence and discrimination associated with homophobia and internalized homophobia. Between 14% and 33% of MSM reported experiences of discrimination and between 41% and 60% experienced violence. When participants had jointly experienced both types of stressors, the risk of low adherence to ART in the previous month was higher (RP=6.49) than when they had experienced only one of them (RP=4.36 for violence and RP=5.67 for discrimination).

The proposal focusses on two-course models of transdisciplinary entrepreneurship education (TEE), which involve andragogy and heutagogy as the basis of entrepreneurial competency development. Design/methodology/approach: The competencies acquired during the proposed course models for TEE are analysed through Bayesian methods. The study is conducted using 400 opinions of students from Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico City. Findings: The proposed TEE models are auspicious for establishing an educational pattern to develop entrepreneurship competencies in undergraduate students with the independence of their school of origin. Originality/value: Nowadays, universities recognise the importance of providing entrepreneurship education as part of their mission. However, well-defined canons to guide such teaching are still non-existent. This paper fills a gap on what and how to teach TEE. By providing a new competency classification based on soft and technical skills, the authors contribute to the pattern of what to teach in entrepreneurship. The authors provide guidance on the teaching methods for TEE through two-course models based on andragogy and heutagogy.

Households in the three poorest deciles have a water access rate of 87.4% and an affordability rate of 4.74%. With the given water policy, households that are not covered, or have deficient coverage, rely on strategies for substituting piped water, which require an investment of time and additional monetary expenses.;Accessibility | affordability | drinking water | inequity | poverty;1;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The more market-oriented policy gained renewed momentum in the Western world-even in Eastern Europe-once socialism entered crisis and the essence of laissez faire presented itself as the ideological winning alternative. The purpose of this work is to identify economic reforms as a legacy of the mexican political regime, which are in the international context of trade liberalization. The hypothesis that arises is that these reforms undertaken in Mexico have not achieved higher rates of economic growth and well-being of the majority of the population, since they were not the result of consensus, nor were they designed in response to the public interest, as they also did not adhere to the principles of truthfulness. The methodology used is qualitative and quantitative. The results show that, in general, the reforms augured well-being and modernity, however, no positive indicators are observed in the referred variables. It is concluded, therefore, that it is essential that the decisions of greater importance for society should incorporate information and analysis mechanisms for the participation of all economic agents.;Civil society | Economic development | Economic reforms | Political regime | Social welfare;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Under this conception and the commitment that life is valuable in itself, the book presents the story of life from its origin and our history as humankind.

Therefore, an ontology design should be driven by the constant and efficient validation of end-users needs. However, there is not an existing standard process in knowledge engineering that guides the ontology design with the required quality. There are several ontology design processes, which range from iterative to sequential, but they fail to ensure the practical application of an ontology and to quantitatively validate end-user requirements through the evolution of an ontology. In this paper, an ontology design process is proposed, which is driven by end-user requirements, defined as Competency Questions (CQs). The process is called CQ-Driven Ontology DEsign Process (CODEP) and it includes activities that validate and verify the incremental design of an ontology through metrics based on defined CQs. CODEP has also been applied in the design and development of an ontology in the context of a Mexican Hospital for supporting Neurologist specialists. The specialists were involved, during the application of CODEP, in collecting quality measurements and validating the ontology increments. This application can demonstrate the feasibility of CODEP to deliver ontologies with similar requirements in other contexts.;"competency questions | ontology evolution | Ontology iterative design process | quality indicators | verification &amp; validation metrics";1;1;repositoryvor;Green;H2020;713654;Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

As the diagnosis confirmation is performed by a postmortem neuropathological examination of the brain, this disease can be confused with other types of dementia at early stages. About 860,000 Mexicans are affected by dementia, most of them with insufficient access to adequate comprehensive health care services. Plasma biomarkers could be a rapid option for early diagnosis of the disease. Objective: This study aimed to analyze some plasma biomarkers (amyloid-β, tau, and lipids) in Mexican AD patients and control subjects with no associated neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: Plasma amyloid-β peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42), total and phosphorylated tau protein (T-tau and P-tau), and cholesterol and triglyceride levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in AD patients and control subjects. Results: In Mexican AD patients, we found significantly lower levels of Aβ42 (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. In contrast, significantly higher levels of P-tau (p < 0.05) and triglycerides (p < 0.05) were observed in AD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the severity of dementia and plasma P-tau levels, Aβ42/Aβ40 and P-tau/T-tau ratios, and triglycerides concentrations. This correlation increased gradually with cognitive decline. Conclusion: The detection of these plasma biomarkers is an initial step in searching for a timely, less invasive, and cost-efficient diagnosis in Mexicans.;Alzheimer's disease | amyloid-β | early diagnosis | Mexican patients | tau protein;1;0;;;CONACYT;99096803;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The model, based upon the Marxist-feminist approach, suggests that the magnitude of unpaid housework is determined by the super-exploitation of labor, i.e. the gap between wages and the value of labor-power. The outcome is an equation that relates positively the magnitude of unpaid housework with the super-exploitation of labor. The parametric and nonparametric regression estimates applied in both countries show preliminary empirical support for the theoretical model. The theoretical and empirical findings have several implications for Marxist-feminist literature as well as for empirical research on unpaid housework.;Colombia | Mexico | super-exploitation of labor | Unpaid housework;1;0;;;;undefined;

At the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana more than a third of the students considers that learning online has been minimum or null and 76.1% of their professors use their own equipment to teach online and 74.6% work more hours than the established in their contracts. At the Instituto Politécnico Nacional, 20% of its students did not take classes online and 10% of their professors did not teach online.

Mexico is no exception and, on the contrary, in terms of tax revenues it has shown little progress despite the various reforms that have been implemented in the recent past. The health crisis makes a tax reform necessary in the country, not immediately, but if it is necessary and should emphasize the construction of one, with a medium and long term view to cover the demand for public spending and reversing the history of low revenue the country has faced for at least the last 50 years. This document explores basic theoretical aspects and experiences of Latin America aimed at vitalizing the discussions in the construction of said reform. Additionally, the relationship between tax revenues and GDP is estimated with a structural rupture model to get an idea of what the fall in public revenues may be in the coming months.;Latin America | Mexico | Tax reform | Tax revenue;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

To achieve this goal, the risk behavior of the system was analyzed through its conditional volatility estimated by GARCH family models. The relevance of the changes stated in the reform project regarding the amount and length of the contributions made by the workers, in the light of the impact that the crisis will have on their salaries, was evaluated. This was done by simulating with the Monte Carlo method the total savings balance accumulated at the end of the active life of a standard worker, assuming different income levels. It was concluded that persistence of volatility and asymmetry effects were present, and that workers would be better off if the reform includes measures that increase the amount of the contributions but do not decrease the contribution period.;Conditional volatility | Economic crisis by COVID-19 pandemic | Pension systems | SIEFORE;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The diabetes epidemic ranked second in causes of death in Mexico, a situation that was severely complicated during the second quarter of 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies carried out by the Ministry of Public Health showed that the comorbidity of diabetes with COVID-19 has become a risk factor for serious complications, increasing the mortality rate. For this reason, it is necessary to develop personalized information management systems to support medical decision-making considering the specific characteristics of patients in Mexico. Information management of the diabetic patient profile begins with the investigation and registration of the relevant clinical data, data used by the physician to make the diagnosis and determine a personalized treatment. This article reports the development and integration of an ontology model for the management of diabetic patient profiles, incorporating medical ontologies. The results of the evaluation show the feasibility of using this integrated ontology for the management of diabetic patient presenting comorbidities.

This urban renaissance has also come together with a neo-liberal outsourcing of its productive systems. As a dynamic phenomenon, tourism has not come alone, but accompa-nied, on a large number of occasions, by profound physical and symbolic transformations: urban projects, cultural policies, celebrations and hosting of mega-events, etc. In this way, the metamor-phosis of the urban space, as well as the aestheticization of its structure, are the consequence of the dynamic role of tourism and culture, current bases of economic change. In all this, markets, both traditional retail markets, as well as a new typology that has emerged in recent years specialized in aesthetics and leisure, are fundamental in the continuation of the processes of capitalist accumulation. This article aims to show, through an analysis of two different markets-Mercado de Motores and Palo Alto Market, located in the cities of Madrid and Barcelona-the role that these facilities play in the dynamics of tertiarization and consumption of the contemporary cities. In order to do that, we will show their common elements and those that make them unique, with the aim of highlighting their new functionality in the international competition for making cities more attractive for visitors and capitals.;Cities | Leisure | Markets | Tourism;1;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

This study focused on the relation between drivers of change and household trajectory. The study was carried out in Santa Catarina Tayata, in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. 44 household heads were interviewed to recall their production system and economic activities at significant moments. The results were summarized as variables describing the socio-economic and agronomic situation of households over three decades: 1988-1997, 1998-2007, and 2008-2017. Household types were identified for each decade. Three household types were distinguishable in the first two decades, and five in the last decade. Drivers of change such as international markets, land tenure, government support, and migration were connected to household trajectories. Results showed that household type diversity increased, while half of the households changed types at one point according to different strategies. Changes in land tenure in the study area in the early 2000s were attributable to the PROCEDE national program, which acted to lift restrictions on land tenure, facilitating the buying and selling of land. The implementation of PROCEDE resulted in fewer households relying on borrowed or rented land while allowing others to expand their land and form a new household type. A migration process enabled some households to invest in land or animal production as a “step up” strategy. The majority of households that received agriculture-related subsidies tended to engage solely in agricultural activities. Half of the households that did not benefit from subsidies engaged in off-farm to diversify their income, suggesting that the type of governmental support can have an impact on farming activities. Household types that had more animal production or larger areas did not tend to engage in off-farm activities because of high demands for labor in their production systems. This type of study can be used to monitor policy impact and households’ strategic responses, to arrive at better articulation of policy objectives and policy impact while considering household type diversity.;Drivers of change | Household trajectory | Household typology | Livelihood | Meso-America | Mexico;7;0;repositoryvor;Green;CGIAR;A4032.09.20;Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers

In this context, we synthesized ZnS thin films using the sol-gel method aiming at evaluating the effect of some zinc and sulfur precursors, complexing agents, and thermal treatment on ZnS obtention. The resulting solids were treated in an oxidizing atmosphere and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to establish the most suitable reaction protocol for ZnS preparation. Based on these results we were able to deposit ZnS coatings on glass-quartz substrates using the spin-coating technique. The films were also subjected to heat treatment based on gaseous nitrogen and elemental sulfur. ZnS coatings were characterized through XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-Ray dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and UV-Vis spectroscopy.

This is also true for the state of Sonora, which is characterized by the predominance of arid ecosystems in its territory. Since then, the extraction of precious metals such as gold through open mining has also increased. This paper uses a political ecology perspective in order to analyze socio-environmental conflicts over water caused by mega mining activities in Sonora, in particular loss of water quality due to toxic spills and water scarcity. Data were systematized and analyzed using various journalistic and academic sources. Eleven water-related conflicts were identified. Eight are related to a decrease in water quality due to toxic spills while three are related to water access decrease due to water hoarding by mining enterprises. The analysis underlines the weaknesses of the environmental governance model prevailing in Mexico which places private interests before public ones. It is argued that the State needs to recover its power to protect human rights, including the human right to water.;Human rights to water | Mega mining | Socio-environmental conflicts | Water access | Water pollution;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

We confirmed the two hypotheses outlined: (i) TCA process does not follow a linear path in Mexican biotech firms and (ii) firms with lower capital investment levels exhibit a lower level of TCA and less complex internationalization strategies; while firms with higher capital investment levels are associated with higher TCA levels and more complex internationalization strategies. Biotechnology requires high levels of capital investment and these to a large extent determine the development and technological capabilities accumulation.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on field site visits and focus group interviews. Findings: Traditional knowledge was being reinvented in two contrasting ways. One was based on heritage tourism drawing on syncretism between Aztec and Spanish culture in the formation of Xochimilco. The other was agro-ecological focussed on traditional farming practices on the chinampas, their productivity, their ability to sustain biodiversity and their link to social justice. There were some common elements, such as a passionate concern with retaining a valued past in the face of growing threat. Research limitations/implications: Traditional knowledge is often seen as a static heritage, under threat.

Indigenous and peasant communities throughout the Americas are self-consciously restructuring their organisations and governance structures, taking control of territories they claimed for generations. They are also reorganising production to generate surplus, assembling their members to take advantage of underutilised resources and peoples’ energies for improving their ability to raise living standards and assure environmental conservation and restoration. These communities are not operating in isolation. They coordinate activities, share information and build alliances. Hundreds of millions of people are participating in this growing movement; they occupy much more than one-quarter of the world’s land area. There is great potential for others to join them, expanding from the substantial areas where they are already operational.

The kinetic assays showed that it was optimal at a sulfide concentration of 3.2 mg/L under an external photosynthetically active radiation of 50 and 120 μE/m2 s together with a pH of 8.5 and 9.2. In contrast, the oxygenic photosynthetic activity was insignificant at 15 μE/m2 s with a pH of 7.3, both in the absence and presence of sulfide. Consecutive pulse additions of dissolved sulfide evidenced that the accumulation rate of dissolved oxygen was decreased by the spontaneous chemical oxidation of sulfide with dissolved oxygen in alkaline culture media, mainly at high sulfide levels. At 3.2 mg/L of sulfide, the oxygenic photosynthetic activity was improved by around 60% compared to the treatment without sulfide at external irradiances of 120 μE/m2 s, 30 °C, and pH of 8.5 and 9.2. Additionally, an even higher OPA enhancement (around 85%) was observed in the same previous conditions but using 16 mg/L of sulfide.

Six pigmented corn and barley beers were brewed and then analysed to obtain their sensory characteristics, volatile composition and non-volatile (alcohol, bitterness, anthocyanins and polyphenol content) composition. ANOVAs, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) were used to visualise these data for exploring the differences between beers based on the type of malt and to characterise corn beers considering the relationships between their sensory characteristics and their chemical parameters. The sensory attributes such as fermented fruits, cooked vegetables, tortillas, bread, dried fruits and dried chili characterised beers made 100% with pigmented corn. Over 100 volatiles were identified by head space-solid phase micro-extraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). Among them, phenols and terpenes were the groups of volatiles that better characterised beers containing corn. The content of anthocyanins in corn beers provide the 'amber-red-cooper' colours in beers and may prevent the development of off-aromas and tastes. The use of pigmented corn seems to be a good option to renew the traditional 'Sendechó' while preserving some of its sensory attributes.Â;Anthocyanins | Gc-ms | Hs-spme | SendechÃ | Sensory profile | Volatiles | Zea mays;14;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Although there is growing interest in the subject, it is worth asking whether the research has been approached considering citizens' needs or citizens' participation. The main objective of this study is to analyse whether energy efficiency research has adopted a citizen science perspective. Using scientometric methods, the SCOPUS and CORDIS databases were consulted and a document search strategy was developed to gather information on publications and projects. The analysis revealed that, out of 265 projects under the Seventh Framework Programme on Energy Efficiency, only seven (3%) were related to citizen science. Although there is a large volume of publications on energy efficiency (over 200,000) and a considerable number of publications on citizen science (>30,000 articles), only 336 documents were identified that deal with both topics. The number of projects and publications on these topics has increased in recent years, with universities being the institutions that have published the most. Content analysis found that the most frequent topics are public perception of the use of renewable energies; citizen participation in measures to address climate change and global warming; and the involvement of different stakeholders in the use and responsible consumption of energy. Finally, information was collected on the impact of these publications on social media and altmetric tools. It was revealed that 33% of the 336 papers have had a presence in different sources, especially Twitter.

Once we identified and described the most common difficulties found by these studies, the problem will be analyzed using the Approach Based in Human Rights. In this way, it is possible to know the responsibilities of agents involved in the schooling of these minors. States, local authorities, educational centers and teachers are mainly responsible for guaranteeing the right to education of these children. The most common barriers are: the acquisition of the language of the host country, culture, school harassment, xenophobia and lack of teacher training.

We found that there is a close relationship between adaptative strategies of this local community and the NP Izta-Popo Management Program. Strategies such as the sustainable use of ecological resources (ecotourism) based on training, educational, and traditional tools generate economic benefits for families and ecosystem services for environmental conservation. However, the lack of coordination among local and federal institutions represents a gap that the community seeks to reduce through active participation in governance processes that directly affect environmental degradation. Thus, the adaptive capacity of this community, in a context of change and risk, plays an important role in decreasing the ecological deterioration of NP Izta-Popo through participatory, inclusive, and bidirectional approaches.;Community adaptive capacity | Mexico | National park izta-popo | Peri-urban natural protected areas | Resilience;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;CVU #539063;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This theoretical study was done at three different temperatures: 302, 371, and 450 K. The molecular dynamics has been performed in explicit aqueous solvent during a period of time of 95 ns, including periodic boundary conditions and constant pressure. The same procedure has been used for both proteins, and each simulation has been carried out by triplicate. Hence, we performed 18 simulations. In this way, we have done different analyses to explore the factors that may affect the thermal stability of Pk-MGMT. The structural behavior was analyzed using indicators such as root-mean-square deviation, radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, hydrogen bonds, native contacts, secondary structure, and salt bridge formation. The results showed that when the temperature increases, the global atomic fluctuations increase too, which suggests that both proteins lose thermal stability, but as expected, this fact is highlighted in AdaC. Moreover, the contacts of the native state in AdaC are considerably lower than those found in Pk-MGMT at 450 K. Also, the structural studies showed that conserved and nonconserved salt bridges kept close contacts with the Pk-MGMT protein at high temperatures. These interaction types act as molecular staples and are mainly responsible to provide thermostability to the hyperthermophilic protein.;;3;0;;;;undefined;

The AEL presents the mathematical procedure on the use of the logarithm to find the time (number of years) during the application for a bank loan. The TPACK model allows the organization of the AEL through technological knowledge (PHP programming language), pedagogical knowledge (simulation strategy) and disciplinary knowledge (use of the logarithm in the field of financial mathematics). The results of machine learning with 50%, 60% and 70% training indicate that the AEL positively influences the assimilation of knowledge about the logarithm, development of mathematical skills and understanding of the theoretical concepts of the logarithm in the field of financial mathematics.

However, at the same time, this resource can present shortage problems, mainly due to a lack of knowledge about its value. In most emerging countries, the monetary value of water used in the production process does not necessarily reflect that there is a shortage, or the costs of catchment and treatment. Thus, the real cost of water is not paid. In addition, it is vital that the various manufacturing industries consider the opportunity cost, or shadow price, of consuming water for its production processes. Therefore, this paper estimates the economic value of water (EVW) for the manufacturing industry in a water basin with shortage problems (Valley of Mexico Basin (VMB), Mexico). This is understood as the shadow price, using the concept of production elasticity with respect to water input (εW) and the value of the marginal product (ρW). To that end, we used information from 69,984 economic units surveyed in 2013, and considered one type of production function, i.e., translog. The εW was estimated at 0.061 and the ρW at US $ 19.4/m3. The ρW ranged from US $ 2.3/m3 for the wood sector to US $ 20.1/m3 for the beverage and tobacco sector, demonstrating variation in ρW by sector. The results have important implications for several areas of industrial water management, especially for water basins where this resource presents shortage problems. Any investment in new industrial water supply projects requires information on the industrial EVW. That information is also needed in order to determine how to efficiently distribute scarce water resources across sectors.;Economic value | Manufacturing industry | Scarcity | Water;11;0;;;CONACYT;120-2015;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Results show that credit card holding does not have statistical effects on education expenditure, nor on durable goods consumption.

However, there is limited evidence for the relationship between urban form and economic productivity outside high-income countries. While we know that workers in larger cities are more productive, existing empirical evidence on the relationship between compactness and productivity is only from high-income countries, with a productive service sector. Given that the economic base of many cities in Mexico consists of land-intensive manufacturing activities, policies promoting urban compactness have potential negative impacts on economic growth by restraining expansion. In this paper we explore the relationship in time between urban form/spatial structure and economic productivity in Mexico, by testing the hypothesis that growing in a compact way is positively associated with labor productivity. That hypothesis is not completely rejected because several measures of urban form are positively correlated with higher levels of productivity, and other measures are negatively correlated. As the principal findings are counterintuitive, they raise questions about what is the accepted knowledge of urban growth.;Manufacturing | México | Productivity | Urban Form | Urban structure;1;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;FONARSEC;278953-S0025-2016-1;Fondo Argentino Sectorial

We explore how Ribot and Peluso’s Theory of Access can be applied to address critical theoretical gaps in SES by examining how its structural and relational access mechanisms relate to diversity, feedbacks and connectivity which are central to the dynamics of SES. Testing this through two different case studies, on land use issues in Mexico and marine fisheries in the United Kingdom, we illustrate how an analysis focused on access deepens our understanding of resilience.

A couple of cvar models are estimated with the aim of testing whether the government expenditure is endogenous to economic growth, in which case the fiscal deficit will not necessarily be the sole source of inflation. According to our empirical results, it is shown that there is a long-run negative relationship between government spending and inflation, without involving a Granger causality. Both models jointly reveal that the higher the economic growth rate, the larger government expenditure and the lower the rate of inflation.;Central Bank | Debt | Inflation;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

This chapter aims to analyze the university’s role in the process of building social responsibility in line with efforts to adequately fulfill its three missions of teaching, research, and linking with society. The case study herein refers to the Universidad Panamericana (UP), a private university in Mexico with humanistic and Christian roots, which recently celebrated its 50th year. The analysis demonstrates the UP’s significant efforts to build a social responsibility system and its achievement of significant social impact through programs that support the community, healthcare, and people with disabilities.

This article is an interpretative exercise from the sociology of emotions and collective action perspectives on the social movement of San Salvador Atenco, Mexico, whose goal was the defense of their territory threatened for the airport megaproject during the period 2001-2002. I will argue how the intra and intercommunal social relations, the affective bonds woven throughout time, the relationship between inhabitants and their territory, all played a relevant role collective actor building. With support on qualitative research techniques, such as semi-structured interviews and participant observation, I will explore the affective dimension in the constitutive dynamics of this collective actor. As we will see, both grievance and the feeling of injustice were emotions present at early stages of this movement, while pride and topophilia contributed to maintaining the mobilization, furthermore, these elements were part of the collective identity of the people for Atenco.;Collective identity | Emotions | Social movements | Territory;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The song is “a composition in verse accompanied by music”, with the verse being the smallest unit of poetic language. Etymologically, according to the dictionary of Maria Moliner, the word “protest” comes from the Latin term protestari, composed from the verb testari, which means to witness, to testify, or to declare, along with the term testis, which means to witness. In time, civil rights themes expanded in popular protest music, most notably including themes on the treatment of Native Americans. Meanwhile, just as musicians crafted protest music in support of the civil rights movement, others confronted the terrible reality of the Cold War in song. The creators, performers, and scholars of music who gathered at the Varadero Festival defined themselves as “protest song workers.”.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

The concept of cultural industries and the reflection on the matter have their origin in the Frankfurt School. The essay that gave rise to the concept was “The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception” published in the book Dialectics of Enlightenment by Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer. In the case of the North American discussion, the critical current of the media’s political economy followed these debates, contributed their own perspectives including those of Herbert Schiller, Dallas Smythe and Thomas Guback.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the growth and upgrading trajectory of Huawei Mexico is at a crossroads due to pressure from the Trump administration. The Huawei’s expectations of greater growth in Mexico seem to have been left behind, which has resulted in its new strategy. For instance, it has positioned its branch of devices in Mexico with a new subsidiary.

A qualitative approach is used, and the text is based on five individual and two collective interviews conducted in 2011 on farms and in public spaces in the peripheral area of the Montreal Region, Quebec. Fragments of the interviews allow us to observe the space as a site of conflict and as a capital that gives workers the capacity for agency which allows them to confront relations of domination and subordination in the “field of migrant agricultural seasonal work in Canada”, and to confront socio-spatial isolation and exclusion. Other forms of capital are also observed, such as lin-guistic and social, which allow spatial capital to be to generate and increased.;Agency | Citizenship | Field | Labour migration | Unfree labour;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

After a first use of 11 days, the CIDR was again used for either nine or 12 days with 200 or 300 IU equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) being injected on its removal. Sixty-four ewes were randomly distributed to four treatments (n=16/group): CIDR9+eCG200, CIDR9+eCG300, CIDR12+eCG200, and CIDR12+eCG300. The eCG was administered intramuscularly on withdrawal of the device. Thus, the experiment was a completely randomized design with a 2×2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Oestrus presentation did not differ between treatments (P =0.29). However, with the dose of 200 IU of eCG, oestrus presentation tended to increase (P =0.08). The onset and duration of oestrus, percentage of gestation, and return to oestrus did not differ between treatments (P >0.05). Progesterone concentration in serum was greater (P < 0.05) in ewes treated with CIDR12+eCG300.

The diversity of approaches typical of the institutional theory is remarked, ad-dressing two of its most relevant theoretical currents: the new sociological institutionalism and the institutional logics, whose extensive development has fostered a rapprochement between organizational studies and organization theory. This paper studies the advantages of such proximity but also some of its limitations; mainly that organizational studies have been partly absorbed by the study of institutions, neglecting the development of some lines of reflection grounded on Human Sciences. The balance of organizational studies increasingly oscillates between being considered an advanced management course or a specialized sociology class. The first case represents a greater risk for this type of studies in Latin America, given that, among other reasons, they have mainly originated in Administration schools and departments, which has hindered its development as a private project. The main contribution of this work focuses on the idea that a more effective development of organizational studies could be achieved by strengthening its disciplinary identity in order to build better links with management, sociology and organization theory. We also propose some action lines that represent important challenges for improving the necessary conditions to achieve a better development of organizational studies.";Institutional logics | Institutional theory | New institution-alism | Organization theory | Organizational studies;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

I start with the conception according to which the philosopher should at best exhibit the nonsense of other philosophers, but should finally be forced to shut up, given that his own discourse necessarily exceeds the limits of rationality. Next, I propose an intrerpretative methodology for philosophy in an attempt to characterize these limits more precisely and avoid the silence which would make all philosophical discourse impossible. Finally, I try to reconcile this philosophical interpretative methodology with the internal irrationality of the philosopher by appealing to a division in his mind between common sense and a second agency which is bound to exceed it. This philosophical schizophrenia would be the only way to understand its recurring task of safely drawing the limits of our ordinary understanding of the world.;Division of mind | Folk psychology | Interpretation | Irrationality | Nonsense | Philosophical methodology | Reasons and causes;0;0;;;;undefined;

Given its recognised importance, many countries have included it in their national curriculum. To date, little is known as to whether teachers are promoting this competence in classrooms. This qualitative exploratory research investigated whether preschool teachers in participating countries favoured L2L through their teaching practices. It identified similarities and differences between participating countries. Participants included 23 preschool teachers: 5 in Italy, 4 in Mexico, 10 in Spain and 4 in Uruguay. We used semi-structured interviews and performed content analysis to identify the L2L elements fostered by teachers. We matched these elements with the theoretical dimensions of our conceptual framework. We found that participating teachers report a variety of activities to foster this competency. Most activities promoted elements of more than one dimension of L2L. We observed cross-country differences both in the predominance of activities and in the pedagogical objectives pursued with them. Participants in countries with a curriculum promoting L2L (Italy and Spain) reported implementing more practices and favoured more L2L elements than countries where guidelines to promote such competence do not exist or are not clear (Mexico and Uruguay).;Early childhood education | Key competence | Learning to learn | Pedagogical practices;0;1;;;;undefined;

To obtain the volatility, we used the GARCH model to estimate the volatilities of the first three main principal components of each yield curve. The GARCHs obtained of the first three orthogonal components are modelling the volatility of the parallel shift, the slope changes (twist) and the changes in curvature (butterfly). To obtain the volatility index, it is required to use the variances obtained using the orthogonality of the series added and then obtain the square root of the sum. This approach also allows the estimation of defined semi-positive variance-covariance matrices for the different nodes of the curve that can be used in portfolio optimization or in the computation of risk measures.

Export performance is measured in terms of import market shares in the US and numerous econometric issues are addressed to produce reliable evidence. In addition to capturing some heterogeneity among different manufacturing subsectors, this study shows that: (i) a depreciation of the real exchange rate calculated for each subsector worsens (rather than improves) Mexico's export performance, which is likely due to the high import content of Mexican manufacturing exports; (ii) a fall in domestic unit labor costs has a positive impact on Mexico's export performance, which highlights the importance of raising labor productivity faster than wages; and (iii) a reduction in US unit labor costs deteriorates Mexico's export performance.

Secondly, the idea of how the senses follow a social order in designation according to gender and occupation is recalled. Thirdly, the tasks carried out are displayed in this profession, where there is an involvement of the body in accordance with technology, the meeting of which can be considered as a sensory experience, in the terms of Merleau-Ponty, while there is a discipline of the bodies to carry out the assignments, recalling Mauss and Foucault. Finally, there is a focus on the contribution that the secretary provides through different body techniques such as shorthand, typing, dictation, and text editing, all of them generating a specific form of writing, which contains a construction, appropriation and meaning in the relationship of female work with regards to technology.;Body studies | Secretary | Sensory experience | Sensory studies | Sexual division of labour;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

For this case, a phenomenological approach (Couldry et al. 2016) has been selected which integrates Internet technology-as well as other artefacts, actors and materiality-as a space from where and through which meaning is generated within the lived perceptual experience (Ihde, 2004) of Mexican women who have had a pregnancy during their teenage years. The study was carried out following a qualitative approach, between February and May 2019. 10 women were interviewed, all residents of the State of Mexico, who were pregnant between the ages of 14 and 19.

The results show that the institution reconfigured its history and implemented guidelines established by public policies that underlie a perspective of higher education management based on international proposals where New Public Management (NPM) and governance generate different dynamics that modify the rules of the game by overvaluing the research function and giving new meaning to the work of academics in a logic of scientific production to achieve objectives that improve the reputation and positioning of the institution in national and international rankings.;Academics | Accreditation | Colombia | Higher Education;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Using microdata from the National Income and Expenditure Survey (NIES), this research seeks to identify the factors that affect over-indebtedness in households, and to offer an explanation of said phenomenon using a neural network methodology. The principal determinant of over-indebtedness in Mexican households is the existence of bank credit, given that this indicates a long-term transfer of family income to the financial sector.;Acquiring power | Artificial neural networks | Commercial banking | Consumer credit | Financial debt;1;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

In my view, both theorists and politicians should be aware how a concept that lacks any precision does not help us to understand our present moment of crisis.

In the engineering electrical field, most of the practice laboratories are equipped with a large set of devices. One of the major challenges to get a complete laboratory is the economic cost. Professional electronic devices as multi-meters, oscilloscopes or spectrum analyzers are quite expensive on the market. Fortunately, with the aid of software-defined radio (SDR), low-cost equipment can be built. A fundamental device in these projects is the RTL-SDR dongle. This electronic accessory captures wireless signals and puts them on a USB port. Therefore, with digital signal processing it is possible to get access to low-cost instruments like spectrum analyzers. In this work, an integration of hardware and software is presented. An application is developed with Python and implemented on a Raspberry Pi3 B+. This proposal captures, demodulates, and displays AM and FM signals.

The aim is to provide new housing indicators that are capable of bringing the concept of sustainability into the cities of MICs. The results reveal that the percentage of influence that single-family housing (SFH) can achieve in the metric established by each system is relatively low. However, considering all of the identified indicators, this influence could increase to 53.16% of the total score in multi-criteria evaluations. Furthermore, a significant lack of indicators for mandatory criteria evaluations was found, with CASA being the only system that considers their inclusion. This paper identifies 37 indicators for multi-criteria assessments and two for mandatory-criteria assessments, providing new perspectives on several topics.

This paper argues that it is necessary to frame the TCA processes at national levels, including the techno-economic and the socio-political spheres (TES and SPS). It is argued that countries' evolutionary trajectory combines these spheres differently and results in different development profiles. This is expected to have an impact on their TCA. The objective is to identify and analyse development profiles of Latin American countries (in terms of TES and SPS), and discuss it relationship with the characteristics of TCA at the firm level. This research departures from descriptive statistics based on Innovation Surveys for the TCA analysis at the firm and country level, and combines different steps and tools to asses country development profiles: (i) a long-term analysis (1980–2010) to verify the existence of cointegration between TES and SPS; and (ii) the identification and estimation of long run paths that determine three different country profiles.

This chapter places breastfeeding into sociohistorical perspective demonstrating how it came about to be influenced by religious, cultural and political factors: passing from being a sacred act clouded in mystery that guaranteed survival for a newborn to a subject of scientific experimentation and, fairly recently, to an expression of particular type of parenting practices, that some feminist scholars have categorized as 'intensive mothering'. The chapter also explores attitudes towards breastfeeding in public, an act seen as problematic in the West due to the sexualisation of a female breast, aesthetic canons, the dichotomy of private / public space and the predominance of specific representations of gender, femininity and motherhood that sometimes tend to marginalize or stigmatize breastfeeding. Lastly, the focus moves to researching breastfeeding patterns in Mexico where, in spite of recent public policies to promote exclusive and extended breastfeeding, the majority of mothers do not follow official recommendations, making the country the fourth biggest consumer of infant formula globally. The chapter outlines the importance of studying the motives behind individual decisions of mothers connecting them to broader normative discourses that shape parenting practices in a given society.";Bodily practice | Breastfeeding | Gender | Mexico | Motherhood;0;0;;;;undefined;

We would expect knowledge production, particularly when is publicly funded, to be oriented towards the generation of useful applications and to collaborate in the solution of this disease. In this paper, we aim at analysing knowledge production for diabetes in terms of the Pasteur's quadrant, which consist of two axes: (i) ‘consideration of knowledge use’ and (ii) ‘search for fundamental knowledge’. We organized 303 diabetes projects supported by CONACYT funds to operationalize a structural equation modelling (SEM) that frames diabetes research in Mexico. We found that most of research funds are not devoted to projects with high levels of ‘consideration of knowledge use’; we believe that this is caused by the context of scientific funding in Mexico, which have incentives for basic research and does not count with sufficient mechanisms to orient the use of new scientific knowledge. We outline some policy recommendations. First, incentives should be focused on reorienting the research system towards a greater consideration of knowledge use. Second, the project approval process could also be modified to be more democratic, which the scientific community could discuss and find consensus with other social actors.";Diabetes research | innovation policy | knowledge production | Mexican research system | Pasteur's quadrant;3;0;;;CONACYT;CB2015-258387;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Participants were 781 women and 570 male students of a public university, with an average age of 20.1 years (SD = 2.7) and 21.2 years (SD = 3.3), respectively. The participants completed a set of self-report questionnaires, and their weight and height were measured. The prevalence of moderate frequency REB among women was 23.0% and high frequency 10.1%, while among men it was 22.3% and 6.7%, respectively (p = 0.07). Among women, the characteristics that increased the risk to present REB were: body dissatisfaction (OR = 5.4), negative affect (OR = 3.8), internalization of the ideal of thinness (OR = 3.6), and practicing some sport (OR = 2.8). Among men, these characteristics were: having being teased (OR = 10.3), drive for muscularity (OR = 3.4), body mass index (OR = 3.5) and practicing some sport (OR = 3.1). Given the different characteristics that increase the probability of presenting REB among university students and men, it is necessary to establish models that describe the specific risk conditions according to sex, as well as, to develop appropriate instruments and interventions.;Body image | Ideal of thinness | Muscularity | Risky eating behaviors | University students;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;CONACYT;403696;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Participant observation and semi-structured interviews were carried out in 17 cheese agribusinesses located in the area of San José de Gracia, Michoacán (Mexico), in order to get insight into the family, inter-company, commercial and technical ties they have built. The SNA showed that in the community there is a meso-system where different cheese companies that produce either natural, imitation or both cheeses converge and coexist. These agroindustries make up a complex social structure composed of 1717 actors, comprising a dispersed network with low connectivity (density < 0.5%) due to the commercial nature of the relationships (95.9%). Simultaneously, an underlying network with a higher density (1.73%) was also evident, enriched by kinship and friendship ties that create cooperation and trust among the parties through 136 reciprocal tangible and intangible exchanges. Despite the differences and asymmetries of cheese agribusinesses in this community, the social structure they form behaves like a 'local neighborhood' where everyone knows everyone, and everyone coexists, competes and shares with one another, allowing them to be sustainable in the marketplace. This study provides important lessons for institutions that promote competitiveness and local development, because it shows that in order to achieve sustainability of agroindustrial companies, it is important to recognize and promote long-term social structures based on trust, friendship and reciprocity.;Cheese | Coexistence | Kindship | Reciprocity | Social network;1;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It argues that the nls were not a purely academic project in their beginnings, but a political criticism closely related to the current poscolonial or decolonial thought that questions the policies and discourses that neglect or downplay cultural practices by non-dominant groups in society and, at the same time, reclaims their knowledge, voices, identities and practices. It also argues that literate education in Latin American countries must be a project of educating agents with voice, equipped with the capacity and willingness to think and speak for themselves publicly. To reconstruct this history and ground this argument, the article reviews three major movements behind decolonial thinking: the intellectual movement of the nls; the historical movements of resistance and liberation against colonialism and neocolonialism in Latin America; and the intellectual movement self-named poscoloniality or decoloniality, articulated in recent decades by scholars in Europe, North America and Latin America.";Decolonialism | Educational research | Literacy | New literacy studies | Postcolonialism;8;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

For students, it is very important to grasp the basic concepts that make computers and digital systems possible. Among these concepts, boolean algebra and logic gates stand out. In this paper, a smartphone-based augmented reality (AR) system is proposed which helps in the adequate learning of logic gate integrated circuits (ICs). The proposed system allows the automatic identification of ICs that enables basic logic operations. It uses a smartphone and a breadboard for the identification of 7 basic logic gate ICs that are: AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate, NAND gate, NOR gate, XOR gate, and XNOR gate. The smartphone takes a picture of the electronic circuit and digitally generates a layer of virtual objects which are then mixed with the original image. The markless paradigm identifies the ICs in a typical circuit and places three objects that are: IC identification, pins information, and logic diagram information. Finally, the smartphone screen displays the image of the logic gate obtained. The entire evaluation of the AR system is presented with a technical efficiency of 97.5 and a qualitative satisfaction study.;android | app. development | augmented reality | electrical engineering | logic gates;14;0;;;;undefined;

This invitation is unknown to most historians due to the scarce documentary evidence. To carry out our inquiry, we consulted the set of available clues: diplomatic correspondence; primary sources; documents from the period; types of diplomatic operations; the identity of the Colombian agent likely to have sent the invitation and the profile of the person supposedly proposed to represent the French government. Originality: Most of the studies available ignore this episode in the relations between France and Latin America during the first years of Independence. Even some of the most influential historians deny its possibility. To our knowledge, this article is the first in systematically analyze the invitation to France while considering a variety of documents and records from Europe and America. Methodology: The research was guided by a historiographical approach, which was based on an exhaustive search of the sources. Conclusions: The article argues that the invitation did indeed take place as an offer, and that the rejection of the French prime minister was motivated by his alliance with the Government of Spain. Likewise, the way the invitation was handled drove the French Government to seek neutrality in the War of Independence. This attitude was indirectly shown by the fact that Franch approached Great Britain to mediate the conflict.";Connected histories | Contemporary history | Integration | International relations;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The constitutive models and the finite element method were validated by comparing the computed numerical results with the experimental results of a rectangular slab reported in the scientific literature. The coefficient method is proposed for its simplicity to calculate design bending moments in slabs with circular, elliptic, and triangular geometries. These coefficients were computed from the FE analysis. The layout of steel reinforcement is proposed, particularly lengths of zones for positive and negative moments, respectively. The crack paths are showed, which are depending on the boundary conditions, acting loads, and geometry of the slabs.;Coefficient method | Cracking | Damage model | Finite elements | Moment design | Slabs;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Taking the reader on a car journey of urban disorganisation and traffic jams in Mexico City, the analysis shows how informality has become part of an everyday social contract. It is argued that the diverse world of informal practices, working as a popular survival strategy, is also entrenched in the workings of formal institutions, which draw on under-the-counter agreements and exchanges with the illegal economy, be that in the construction of public works in the city, in film and clothes piracy or in the public provision of water, transport, light or Internet services. The global hegemonic system could not function without these agreements: the transition from informality to illegality is slippery. If Mexico City is a global city it is not just for participating in the networks of transnational corporations, consulting firms and international tourism; it is also because of its networks with super brands in legal and illegal production. The article concludes by suggesting that an informal system of production, transactions and distribution of goods and services linking entrepreneurs from all continents can position the city on a global scale through non-hegemonic globalisation.";entrepreneurs | globalisation and illegality | informal sector | Mexico City;14;0;;;;undefined;

We recognize two types of models: those where changes at the national scale explain regional differences, or international models with an economic emphasis, which assume that world markets and trade are the main aspects producing change and evolution in countries and regions.

This chapter approaches the topic of aesthetic treatment by recognising an inherent complexity with the tendency to judge beauty practices as an expression of superficiality, vanity or social oppression. I first provide an original perspective about aesthetic surgery practices based on the theory of anthropopoiesis, the theoretical mark proposed by the cultural anthropologist Francesco Remotti. As inferred by this author, people’s concern with beauty can be read symbolically as an effort to grant subjects the ability to reach into ontological categories of ‘human-beingness’. In this regard, surgical procedures may help individuals resolve their feeling of incompleteness and escape their condition of social marginality. Then, in two field cases that emphasize psycho-socio-aesthetics and a humanitarian cosmetic surgery, I focus on the viewpoint adopted by beauty practitioners who consider aesthetic enhancements a cathartic process alleviating patients’ uneasiness and suffering. In this study, I argue that an aesthetic treatment should be recognised as a practice of well-being, because it enhances patients’ psychological and social well-being. Moreover, I reinforce the fact that ethical considerations guide the practice of beauty-care.;Aesthetic treatments | anthropo-poiesis | beauty | beauty-care | ethics | humanitarian cosmetic surgery | psycho-socioaesthetics | self-improvement;0;0;;;;undefined;

It deals with the perspectives of Benjamin Shepard, Hannah Arendt, and Jacques Ranciere on the relationship of aesthetics and politics in contemporary societies. The chapter focuses on three dimensions in which the relationship between hip-hop and politics is expressed: as a way to do and practice an aesthetic creation; as a space for reflection and repertory of collective memory; and as a place of enunciation, subjectivation, and political participation. The historic development of the recording and broadcasting technologies in the last hundred years has produced a radical change in the making and enjoying of music in contemporary societies, giving way to the emergence of new forms of work, aesthetic expressions, and political practices.";;0;0;;;;undefined;

However, Albert Einstein used non-Euclidean geometries in a way that seems to contradict Poincaré. With a brief reconstruction of Poincaré's arguments and considering the history of Einstein's inquiry about relativity, I show that the use of non-Euclidean geometries is motivated by considerations about measurement that are not considered by Poincaré's conventionalism. I make use of the recent literature in philosophy of science about measurement practices to reevaluate this case. The study allows conclusions to be drawn about the need to adequately identify the decision mechanisms that operate in scientific practice.;Einstein | Poincaré | relativity | space | time;0;0;;;;undefined;

Without contradicting the perspective, although implying a completely different intellectual commitment, the concept of “post”-modernity indicates that there is a process that emerges “from within” modernity and reveals a state of crisis within globalization. China is one example that demonstrates the degree to which European world hegemony was impossible before the Industrial Revolution. Max Weber had the intuition that if Europe not been the region most prepared to carry out the Industrial Revolution, it would have been China or Hindustan. European hegemony, principally British and French, was a result of the Industrial Revolution, in turn ideologically based on the “Enlightenment” and “Romanticism.”.;;2;0;;;;undefined;

Due to the use of different statistical measurements, a narrative was chosen to present the results. An association between negative comments and DEBs was found in male and female university students. Women reported more negative comments, higher body dissatisfaction and DEBs than men. Body dissatisfaction was found as a mediator of negative comments and DEBs, and sex as a moderator between body dissatisfaction and DEBs. The results have implications for the influence social pressure has on the internalization of the thin-ideal and on body dissatisfaction as risk factors for the development of disordered eating behaviours.";Body image | Disordered eating | Eating disorders | Negative comments | Parental influences;1;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The evidence shows that cost-push and demand-pull inflation are both present and reveals the variables at work in each case. This study fills a gap in the empirical literature by showing that labour productivity not only spurs industrial growth, but also lowers consumer goods inflation in the long run. The policy implication of this finding is important given the need to attain faster economic growth without sacrificing price stability.;Consumer goods | Econometric models | Economic analysis | Industrial production | Inflation | Mexico;0;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Therefore it is necessary to complete the accustomed ‘internalist’ histories of science with the research on its sociopolitical contexts, and specially, the past and actual North-South divide. The intensification of contacts among Latin American anthropological traditions since the nineties is producing comparative visions of anthropological science and foster ‘decolonial’ perspectives (a specific Latin American version of Postcoloniality). The model of ‘cultural control’, which combines the analysis of symbolic processes with that of power relations may constitute a way out of the long during invisibility of Latin American anthropologies and empower them as parts of a diverse and multipolar world anthropology.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

At each stage of the methodology a series of tasks are defined together with methods and techniques to build the ontology considering quality characteristics. Description logics is used as the formal language during design, a set of informal competency questions is used to support ontology conceptualization; at the evaluation stage, the set of questions are translated to a formal reasoning language and are used for evaluation purposes. Many methodologies and tools have been reported in literature, but little attention has been paid in the creation of consistent, modular, coherent, usable and reusable ontologies as an objective from the beginning of the design process.

Therefore, this paper presents a computational approach to the extraction and analysis of suicide causes from news reports in Spanish. The automatic extraction of suicide causes is carried out through linguistic markers based on verbs, connectors, prepositions and conjunctions. On the other hand, the analysis of the suicides causes is performed in two approaches: a) an analysis focused on verbal and noun phrases, studying the presence of the negation; b) an analysis on the frequency about unigrams or bigrams of words. Both analyzes show promising and correlated results, which are useful for recognizing the suicide causes reported in Mexico in a given period.

It explains how legal, religious and political frameworks that were considered valid in Mexico between 2015-17 determined that products of those technologies could be considered ""unborn"" or ""conceived"" ""children"" or ""babies,"" among other names. The fertilized ovule therefore appears both in discourse and in spoken language under terms that evoke subjective and relational aspects.

While online and offline gaming may produce undesired negative effects on players, we know little about the nosology of IGD and its prevalence, especially in countries with emerging economies. Methods: A self-administered survey has been employed to estimate prevalence of DSM-5 IGD and study the structure and performance of an instrument in Spanish to measure DSM-5 IGD among 7,022 first-year students in 5 Mexican universities that participated in the University Project for Healthy Students (PUERTAS), part of the World Health Organization’s World Mental Health International College Student Initiative. Results: The scale for IGD showed unidimensionality with factor loadings between 0.694 and 0.838 and a Cronbach’s α = .816. Items derived from gaming and from substance disorders symptoms mixed together. We found a 12-month prevalence of IGD of 5.2% in the total sample; prevalence was different for males (10.2%) and females (1.2%), but similar for ages 18–19 years (5.0%) and age 20+ (5.8%) years. Among gamers, the prevalence was 8.6%. Students with IGD were more likely to report lifetime psychological or medical treatment [OR = 1.8 (1.4–2.4)] and any severe role impairment [OR = 2.4 (1.7–3.3)]. Adding any severe role impairment to the diagnostic criteria decreased the 12-month prevalence of IGD to 0.7%. Discussion and conclusions: Prevalence of DSM-5 IGD and the performance of diagnostic criteria in this Mexican sample were within the bounds of what is reported elsewhere. Importantly, about one in every seven students with IGD showed levels of impairment that would qualify them for treatment under DSM-5.";College students | DSM-5 | Epidemiology | Gaming | Mexico;11;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;CB 285548;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

A large part of university engineering and science careers include the teaching of chemistry within their curricula, including, most of the time, chemistry lab experiments, generally described in a lab manual experiments, consisting of a series of specific activities, in accordance with their learning objectives. Although the instructions of the lab manual experiments must be written in a clear and understandable way for the students and make it easier to the instructor to explain the development of each of them, the use of flow charts in a similar way to other technological subjects, outlining the activities to be carried out during this process, can be of great help because it allows visualizing all or part of it. Flow charts are sometimes part of the reports of the chemistry lab experiments requested to the students to evaluate their work, or they are elaborated and presented by the instructors, but in this case, each of the students should bring a previous flow chart describing step by step all their activities, with very good results, what was observed during lab work as well as in the contents of its reports and in their grades.;Chemistry | Educational Innovation | Flow chart | Lab experiments;0;0;;;;undefined;

It is crucial that a student initially identify the situations of the environment in which they will develop their professional activities, in addition to recognizing the fundamental characteristics of sustainable development. Once this objective is achieved, he will be able to establish a relationship between these factors and any project that involves engineering. This target may be accomplished with the use of a qualitative tool, the SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats); in Spanish, they allude to strengths, opportunities, weaknesses and threats. Even if it is a tool that can be considered simple, it allows to get a general perspective of the strategic situation of any organization. The SWOT analysis estimates the effect that a strategy has on the balance or adjustment of and organization, considering both, its internal capacity and the external situation (Thompson and Strikland, 1998). In this case, the possibility of applying this tool to projects in which sustainable development was involved was considered, that means, its characteristics can be identified and related to the dimensions: social, economic and environmental. As a result, working in teams made up of students from different engineering careers and with different projects selected by themselves, they elaborated diagrams, revealed their viability and issued reasoned evaluations, once they made the analysis of each delimited project.";Active Learning | Analysis of Projects | SWOT Tool;0;0;;;;undefined;

It allows the definition of a price, the determination of a form of payment and the design of the best terms for the technology transfer to interested companies. The most common methods for technology valuation (cost, market and income) are used in companies as well as in universities and research centers. Its application faces different situations and problems, depending on who applies them and where. Despite the abundant literature on the subject, few empirical studies have been published on the difficulties that hinder the valuation of technologies in universities. The objective of this work is to identify the main difficulties faced by technology managers when they value technologies developed in universities, in order to understand the problem and offer proposals for improvement. Our research suggests that in the process of valuation of this type of technologies it is common to find difficulties that can be grouped into four factors: a) Lack of information, b) Little knowledge about valuation methods, c) Level of technology development, and d) Business practice of technology acquisition.;Difficulties | Technology transfer | Technology valuation | Valuation of technology;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The objective of this work is to analyze the role of the scientific and inventive capabilities generated in the universities, as a requirement to promote effective processes of knowledge and technology transfer to the productive sector. With this, we seeks to contribute to the understanding of how an effective linkage between universities and the companies can be fostered to create and develop innovative products through the transfer of technology. We analyse the experience of the Institute of Biomedical Research of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, one of the most important universities in Latin America (IIBm-UNAM). This university research center (URC) stands out in the Mexican context for its relevant generation of scientific and inventive capabilities. It is concluded that for the knowledge created in the universities to materialize in new products and / or processes marketable by the productive sector, it is crucial that there are complementary capabilities between the university and the companies. In this process two driving forces are identified. The first “science push” requires from universities to generate scientific and inventive capabilities that enable new scientific and technological developments, as well as the capabilities to manage and transfer that knowledge. The second “demand pull”, requires that companies generate capabilities to identify, use and assimilate the scientific and technological university developments. Both processes enable the transfer of knowledge and technology from universities to the productive sector.;Capabilities | Health | Knowledge transfer | Mexico | Technology transfer | U niversity r esearch centers | Universities-firm l inkages;3;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;CB2015-258387;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The present study explores how the problem of soft budget constraint can also arise when incomplete fiscal decentralization is combined with divergent fiscal policies of the central and local governments. Methodology: We construct a model in which each level of government is assigned a fiscal-behavior function that responds to three possibilities. Based upon that model, we formalize a dynamic, non-cooperative game of fiscal competition between the two levels of government. We then determine the combination of policies that constitute the model’s equilibrium. Results: We show that budget constraint softens when incomplete fiscal decentralization is combined with opposing fiscal policies at the local and central levels of government. In addition, the vicious circle of fiscal irresponsibility and bailouts of local governments is a Nash equilibrium. Conclusions: In economies with strong fiscal imbalances, and in which an efficient (i.e. complete) decentralization cannot be carried out, soft budget constraint becomes a significant moral-hazard problem that inevitably degrades a nation’s societal well-being.;Bailout | Incomplete fiscal decentralization | Nash equilibrium | Soft budget constraint;1;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Such responding usually manifests as a tendency that opposes that of a stimulus that predicts the outcome, also known as a conditioned excitor. Some learning theorists have expressed concerns about the validity and usefulness of conditioned inhibition as a concept; claims that may have negatively affected the reputation of this research area. This article offers a contemporary review of critiques of and controversies over conditioned inhibition and of arguments advanced in its defense. Some of these disputes have been reported in previous reviews, but here we have sought to compile the most representative among them. We also propose new arguments that answer some of those critiques. We then address the most prominent theoretical accounts of conditioned inhibition, identifying commonalities and differences among some of them. Finally, we review recent studies of conditioned inhibition. Some of the new findings contribute to rejecting early critiques of conditioned inhibition and others further elucidate the nature of this phenomenon. A new set of studies suggests that a deficit in conditioned inhibition characterizes some psychiatric conditions, illustrating its translational importance. We believe that new generations of researchers will benefit from being aware of past controversies and how they may have shaped the current conception of conditioned inhibition.";Animal behavior | Associative learning | Learning theories | Pavlovian conditioning | Response inhibition;14;0;;;CONACYT;592937;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

For economic analysis, this need calls for modeling frameworks capable of representing the particularities of the relationship between economic systems and water resources in terms of appropriation from natural sources, utilization by production processes, and generation, treatment, reuse, and discharge of wastewater. We explore an integration of these particularities into an input-output model of the economy designed for technological choice featuring resource endowments as production constraints. We apply the model for studying the intentional reuse of treated wastewater in the regional economy of the Mexico Valley Basin, whose highly intervened hydrology is compromised by unsustainable exploitation of natural sources and minimal treatment of wastewater flows. We design scenarios for testing the response of the economic system to the constraining of groundwater extraction by aquifer recharge and to the reduction of leaks in domestic networks. Our findings indicate that avoiding aquifer overexploitation requires treatment processes to generate up to 1.4 km3yr−1 of high quality water for intentional reuse, while the control of domestic leaks can reduce regional water intake by 13% and, therefore, reduce the required treatment effort to 0.9 km3yr−1. The extent to which these results can support the design of a strategy for water sustainability with empirical relevance for this region ultimately depends on accurate representations of treatment technologies and conveyance infrastructure in economic models. We suggest that detailed representations of technologies for water distribution and wastewater treatment into economy-wide analysis constitute an important field of collaboration for industrial ecologists and input-output economists for the near future.;Input-output economics | Mexico Valley Basin | Wastewater reuse | Wastewater treatment | Water sustainability;39;0;;;SEP;COLMEX-PTC-059;Secretaría de Educación Pública

This discourse is based on a distinction between the pure and the impure, the good and the bad, and the sacred and the profane, and it is linked with the cultural imaginary that lends a particular meaning to social acts. In this case, the analysis of the binary narrative of self-defense groups in Tierra Caliente (Michoacán) allowed interpretations to be made regarding regional armed social action in a national setting, shaped by the government discourse that blames organized crime for national public insecurity.;binary narratives | performance | rural police | self-defense groups | violence;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

In this article we argue that these reforms, widely inspired by the global New Public Management movement and its aftermath, take shape in a difficult encounter with both the traditional public administration model in Mexico and tensions endemic to the aforementioned reform movement as attempts to enhance system integration coincide with procedural disorganization. This results in a paradoxical internationalization of the Mexican health-care system due to which the above objectives may be difficult to achieve. To illustrate our argument, we examine the Mexican case through the lens of experience two European countries (Germany and Norway) in which reforms have affected the health-care system in a similar way.;Europe | Germany | Governance | Health Policy | Health-Care | Healthcare Reform | Internationalization | Mexico | New Public Management | Norway | Public Administration | Regulation;0;0;;;;undefined;

Through the identification of actors and determining factors/facts for the generation of this type of innovation, structural causal relationships behind inclusive products innovation are extracted and profiled. Evidence suggests that inclusive innovations in developing countries depend on public financing and require systemic interaction within multiple social actors, where interactive learning is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the generation and sustainability of innovations. The lack of economic incentives for companies is identified as a major obstacle for public policy to become a tool that allows articulating public-private interests.

The results point to a long-term relationship in both periods, but with a sign opposite of the expected sign in the latter, suggesting that the deceleration of industrial capital can explain the slowdown over the past three decades. This result is confirmed with the decline of manufacturing, as well as other economic indicators. The causality tests demonstrate two-way causality between the two variables, evincing a virtuous cycle between growth and accumulation.;Capital accumulation | Economic growth | Industrialization | Investment | Panel data;1;0;;;;undefined;

In this paper, a mobile AR system is proposed which helps in the understanding of resistive electric circuits for undergraduate engineering students. The designed system employs a smartphone, a measuring instrument, and a resistive circuit on a breadboard. The smartphone captures a photograph of the electric circuit and receives data from the measuring instrument (current and voltage) to calculate theoretical values and generate a layer of virtual objects which is then merged with the original image and displayed on the screen of the smartphone. In order to display the AR, a markless method is developed for a typical circuit for identifying resistors in a circuit and set virtual objects over it. The developed circuit displays (via AR) the theoretical current, voltage, power, and their measured values, as well as the error for each parameter. Technical efficiency of the developed system is 98%.

These models use a variety of deterministic, heuristic, probabilistic and statistical methods at local or regional levels. In all cases, the evaluation of the efficiency of the model to predict the gravitational processes is key to ensure their reliability in the land-use management and planning. To this end, the susceptibility model should be compared with a detailed and accurate inventory of landslides. This research used the La Carbonera basin fluvial system, located in the southeast slope of the Pico de Orizaba volcano, Mexico, to evaluate the models and explain the comparison techniques. The study area has physiographic conditions that are susceptible to gravitational processes due to the combination of several factors, such as high rainfall during the rainy season, the intrinsic susceptibility of the existing types of rocks and deposits (poorly consolidated volcaniclastic deposits and weathered rocks, as well as folded and fractured sedimentary rocks), steep slopes and changes in land use. Within the study area, landslides and debris flows occur frequently. These two phenomena adversely affect human settlements and economic activities. In Mexico, there are few detailed maps on an inventory of landslides, geospatial databases of these processes, and susceptibility maps that could be used systematically to compare and contrast the limitations and advantages of the models for any region of the country. In addition, the evaluation of a model under natural conditions is a difficult issue due to the complexity of the natural and technical problems associated with it. The model performance may be compromised by natural issues such as the masking landslides by vegetation, the combination of several different types of landslides and processes, etc., in addition to technical issues including a poor DEM resolution, the sampling strategy selected, the collection and calculation of geotechnical parameters, the lack of a complete and detailed inventory, etc. The lack of a systematic comparison of the susceptibility models not only compromises the reliability of these models, but also leads to the abuse in their use. In order to alleviate some of these issues, this study built a detailed inventory of landslides based on two series of digital aerial photographs and field work. Landslides were digitized and incorporated into the GIS, and a geospatial database was developed for a better description. Field work and interpretation allowed the cartographic representation of 236 landslide processes. This inventory sets the framework for qualitative and quantitative comparisons, with two susceptibility maps created with a cartographic-hydrological model (SINMAP). SINMAP was selected because in the literature it is considered that its analysis is fairly successful in defining areas that intuitively seem to be susceptible to landslides in regions with scarce information. With the landslide inventory and the cartographic-hydrological susceptibility model, this work provides a comprehensive assessment of different comparison techniques to highlight the advantages and limitations of each. To this end, the model was run using specific geotechnical data for the study area and predefined geotechnical data. Different comparison techniques (receiver operational feature, overall model accuracy, odds ratio and different precision values obtained from a confounding matrix) were used under the LOGISNET system and the SPSS statistical program. The results of this work set the advantages and limitations of the comparison techniques, as well as their use in the assessment of the model efficiency to predict landslides. The assessment showed that the overall precision and the odds ratio should be evaluated in parallel with other precisions (user and producer precision, and model efficiency), as their values are strongly influenced by the most common class, usually those pixels that represent ""stable areas"". The characteristic receiver operating curve (ROC) is a better technique for use in an overall assessment of models, and can be used even to define precise and objective cut-off levels to classify maps into ""stable"" and ""unstable"" areas. The ROC curve and the producer precision showed a greater predictive capacity for SINMAP using geotechnical data specific to the study area (70.8% and 67.26%, respectively) relative to SINMAP using predefined geotechnical data (34.4% and 38.46%, respectively). The low user precision value for both, i.e. SINMAP using specific geotechnical data and SINMAP using predefined geotechnical data, was further confirmed by its large negative value in the model efficiency test in areas with landslides, showing that models poorly predict landslide pixels. This is due to the fact that the model tends to be over-predictive. The fieldwork supports that the susceptibility map drawn based on SINMAP with specific geotechnical data is considerably better than the one from SINMAP model with geotechnical data predefined by the system. The areas with over-prediction can potentially be affected by future landslides, as these areas are located on or near existing landslides.";Evaluation models | La Carbonera watershed | Landslides | Pico de Orizaba volcano | SIG;1;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The evidence across econometric techniques and sample periods systematically indicates that: (i) a real depreciation of the yuan-dollar exchange rate reduces Mexican manufacturing exports by lowering the price of Chinese goods in the US market; (ii) a depreciation of the peso-dollar real exchange rate generates a strong supply-side effect due to the high import content of Mexican manufacturing exports, which ultimately leads to lower (rather than higher) sales in the US; and (iii) external demand and labour productivity are positively related to manufacturing exports, whereas real wages are negatively related. Therefore, a falling external demand for Mexican manufacturing products or a real depreciation of the Chinese currency could, to some extent, be offset by increasing labour productivity faster than wages. These findings reflect two fundamental problems of the Mexican economy: (i) low investment in high-quality formal instruction and proper training programs, which gives rise to severe bottleneck points for faster labour productivity growth and (ii) excessive reliance of the export-oriented manufacturing industry on foreign suppliers of intermediate inputs.";China | manufacturing exports | Mexico;2;0;;;;undefined;

Reflections on the telescope appear in the context of deliberations on the world system, on the possibility of the existence of life forms on the Moon and other celestial bodies, and in the context of polemic against Aristotelian cosmology. The telescope is an element of religious deliberations concerning eschatology and those focused on astronomy, whose aspiration to get to know the universe is motivated by secular curiosity. The matter of conducting observations of the sky with the use of the telescope has turned into a comedy show, in a satirical way relating to the practice of astrology.;Academic literature | Polish literature | Scientific revolution | The history of astronomy | The popularization of science | The telescope;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

The local authorities have attempted to stall the process of environmental degradation with ambitious reforestation plans, proposing the use of non-native species such as eucalyptus. The urban agricultural production space is derived from the livestock practices that existed before the process of urbanization. The dominant population in the urban space is a heterogeneous local or migrant one which has maintained its own culture, and the lack of agricultural space has ensured that animals are culturally and socially linked to the human environment.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

However, empirical research that goes beyond verifying the existence of causality, to investigate the direction, intensity, and mechanisms that explain those causal links is still a green field (Foster and Pyka 2014). Investment in the public goods associated with science, technology, and innovation (STI) activities depends on a country’s available public resources, which opens up a causal loop that may be associated with either growth and welfare or poverty traps. This interaction between investment in STI and growth remains at the core of many theoretical discussions, especially in developing countries, where this investment is expected to drive economic growth, sustain catching up processes, and assist in poverty alleviation.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

It briefly analyzes the two preeminent civilizatory projects or attractors of modernity—capitalism and socialism—as a result of the general law of the evolution of modern society since 1648/1789. The construction of twentieth-century socialism—the second attractor of modernity—by Lenin and Mao and the respective communist parties in Russia and China, is the topic of the following sections. The demise of the second attractor in Russia and the discussion of the transitional perspectives of China’s revolution close the analysis of “The Past and Present of World Socialism.” The second part, “The Future of World Socialism,” studies the inherent evolutionary logic of the world system and the potential for the appearance of collective transitional subjects, capable of achieving a trans-capitalist phase change towards a non-chrematistic political economy and a participatory democracy. The third part examines the potential of China to become the new liberating socialist subject of mankind and the last one poses the question of whether a cyber-socialist evolution of Marx’s paradigm is necessary, due to the revolution of productive forces of the industrial age towards those of the twenty-first-century digital civilization.;October Revolution | twenty-first-century socialism | world socialism;1;0;;;;undefined;

Participants (N = 102) were asked to work in teams to carry out a research project and prepare an abstract which they sent to an international conference. Teams were video and audio recorded as they worked on their project, and the data were analyzed following the precepts of interaction analysis.

The paper analyzes the perspectives of undergraduate students about a questionnaire with which they periodically assess the performance of their professors, to judge their relevance and usefulness as an evaluation tool. It is a qualitative research through the case study modality. The case was represented by the Xochimilco and Cuajimalpa Units of the Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM). The theoretical perspective of teacher evaluation is also placed in a framework of qualitative and comprehensive evaluation. The results are grouped into three blocks referring to the teacher evaluation questionnaire that the students answer: 1) student opinions on the questionnaire, 2) uses of the results of the teacher evaluation, and 3) proposal to evaluate the teaching performance. Among the conclusions, it is emphasized that the evaluation process is associated in a priority way with the granting of economic stimuli to teachers and tangentially with the improvement of the quality of teaching. This situation disagrees with a very extended vision that links the results of the teacher evaluation with the improvement of education.;Evaluation | Higher education | Students | Teachers;6;0;;;;undefined;Institute of Education Sciences

To make this idea more explicit, flowcharts are used, showing the influence of the decisions taken from a hypothesis (Scientific Method), and its relation with the basic principles of Values Education.

Wawiłow implements the particularly strongly individualized variation of linguism.

The loosening of collective and role-based modes of recognition and existential security has meant that, to an increasing extent, love has become the most signi?cant source of people’s ‘ontological rootedness’ (May 2011) or ‘ontological security’ (Giddens 1992). For instance, while conceding that it seems to be a universal fact that love is a source of self-enhancement, Eva Illouz argues that ‘the sense of self-worth provided by love in modern relationships is of particular and acute importance, precisely because at stake in contemporary individualism is the dificulty to establish one’s self-worth and because the pressure for self-di?erentiation and developing a sense of uniqueness has considerably increased with modernity’ (2012: 112; cf. Beck and Beck-Gernsheim 1995; Gunnarsson 2014a; Gunnarsson 1994, 2011; Luhmann 1998). Luc Ferry goes as far as stating that the world is currently going through a ‘revolution of love’. When fewer and fewer believe in values like God, the Nation or the Revolution, the only thing in which basically everyone believes is love. Although love, as the new great principle of meaning against which to measure the ‘good life’, revolves around the private sphere, Ferry states that the revolution of love has repercussions for public and political life as well. For instance, he sees the ecological movement as premised on the historically recent phenomenon of parental love, forming the basis of a concern for the lives of future generations (Ferry 2013). The long-standing feminist insight that the personal is political has now reached into the core of male-stream theorizing. The increasing social signi?cance of love is a crucial theme also in Anna Jónasdóttir’s feminist theorization of contemporary western societies, which is more specifically focused on sexual love, understood as a ‘causal power in history’. In line with Illouz and others, she argues that under current social conditions, ‘when individuals are forced/free to make and remake themselves under continuously changing circumstances, love as a source of creative/re-creative human power seems to be needed more and more strongly’ (Jónasdóttir 2011: 50). She also addresses the historically specific relation between love and the economy (cf. Bryson 2011; Hochschild 2003; Illouz 2007, 2012), tentatively proposing that ‘capital is becoming more and more dependent on recreative (as distinct from procreative) love power; and on conditioning people to use and invest their energy [and love power] to serve, directly or indirectly, continued economic growth’ (Jónasdóttir 1994: 229). The growing de facto social signi?cance of love is likely to be one crucial factor behind the increasing academic interest in love, forming the new field of what Jónasdóttir terms ‘love studies’ (Jónasdóttir 2014). While love was long an embarrassing topic for scholars aiming to be taken seriously (Toye 2010) (with literary studies and parts of philosophy as exceptions), it is now commonplace as a male-stream topic of study in many di?erent disciplines, ranging from neuroscience to political science. Given that most people would rate love as one of life’s highest values and motivators (Ferguson and Jónasdóttir 2014), as witnessed by its topicality in music, literature and art, this growing academic interest in love is important because it helps bridge the gap between academic and lay inclinations, contributing to a deeper understanding of people’s behavior and, consequently, to social life as a whole (Sayer 2011). As part of the expanding general field of love studies, a revitalized subfield of feminist love studies has begun to take shape (Ferguson and Jónasdóttir 2014). It has done so only hesitantly though, despite the fact that love is generally thought of as a feminine realm. As Margaret Toye suggests, it is probably precisely because of love’s association with ‘the realm of women, the home, the private, the apolitical, the “not serious”’ that, struggling to be taken seriously, feminist theorists feel such a ‘nervousness around the topic’ (2010: 41). However, since the organization of love under patriarchy is strongly structured by gender, contributing to the subordination of women to men (de Beauvoir 1989; Dempsey 2002; Ferguson 1989, 1991, 2012; Firestone 1970; Gunnarsson 2011, 2014a, 2014b; Illouz 2012; Jackson 2014; Jónasdóttir 1994, 2009, 2011; Langford 1999; Thagaard 1997) and privileging heterosexual love over same-sex love (Butler 1990; Ferguson 1989, 1991; Jackson 2006; Rich 1980), it remains centrally important that feminist theorists take part in shaping the field of love studies. As part of the generally growing signi?cance of love in late modern societies, love also seems to be becoming an increasingly important arena of gender struggle (Jónasdóttir 2009). As a result of formal gender equality and the relative decline in women’s economic dependence on men, we have entered an era in which many middle and upper class women, above all but not exclusively in the West/North, remain bound to men only by the bonds of sexual attraction and love (Giddens 1992; Gunnarsson 2014a; Jónasdóttir 1994 [1991]). The implications of this have not been su?ciently explored by feminist theorists. What are the mechanisms of power internal to love? And what is it that motivates women to continue to attach themselves to men, even when this is not necessitated by economic and other constraints? In other words, what kind(s) of power is the power of love? And what di?erence does it make in and for feminist theory and politics? In the feminist work on love that does exist, especially as part of second wave feminism, the dominant way to explain women’s choice to attach themselves to men in the name of love, even when this implies subordination and the draining of women’s powers, has been by recourse to notions of patriarchal ideology or discourse. With some exceptions (e.g. Leon 1978; Sarachild 1978; Willis 1980), the recurrent theme of second wave feminist discourse on love was to conceive of heterosexual love as a delusion or false consciousness, ensuring that women continue to submit to men (Atkinson 1974; The Feminists 1973; Firestone 1970; see Douglas 1990, Jónasdóttir 2014, and Grossi this volume for overviews). As bell hooks puts forward, this feminist tendency to reduce love to a matter of patriarchal ideology has led to the alienation of most women from feminism. For hooks, to see love itself as the problem was a mistake of second wave feminists. ‘We were to do away with love and put in its place a concern with gaining rights and power’, she states, highlighting that this inhibited the development of a more complex feminist theorization of love. ‘Rather than rethinking love and insisting on its importance and value, feminist discourse on love simply stopped’ (2000: 102). Highlighting that the emergence of love studies as a new research field has so far been driven to a large extent by male mainstream theorists, Jónasdóttir echoes hook’s plea for more feminist inquiries into love. Since love is ‘one of the most vital, and dificult - not the least for women, matters to deal with in practical life and in theory, it should be particularly urgent for feminists to be (pro)active in this area’ (Jónasdóttir 2014: 25). Although ideological notions of compulsory heterosexual love, bound up with norms of femininity and masculinity, are of course immensely important as vehicles reproducing heterosexuality as a dominant system with associated gendered power relations, this book departs from tendencies of reducing love to ideology or discourse. A central assumption structuring the book is that although love is a crucial site of (in particular) gendered power asymmetries, it is also a vital source of human enhancement that we cannot, in its basic form, live without. Refraining from tendencies in much work on love to emphasize either love’s oppressive or enhancing qualities and implications (see Gunnarsson 2011, 2014a), the book puts the dualities, dynamics, and contradictions of love center stage, in the conviction that love’s indisputable power can be organized in both mutually enhancing and egalitarian and oppressive and exploitative ways.

Despite this context, human beings strive to be in loving relationships. It is true that marriage rates are declining, but statistics on cohabitation show it is a growing phenomenon all around the world (Baker and Elizabeth 2014; Solís 2013). Puzzled by this state of a?airs we ask why this is so. If ‘love hurts’ (Illouz 2012), if violence takes place within relationships, and if ‘loving’ relationships can have harmful consequences for families and society, why do we keep searching for them? Here, we want to show that loving bonds can give joy/pleasure, personal development or a world of stable comfort; they can also give us a sense of membership and expectations that entice us to pursue them. Of course, these bonds can be both enabling and constraining. The account presented here tries to understand not only why love hurts when a relationship is called o? or when the loved one dies, but also why love relationships can create bonds that are dificult to end because they involve people’s own sense of being and identity. The contemporary loving experience between lovers is a complex process. It involves sexual attraction, being in love, and having more or less stable bonds. Additionally, the relationship between lovers can be examined from numerous perspectives, which include - but are not limited to - culture, sexual preference, and a number of partakers. Given the complexity of the topic at hand, we will focus on western heterosexual couples, a contemporary version of romantic love, and the moment in which a bond between at least two persons is formed. We are aware that this is not the only relationship lovers can have but, for the time being, we shall devote our attention solely to this type of relationship. In this chapter, we will examine the complexity of the loving relationship through the category de?ned as the We. In doing so, we want to emphasize the idea of love as a relational phenomenon; that is, as something that involves the simultaneous collaboration of at least two individuals. Here the works of Georg Simmel and Norbert Elias are relevant for us, especially when the former suggests that ‘Lovers “have” a relationship (Verhältnis); they are as a sociological entity, “a relationship”’ (Simmel 2009: 561). Following this train of thought, we look at the loving couple through Elias’ (2003) suggestion to use pronouns in order to observe social phenomena. We have thus decided to take advantage of the We pronoun to explain the particular con?guration of a couple’s a?ective bonding (Elias 2003). More specifically, our interest lies in the special bonds that result from the We pronoun in the couple’s relationship, understood as ‘a specific con?guration of people […] [with] its specific dynamics, which are determined as much by the structure of society at large as by that of the two constituents of that society most immediately concerned’ (Elias 2003: 131). It should be noted that a couple’s affective bond is di?erent from the bonds established amongst friends, family, and acquaintances. Following Elias, the di?erence between these bonds lies in the degree of ‘intensity of identi?cation’ within the di?erent levels of the We. That is, there exist di?erent ‘emotive charges’ which depend on existing degrees of integration between couples, friends, groups, and even nations (Elias 2001: 202-203). As it has been stated, the We loving relationship (from now on, WeLR) is our starting point. It will be examined through three analytical levels. First, through love as a world of meaning (the semantics of love); then through the performative aspect of love (the situation); and ?nally, through the feelings and experiences in the individual mind-body (the enminded body [Jónasdóttir 1994: 219-221, 266 note 13]). We will present each analytical level in so far as it is related to the development of the WeLR and the bonds it entails. One ?nal remark needs to be made at this stage. The construction of the content of each level analyzed here has been done by using the extended work of sociologists such as Niklas Luhmann, Erving Go?man, and Georg Simmel. Likewise, works conducted by feminists, psychologists, anthropologists, and even neurologists have been included. Their contributions on love and loving relationships were read with the following sociological questions in mind: How is the bonding between lovers possible and desirable in our contemporary society? How do the actions of two or more participants get linked through this loving bond (i.e. the We)? And, how is this related to society in general and to experience in particular? Thus, our approach makes use of insights from other disciplines in order to answer questions that stem from a sociological perspective (for more on interdisciplinary dialogues see Jónasdóttir this volume). In what follows we present each level of analysis in order to discern what is gained (or lost) by eachmember of theWeLR in contemporary western societies. With the notion of semantics, we are proposing that love becomes a world of meaning in itself. That is, it can be seen, first and foremost, as a cultural product. Thus, love, as one social meaning amongst many others, becomes - throughout the course of history - a sphere of separated meaning (Simmel 1971).";;1;0;;;;undefined;

What is this power? Is it a form of domination? Or is it a liberating force in our contemporary societies? Within Feminism and the Power of Love lies the central argument that, although love is a crucial site of gendered power asymmetries, it is also a vital source of human empowerment that we cannot live without. Instead of emphasizing “either-or”, this enlightening title puts the dualities and contradictions of love center stage. Indeed, by offering various theoretical perspectives on what makes love such a central value and motivator for people, this title will increase one’s understanding as to why love can keep people in its grip - even when practiced in ways that deplete and oppress. In light of such analyses, the contributions within Feminism and the Power of Love present new perspectives on the conditions and characteristics of non-oppressive, mutually enhancing ways of loving. Bridging the gap between Feminist Affect Studies and Feminist Love Studies, this book will appeal to undergraduate and postgraduate students, including postdoctoral researchers, interested in fields such as women’s and gender studies, sociology, political science, philosophy, cultural studies and sexuality studies.;;4;0;;;;undefined;

Early identification of developmental delays or disabilities in children is a challenge and a global concern. In Mexico, the prevalence of childhood disability is 6%, and it is estimated that 25% of the unattended delays will have consequences on their potential. VANEDELA is a rapid screening test to detect and prevent developmental disorders in primary health care. Objective. To determine the external validity and test-retest reliability of the behavioral (DB) and reflex (DR) developmental formats of the VANEDELA screening test, compared with the diagnostic test of Gesell's Developmental Schedule Test. Method. Descriptive, transversal, and prospective study in 379 infants aged one to 24 months attending the Neurodevelopment Monitoring Laboratory / INP and the ISSSTE Tlalpan Family Medicine Clinic from 2011 to 2014. Measurements: A set of four aspects was evaluated including validity by external criteria: sensitivity, specificity, positive-negative predictive criteria, and test-retest reliability. Results. In the DB format, we found a 79% - 89% sensitivity (S) and a 83% - 95% specificity (Sp). In the DR format, a 18% - 35% sensitivity and a 81% - 96% specificity were found. Using both DB-DR formats, we found a 82% - 89% sensitivity and 72% to 91% specificity, and a test-retest reliability .62-1. Discussion and conclusion. The VANEDELA increased its validity parameters with respect to the previous assessment with adequate stability. The DB formats and the DB-DR combination of VANEDELA have an adequate validity based on external criteria, making them suitable for use in primary health care.;Diagnostic tests | Infant development | Screening | Test-retest | VANEDELA;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

San Cristobal´s experience proves advances in the discursive-ideological field, in the imaginary of indigenous empowerment, in the own claims experiences in favor of a differentiated citizenship and in the democratic institutions in the municipality. However, this context continues to be influenced by the concrete political practices of the participants, often inspired by cooptation, clientelism and corpo-ratism, dynamics that are not contributing to a real potential to modify local institutions, to implement policies of equity and propel the inclusion of indigenous political participation in the municipality.;Advocacy struggles | Ethnicity | Indigenous officials | Municipal governments | Political management;2;0;;;;undefined;

I will compare Schmitt’s interpretations of Hamlet with my own, as doing so will provide a critical view of Schmitt’s conclusions, and it will enable me to develop my own conception of myth and its relations to political theory and history.;Authority | Crisis | Decisionism | Foundations | Myths | Resonance | Significance | State;2;0;;;;undefined;

It is expected that successful products give the consumer extraordinary experiences. The research in consumption experience is growing, but much work still needs to be done to understand the food and beverage experience. A qualitative study was conducted using contextual focus groups to explore the building blocks of consumers’ drinking experience of industrial and craft beers. The results show that drinking experience is shaped by our cognitive, sensory or affective systems, especially during the core consumption experience. Elements such as attitudes, consumption habits, and individual versus social consumption, shopping experience and product benefits are also responsible for shaping the experience, but are more relevant during the pre-consumption or post-consumption experience. Gender differences occur more frequently in the affective experience, as women search more for relaxation while men for excitement and stimulation while drinking beer. When comparing industrial users versus craft, in the latter the cognitive and shopping experiences are more relevant. Overall, the results showed that the drinking experience of beers can be studied as a function of the salient human system used during product interaction, and this systems act as the building blocks of the drinking experience of beer. This information can be applied in consumer research studies to further study the experiential differences across products and consumers.;Affects | Beer | Consumption experience | Product experience;19;0;;;;undefined;

This paper aims to conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis (using bibliometric techniques) to explore the recent literature about the liquidity trap. The way in which the number of publications in the period 1973-2015 evolved points to the economic events (Japanese depression in the nineteen-nineties and the 2007-2008 global financial crisis) that revived academic interest in studying this topic.

These include the purchase of bottled water, installation of filtration devices, and other means of water purification. The demand for better water quality was tested by estimating the household’s willingness to pay (WTP), using a contingency valuation (CV) experiment through an open-format questionnaire and by estimating a censored econometric (Tobit) model. The econometric study revealed that the WTP for better water quality is influenced by variables related with distrust of the water quality provided by the City and the organoleptic characteristics of the water supply, as well as spending on bottled water or water purification technologies. The average WTP surcharge for better potable water quality is US$3.1 or 4.7% of the bimonthly water bill, which is about 0.22% of the average family income in Mexico City. The percentage of WTP to income is bigger in poor families. This suggests that improving water quality is of greater importance for lower income families. Findings are consistent with previous studies that estimated the WTP for improvements in the services that supply water to households in the city. These include reduction of inefficiency and intermittency of the supply along with water quality, improve measuring water meters, reducing the obsolescence of the infrastructure and increasing adequate maintenance. Our research is the first to estimate the WTP for better water quality in Mexico City and constitutes a reference point for those that address the problem of water quality and its impact on the welfare and income of families.;Contingent valuation | Mexico City’ water quality | Perception of water quality | WTP for clean water;19;1;repositoryam;Green;ISTA;120-2015;Institute of Science and Technology Austria

The movement's electoral engagement led to internal crisis, and demobilisation following the PRI's return to power. After its creation at a private university, the movement became the first nationwide student movement since 1968. It will be argued that the internal tension between democratisation and electoral inclination and engagement did not allow the movement to develop autonomously from the party system nor to organise around its own political agenda.;#YoSoy132 | democratisation | electoral engagement | Mexican Spring | students' movement;0;0;;;;undefined;

However, there is a lack of environmental studies on the use of CO2 from process stream within the oil and gas industries. The carbon balance of an enhanced oil recovery project for the specific case of using CO2 process stream of ammonia production from emission factors and regional databases in the Mexican oil and gas sector was assessed. Two independent tools to assess life cycle assessment according to guidelines ISO 14040/14044 were utilized: (i) use of Umberto software to quantify the environmental impact with ReCiPe model midpoint; and, (ii) The American Petroleum Institute method through the use of emissions factor for each source and emission gas of the activity/facility in a spread sheet. The results of the tools were compared and the dissimilarities analysed. The emissions profiles from all direct and indirect activities associated with the enhanced oil recovery system were compared with a “cradle-to-grave” model. The functional unit is one barrel of crude oil extracted and consumed. Global warming as the environmental indicator of both tools was used. Additionally, the energy balance of the project was estimated. The global warming impact of the enhanced oil recovery system was 0.51 tCO2e/barrel (bbl) using the American Petroleum Institute tool, whilst the emissions using Umberto software were 0.54 tCO2e/bbl. Also, for each MJ of energy produced a value of 72 tCO2e/MJ oil and of 66 tCO2e/MJ oil, were obtained. This study demonstrates that both tools delivered an accurate estimation of the greenhouse gas emissions in the enhanced oil recovery system for the oil and gas industries. However, American Petroleum Institute has the advantage that the calculations can be performed ´manually' in a spread sheet using emissions factor adjusted to the facilities and Country. Regarding the results of both tools, this work shows that American Petroleum Institute results have proven to be an efficient tool for practitioners and researchers that intend to analyse the greenhouse gas emission of carbon capture utilization and storage systems to estimate, with accuracy, the global warming impact.";Ammonia production | Carbon balance | Crave to grave model | Global warming impact;7;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

By implementing ultra-expansionary monetary policies, the industrial economies drive down interest rates, while the emerging economies tighten their monetary policies by raising rates, thus generating a burgeoning foreign-currency carry trade. Vulnerability is caused by the sudden reversal of such capital flows or the high cost of insuring against this by accumulating reserves. This paper estimates that the cost of reserve accumulation between 2008 and 2014 averaged 1.83% of GDP, so the free capital mobility espoused by the Mexican authorities makes it very costly to play by the rules of financial globalization.;Capital movements | Costs | Foreign exchange | Foreign exchange markets | Mexico | Monetary policy | Monetary reserves;1;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

As interpreted by the authors of the article Mitzner’s poem fills a poetic gap in narrations about the activity of the Centre and its seats, in particular the more recent one – Dom Słów (House of Words, in Żmigród Street) and in a specific way – i.e. by resorting to poetic abbreviation – condenses the mission fulfilled by Lublin institutions involved in regaining memory about the town’s Jewish residents. Mitzner described a place where during the inter-war period the foundations of both cultures were reinforced both literally and metaphorically, and which was the site of print shops; today, the “Grodzka Gate – NN Theatre” Centre brings us closer to the history and arcana of the art of printing and the book as well as the history of an independent publishing movement in 1976–1989, topics on which the House of Words concentrates its diverse educational activity.

A lagging performance of exports vis-à-vis imports in terms of magnitude, growth rate as well as price reductions has led to the current deficit. Domestic industrial output is a determining factor in the extent of foreign trade of capital goods. It exposes very large coefficients in the long term for exports (2.89), as well as for imports (4.34). Concerning the effective exchange rate, coefficients are systematically negative and elastic. Hence, a depreciation of the dollar could further deteriorate the external accounts of this sector. The United States trade deficit is expected to continue. As a whole, it is based on a mutual need: it fulfills the private interests of the incumbent parties.;Capital goods | Effective exchange rate | Industrial output | U.S. trade deficit;0;0;;;;undefined;

They range from civilizing monolingualism (fast transition or submersion), through civilizing bilingualism (still transition) to reach the identity bilingualism of our times. The ideological shift that nurtures a new language policy moves away from traditional orientations of diversity as a threat to national unity towards an enrichment perspective, which regards identity bilingualism as a positive option to promote Indigenous languages and cultures.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

This strategy includes 17 goals (no poverty; zero hunger; good health and well being; quality education; gender equality; clean water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; climate action; life below water; life on land; peace, justice and strong institutions; and partnerships for the goals), and 169 targets that are integrated together and are non divisible, and which cover environmental, social and economic aspects. To achieve these goals and targets it is necessary that governments and civil society participate together. México is one of the countries that signed the Agenda 2030. It is characterized by its big extension (1'973,000 km2) and population (123.5 millions), low economic growth of 2.3% in 2016 (El Economista, 2017), a high poverty level of 43.6% (Coneval, 2016), and a huge biodiversity (fifth place worldwide according to Llorente-Bousquets y Ocegueda, 2008). Because of this complex situation, it is particularly important to assess the contribution of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to Mexican sustainability. Thus, the objective of the this paper is to propose a general overview of the development of the Mexican NGOs, and to analyse the degree of coincidence of their activities with the UN Agenda 2030's framework for sustainable development. We use a framework close to constructivism and principally qualitative methods, including analysing and researching documentary information and statistic data, while maintaining an interdisciplinary perspective to study the three fundamental sustainability aspects (environmental, social and economic). The information sources included mainly NGOs web pages, the Ministry of Government (Segob), the Social Development Institute (Indesol), complemented with direct information provided by different stakeholders from the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat) and NGOs', which provide different perspectives. We began by identifying the NGOs and their regional localization. Mexican national records have more than 30,000 NGOs (according to Indesol). The NGOs activity in México is regulated by the law called Ley Federal de Fomento a las Actividades Realizadas por Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil (LFFAROSC), approved in 2004. This law establishes 19 NGOs activities, and activity number 12 relates to sustainable development (SD) and includes: advice for the use of natural resources; environmental, flora and fauna protection; preservation and restoration of the ecological balance; as well as, sustainable development promotion at regional and community levels in urban and rural areas. We work with a subgroup of 5,636 NGOs related to SD, based on activity 12 of LFFAROSC. Later, we reduce the group to 21 NGOs recognized for their contribution at national level and which have accessible information. These 21 cases where selected by the characterization of a set of variables including their activities, their age and experience, their relationship with the government and the civil society, as well as, the origin of their resources. Then, the contribution from their activities to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals included in the Agenda 2030 is analysed. It was found that the Mexican NGOs had fast growth and that they have been focused on activity 12 of the LFFAROSC. Also the goals proposed in the Agenda 2030 related to the sustainable cities and communities, life on land, responsible consumption and production, quality education, and affordable and clean energy are covered by the NGOs. In contrast, some of the goals are not the main focus of the analysed NGOs, such as: no poverty, zero hunger, reduced inequalities and quality education (in addition to environmental awareness), among others. Nevertheless, these goals may be covered by NGOs that work in other LFFAROSC activities. Other goals that are not contemplated by the law, particularly those related to economic and political topics (decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; and peace, justice and strong institutions), where NGOs have less possibility to act. Hence, these responsibilities depended mostly on the government. In summary, the NGOs contribution to achieve the goals of the Agenda 2030 is relevant in the national context and fundamental in some country regions with less support for governmental programs. There are some limitations to this study: 1) the 21 NGOs selected for the analysis are not representative of the complete NGOs universe related to SD; 2) the variables used for the analysis where helpful according to the objective of this paper, specialty the description of the NGOs activities, the experience, their relationship with government and civil society, as well as the origin of the resources. Nevertheless, it will be helpful to have data about financial and human resources availability (volunteers and remunerated); and 3) with regards to the production of knowledge of the NGOs, we only did a general description of the variety of documents that they use for the diffusion of knowledge, but a deeper content analysis is necessary to think about quality and utility. The work presented constitutes a first approach to the contribution of the main NGOs activities to SD in México. Further research could look at an impact evaluation that identify, quantify, explain and assess the influence to the country in the light of the goals of the UN Agenda 2030.";Assessment | México | Non-Governmental Organizations | Sustainable Development Goals;9;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Dissatisfied with existent theorizations of hegemony, I will be drawing on the critical edition of Gramsci's Quaderni and attempt to offer a new perspective regarding the conceptualization thereof. Thus applying the elaborated framework of analysis to the current situation, I argue that unlike the US's ability to counter the challenge of its traditional imperial rivals Germany and Japan as they developed under the grip of US hegemony, the country is facing difficulties in countering China's ascent. However, while maintaining that China does indeed represent a challenge to US hegemony, particularly in East Asia, I will argue that the idea of a ""crisis of US hegemony"" is premature as China remains distant from fully realizing hegemonic relations, even at the regional level.";China | Contender states | Geopolitical autonomy | Gramsci | Hegemony | International political economy;3;0;;;;undefined;

To accomplish this aim, a survey research was conducted in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru (n = 1039). Results show significant relationships between ideological expressions with some dimensions of identity. The authoritarian ideology is positively related to the identity components, whereas the social dominance ideology is inversely related to them. Relations among the components of identity and well-being have a positive association, and these relationships are more intense in the case of social well-being than in the case of subjective well-being. Nevertheless, some heterogeneity in these relations is observed by comparing countries. A general model of the relations among variables derived from three constructs was proposed, but this did not reach acceptable fit levels, being dismissed.

Design/methodology/approach: In order to compare the performance of the proposed algorithms, they were tested on eight instances drawn from the Mexican electoral institute database, and their respective performance levels were compared. In addition, a simulated annealing-based (simulated annealing – SA) algorithm was used as reference to evaluate the proposed algorithms. This technique was included in this work because it has been used for Federal districting in Mexico since 1994. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated in terms of the quality of the approximated Pareto front and efficiency. Regarding solution quality, convergence and dispersion of the resulting non-dominated solutions were evaluated. Findings: The results show that the quality and diversification of non-dominated solutions generated by population-based algorithms are better than those produced by Federal Electoral Institute’s (IFE’s) SA-based technique. More accurately, among population-based techniques, discrete adaptation of ABC and MMC outperform PSO. Originality/value: The performance of three population-based techniques was evaluated for the districting problem. In this paper, the authors used the objective function proposed by the Mexican IFE, a weight aggregation function that seeks for a districting plan that represents the best balance between population equality and compactness. However, the weighting factors can be modified by political agreements; thus, the authors decided to produce a set of efficient solutions, using different weighting factors for the computational experiments. This way, the best algorithm will produce high quality solutions no matter the weighting factors used for a real districting process. The computational experiments proved that the proposed artificial bee colony and method of musical composition-based algorithms produce better quality efficient solutions than its counterparts. These results show that population-based algorithms can outperform traditional local search strategies. Besides, as far as we know, this is the first time that the method of musical composition is used for this kind of problems.";Artificial bee colony | Districting | Method of musical composition | Particle swarm optimization | Simulated annealing;3;0;;;;undefined;

Body mass index was associated with a lower probability of sarcopenia applying SMI or CC (OR 0.75, P = 0.002 for SMI and OR 0.71, P = 0.004 for CC). Sarcopenia evaluated either with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or CC was not associated with physical performance, such as five times chair stand test, timed up and go test and short physical performance battery. Additionally, SMI was not associated with physical performance, five times chair stand test (P = 0.775) and timed up-and-go test (P = 0.341). Conclusions: The prevalence of sarcopenia in active elderly women was low. A higher prevalence of sarcopenia was detected using SMI compared with CC. It is important to identify the best methods to assess skeletal muscle mass to obtain a reliable diagnosis of sarcopenia.

The designed structures and public policies to provide waste management services in Mexico City have been exceeded. A significant increase in demand has led the government of Mexico City to base public services on rudimentary techniques using obsolete equipment. The modernization of waste disposal facilities and the diversification of services linked to waste treatment can offer several business opportunities to optimize energy generation from solid wastes. The use of landfills to dispose large amounts of waste enables the energy generation from biogas. The energy generated can diversify the electricity market and provide economic benefits to landfills managers to cover operational costs.;Biogas | clean energy | landfill | MSW | sustainability;6;0;;;;undefined;

This study aimed to examine the association among depression symptoms, emotional eating, and body mass index (BMI) in Mexican college students; and to assess emotional eating as mediator between depressive symptoms and BMI. A total of 1453 students at a public university in Mexico City completed the scale Self-Efficacy in Emotion- and Stress- Related Eating of the Eating and Appraisal Due to Emotions and Stress Questionnaire (EADES) to assess emotional eating, and the scale created by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES-D) to identify depressive symptoms. Weight and height were measured to calculate BMI. Structural equation models (SEM) were used to assess emotional eating as mediator between depressive symptoms and BMI by sex. Depressive symptoms were associated with emotional eating in both men (Beta = −0.33, p < 0.001) and women (Beta = −0.46, p < 0.001). Emotional eating, in turn, was associated with BMI in men (Beta = −0.08, p < 0.001) as well as in women (Beta = −0.09, p < 0.001). Emotional eating was a mediator between depression and BMI, adjusted for age in both sexes.

In 1964, the Mexican state enforced its legal claim to pre-Hispanic material culture as national property by removing a colossal pre-Hispanic monolith from its lands and transporting it to the capital’s National Anthropology Museum. Ever since, the stone sculpture that represents an ancient rain deity has stood at the entrance of the museum as an emblem of Mexico’s ancestral indigenous heritage or patrimonio. For the residents of Coatlinchan, however, the monolith’s removal brought about ecological and social disruptions: drought and other forms of scarcity which profoundly altered their town and its surrounding landscape. In this article, I draw on an ecological framework to explore the productive effects of dispossession and absence in Coatlinchan. Rather than analyzing its residents’ loss as that of a bounded artifact, I argue that material traces from the re-Hispanic past are embedded within and integral to webs of environmental, material, and social relations that are essential for the production and reproduction of life itself.;Absence | Archaeology | Dispossession | Ecology | Heritage | Material culture | Property;6;0;;;;undefined;

The methodology raises an epistemological critique of the traditional research among indigenous peoples. The results summarize the main features of dual immersion education of children and young Mapuche based on their parents’ speeches.

Then it gives a brief overview of the language policy challenges faced by universities to cope with neoliberal internationalisation. A conceptualisation of the domain as a sociological (Bourdieu) and communicational (Gumperz) field is sketched to interpret LPP activities in a comprehensive framework. Next the text turns to the micro-level to give a more detailed account of two specific universities, Unidad Profesional Interdisciplinaria en Ingeniería y Tecnologías Avanzadas (UPIITA), a technology unit in the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) in Mexico City, and the University of Latin American Integration (UNILA) in southern Brazil. The analysis of both universities reveals the emergence of exceptional plurilingual LPP frameworks: The Mexican UPIITA fosters the learning of more than one foreign language to cope with research and study abroad activities. The Brazilian UNILA integrates students from all over South American through teaching in Portuguese and Spanish as equal languages of instruction. English and other international languages come third as access languages to the international academia. Finally, the article relates its findings to the more general picture of university LPP in Latin America.;higher education | Language policy | Latin America | plurilingual universities | science;11;0;;;;undefined;

These problems include the disequilibrium in the balance of payments that turned into a banking crisis, which concluded with the abandonment of the gold standard and the establishment of bank notes as legal tender. The civil war and the deterioration of the economy continued progressively during the following years and at the end of the 1920s resulted in the bankruptcy of the majority of the banks comprising the Porfirian banking system.;Abandonment of the gold standard | Banking crisis | Banking system | Bankruptcy | Civil war | Legal tender;1;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Within the MMC, models of social influence and social learning are used and integrated in a social network, which is composed of a set of individuals with links between them and involves a set of interaction rules. In this paper, a comparative study on the performance of the MMC with different network structures is proposed. Sixteen benchmark nonlinear optimization problems are solved, taking into account nine social topologies, which are: (a) linear, (b) tree, (c) star, (d) ring, (e) platoons, (f) von Neumann, (g) full connection, (h) random and (i) small world. In addition, the update of each topology structure was tested according to four different strategies: one static, two dynamic and one self-adaptive states. An exhaustive statistical analysis of the obtained numerical results indicates that the social dynamics has no significant impact on the MMC’s behavior. However, the topology structures can be classified into groups that consistently influence the performance level of the MMC. More precisely, a structure characterized by a low value of its mean number of neighbors and a rather fast information transfer process (star topology) performs in a radically opposite way as structures where each agent has many neighbors (random and complete topologies). These observations allow to provide some guidelines for the selection of a network topology used within a social algorithm.;Multi-agent search systems | Network topologies | Non-linear optimization;9;0;;;;undefined;

Today, the prevailing mentality in the West, which tends to become a universal worldview, has much in common with the beliefs of the ancient Gnostics. according to this mindset, science and technology can allow the human mind to escape the limitations that characterize its natural state, releasing the anchor to biological stuff and escaping the human condition. In short, we would become gods-gods thought of as Immortal Super-Engineers. We must resist these destructive illusions and delusions, which means: technical rationality has to make his own critique of utopian reason (in the sense of Franz hinkelammert). Without this self-criticism, a judicious use of techniques and technologies will be out of reach- and they do have an enormous potential for improving the human condition-, while avoiding-if it were still possible-the exterminist, nihilistic and suicidal drift of industrial civilization.;Biotechnology | Critique of utopian reason | Genetic engineering | Gnosticism | Human immortality | Nanotechnology | Synthetic biology | Technical rationality;1;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

After identifying strategic, relevant and secondary actors, we find that technical standards are treated primarily as a competitiveness factor. We thus characterize the process of regulating nanotechnologies in Mexico as a case of “subordinated governance” in which international rules of operation and technical standards are reproduced in the narrow Mexican regulatory framework.

Methods The English language literature on Medline, PsychInfo, Google Scholar, and public-use databases was searched for original articles, critical review reports, and public use data on cannabis use and suicide for the period ranging from 1990-2015 (February). Odds ratios (OR) from random effects in meta-analyses for any cannabis use and heavy cannabis use were calculated. Results The acute cannabis-suicidality literature mostly includes descriptive toxicology reports. In terms of death by suicide, the average positive cannabis rate was 9.50% for studies sampling from all suicides, with higher cannabis detection rates amongst suicide decedents by non-overdose methods. We found only 4 studies providing estimates for any chronic cannabis use and death by suicide (OR=2.56 (1.25-5.27)). After deleting duplicates we found 6 studies on any cannabis use and suicide ideation (OR=1.43 (1.13-1.83)), 5 studies on heavy cannabis use and suicide ideation (OR=2.53 (1.00-6.39)), 6 studies on any cannabis use and suicide attempt (OR=2.23 (1.24-4.00)) and 6 studies on heavy cannabis use and suicide attempt (OR=3.20 (1.72-5.94)). Conclusions We currently lack evidence that acute cannabis use increases imminent risk for suicidality. The evidence tends to support that chronic cannabis use can predict suicidality, but the lack of homogeneity in the measurement of cannabis exposure and, in some instances, the lack of systematic control for known risk factors tempered this finding.;;114;0;;;;undefined;

It is a sacred territory fir the Huichol population and culture, not only fir its long history, but also because of its active role in the expression of their religion through a particular shamanic practice, one that is immersed in a dynamic syncretism with the popular Christian spirituality. The Huichol (Wixaritari) tribe is best known fir its traditional medicinal practices and rituals involving the use ofpeyote (Lophophora Williamsii), a hallucinogenic cactus native to northern Mexico and the southern USA. In this desert land a constant exchange of giftsfir thepeyote spirit takes place; nevertheless, contemporary Huichol religious practices maintain a significant relationship with Christian popular practice. Moreover, the increasing and constant presence of globalization has deeply marked the Huichol population, triggering conflict situations as a result of foreign predation in the region. In this context, the global dynamics in the twenty-first century take on a negative role fir the Huichol, particularly since these parameters have contributed to the invasion by foreign mining corporations throughout the Huichol land, with the Mexican government selling sacred and ancestral territory, resulting in the displacement of the Huichol population.";;0;0;;;;undefined;

Particularly, one main goal is to promote innovation and development through entrepreneurship and start-ups. One relevant way to do this, are training programmes on entrepreneurship and innovation management Many HEI offers this kind of program at a national level. Unfortunately, they have a very different level of quality and in many cases lack of relation will be cultural and economic local conditions, mostly for SME. Two international initiatives cooperate to create a new offer for this social need, using innovative approaches on social networking and distance learning education. Those initiatives are, by one side the University Industry Network (UIN) and by the other one the EMundus Project. This paper reports the main objectives of both initiatives and the joint project they are working on for a pilot experience for training on entrepreneurship and innovation management, based on a virtual institutional network for distributed blended learning, with an Open Education approach and OER Tools.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

This article argues that some animal species, especially primates, have the ability to grasp the material world in a meaningful, i.e., intentional way and display complex types of behaviour that makes it plausible to assume that they have inferential capacities. The physiological similarities between many animal species and human beings allow to establish that those similarities also hold on the cognitive level of sensory knowledge. Thus, if human beings are able to perform certain inferential tasks based solely on sensory information, so can those animals on account of their physiological similarities, namely because they have sense organs and a structured brain that houses the inner senses which are needed to perform those activities. This leads to the idea that, if some animal species engaged in mental activities similar to human mental activities, then they could be said to perform complex tasks, such as basic forms of thinking. But since animals do not have a conceptual apparatus at their disposal, their acts of thinking, or rather proto-thinking, would have to be non-conceptual. Hence, for Albert the Great intelligence in nature manifests itself in various degrees and it does not entail a Cartesian dualistic hiatus between mind and matter.;Animal Life | Animal Species | Intentional Content | Mentalmental Content | Minor Premise;7;0;;;;undefined;

Health insurance with explicit service packages has not fulfilled their purposes of universal coverage, equal access to necessary health services and improvement of health conditions but has opened health as a field of profit making for insurance companies and private health providers. The national health services as a state obligation have developed territorialized health services and widened substantially timely access to the majority of the population. The adoption of an integrated and wide social policy has an impact on population well fare.

The cultural manifestations acquire formal structure from specific functions: myth, tale, and rite are some of the most common. From such perspective and therefore, semiotics observes the ritualization forms from its presence in different cultures as a way of organizing the universal meaning to achieve its communicative specificity. Continuity between forms is observed due to the principle of Narrativity, that is to say, information organized in a logical way in order to communicate. A rite consists of a manifestation of a ritual form, an abstract meaning that is formed in a process able to be transmitted, kept, and communicated to the members of a culture. A rite is defined as a complex meaning unit formed by minor units. The rite is therefore a dynamic structure with the capacity to privilege the structural organization of the composing elements and the combinable sequences as effect of meaning, global organization of meaning and relations allow identifying a collection of values as in transition rites. Every rite displays values, element combination and sequences, and organizational forms, constructing a micro-universe of meaning with the capacity to reproduce the transcendental meaning, which motivates it. The present work has the objective of presenting the rite as a way of narration with composing elements in different planes: i) occurring of the tale, ii) transmission of transcendental values; iii) macro-tale compound by micro-tales each with specific works and functions1.";Meaning | Ritual | Social methods | Storytelling process;0;0;;;;undefined;

The problem is circumscribed to the destabilization of identity as something that is given and relatively secure, and to a growing interest in being considered as an objective and means of the management’s regulatory efforts. The qualitative research was conducted in the form of case of study, in a company named Comercial Nutresa S.A.S., located in Medellin, Colombia. From the critical and multidisciplinary perspective in Organizational Studies, organizational identity was defined as a dialogue between the organization and the middle managers. The findings that constitute middle management process of identity construction were: recognition, transcendence, and security. Upon analysing their relations and meanings for middle managers, it can be stated that organizational identity is a liminal process where in the combination of factors involved in the process form a non-structural space where change, resistance, and constant significance characterise the organizational identity of middle managers in the organization that has been studied.;Liminal | Middle managers | Organizational identity | Organizational studies | Organizations;2;0;;;;undefined;

The analysis shows that the distinction between performative and non performative utterances is relevant for the description of prometer and jurar: Although prometer is mainly used as commissive, its assertive use is greater in performative than in non performative utterances.

Since the introduction of these protective frameworks, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and queer (LGBTIQ) communities, allies, and advocates in the country have won major legal battles on these issues; however, in spite of these successes, LGBTIQ communities continue to face hostility and violence. As a result, South African LGBTIQ individuals often travel to urban centres, such as Johannesburg, in the hope that these spaces will be more tolerant of their sexual orientation and gender identity; the reality, however, suggests otherwise. Moreover, despite South Africa’s designation as a safe haven for LGBTIQ communities, migrants from other African countries — where same-sex relationships are criminalised — are overwhelmingly met with xenophobic verbal, emotional, physical, and political violence. This article describes the authors’ engagement with nine lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) migrants and asylum seekers from Zimbabwe, Malawi, and elsewhere in South Africa during a weeklong poetry workshop exploring their lived experiences in Johannesburg. This workshop followed a body mapping and narrative writing workshop held previously with the same participants. This article investigates the themes identified from the body mapping process that guided the poems produced: migration, violence, citizenship, and freedom. The poetry created during the workshop illuminates how lesbian, gay, and bisexual migrants in Johannesburg work on a daily basis to build social trust as they demand to be seen and recognised, to enact their rights, to make and remake homes, to show up in public as Black people, as LGB individuals, and as human beings. We explore these strategies of citizen-making as informed by the LGB poets with whom we had the opportunity to work.";citizenship | LGBTIQ | migration | participatory methodologies | poetry | South Africa;12;1;repositoryvor;Green;OSF;undefined;Open Society Foundations

The research question guiding our analysis was Do campaign positions neutralize or reinforce gender stereotypes? We rely on a specialized literature in order to understand the issues related to gender and its connections to electoral disputes. The empirical analysis was done through content analysis and measured the presence of the theme of ""woman"" in said television spots. We also analyze the position chosen in other aspects of television ads, assessing the presence of three main codes: iconic, linguistic, and sonorous. The results show that the agenda of gender-related issues has concentrated on ads dealing with motherhood and job creation. In order to overcome gender stereotypes, the candidates were presented in agreement with the attributes perceived as necessary for political leadership, with an emphasis placed on traditionally masculine traits such as self-determination, seriousness, intelligence, competence, and leadership.

Method: We studied three groups of 16 participants each: elementary school children (CG), undergraduate students (UG), and graduate students (GG). Parents and participants granted their consent. The EEG was recorded (Nicolet) following the 10/20 system. Bipolar samples were analyzed. Absolute power (AP) was obtained with Fourier transform; its average (AAP) relative power (RP), and slow/fast frequencies and indices were calculated. Differences were assessed with Kruskal Wallis and Dunnet&#39;s comparison for subgroups. Results: The AAP of six frequencies was higher in CG than in UG and GG. Frequencies were similar with exceptions correlating with topographic distribution. The d/a index was higher in CG with a particular topographic distribution, ?/a varied more. RP of a was higher in UG and GG than in CG; that of ? and d were higher in some leads of CG. Discussion and conclusion: During cerebral maturation, AP diminishes due to integration of more glial-neuronal ensembles, presenting greater asymmetry in a giving frequency.

Zapatismo became the point of reference of the fledgling anti-globalization movement, with its global network and heterogeneous structure. The strength of the Zapatista network was precisely that it showed the potential of digital technologies for weaving political links and fostering debate, learning, and mutual learning among social movements. It was in those years and around Chiapas that the first reflections about the Internet and its possibilities for building coalitions and distributing networks for struggles emerged.

In this study, we developed a synthetic conceptual framework of urban households' responses to climate-related hazards, and conducted a preliminary analysis of its applicability using household survey data from four major Latin American cities (Bogotá, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Mexico City, Mexico; and Santiago, Chile). The analysis revealed that variables measuring perceived impacts and the sensitivity and social asset aspects of social vulnerability were particularly related with household response to the safety and health risks of climate hazards.

Methods: Household surveys were conducted, using area probability sampling of 1565 Mexican-American residents, aged 18-65, living at the Texas-Mexico border in the metropolitan areas of Laredo and McAllen/Brownsville. Results: Among those 18-29, more frequent crossing of the border was significantly predictive of AUD (OR=1.61, p < 0.01) and co-occurring heavy drinking and drug use (OR=1.70, p < 0.01). Staying more than one full day was predictive of AUD (OR. =. 3.07, p. <. 0.001) and crossing to obtain over-the-counter or prescription drugs (""drug tourism"") or for nightlife/drinking were predictive of heavy drinking (ORs = 4.14, p < 0.001; 3.92, p < 0.01, respectively), AUD (ORs = 7.56, p < 0.001; 7.68, p < 0.01, respectively) and co-occurring heavy drinking and drug use (ORs = 8.53, p < 0.01; 4.96, p < 0.01, respectively).

Just as foreign investors, British and American, and foreign skilled workers, mostly American, played an important role in the establishment of Mexico’s first railroad companies, these same foreign businesses brought their written rule books, necessary for the impersonal management of labor in companies with large, diverse, and a far-flung labor force like the railroads, to Mexico. The first rules are often Spanish translations of the English-language originals and paid no attention to the workers’ opinions. Through the Porfiriato, however, Mexican railroad workers unionized, in part following the pattern of the American Brotherhoods, and their unions, through labor activism and strikes, fought to transform work rules from company commands to negotiated terrain, with some success before the Revolution broke out. When the Revolution did break out, however, it radically transformed the terrain of work rules, first because railroad companies, even before they collapsed in the face of revolutionary violence, lost the support of the state that they so needed to impose their work rules, and second, because the new state that emerged from the Revolution allied with organized workers to provide them with many of their revolutionary demands: legal trade unions, mandated work benefits, and collective bargaining. Thus, newly powerful railroad unions through strikes and activism and in alliance with the new state made work rules not only negotiated terrain between companies and workers, but terrain in which workers and their unions held the upper hand. As a consequence, the work rules of 1923, where unions are powerful and impose significant benefits to workers, bear little resemblance to those of 1883, where unions are not recognized by the companies, which felt no obligation to provide any benefits at all.;Mexican revolution | Mexico | railroads | unions | work rules;0;0;;;;undefined;

Most of the evidence is based on the case of Mexico, a Latin American country that is also an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member. Despite the belief that Latin American countries tend to pay less for their skilled workers than developed countries, they invest a considerable amount of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in education and sometimes in scholarships abroad. Therefore, our main question is: Are skill prices really so proportionately low in Latin America? Likewise, what are the impacts of skills prices on migration in Latin America, and Mexico in particular? And, what is the importance of “brain drain” in terms of the relationship between migration and education? We find that despite the enormous inequality in the region, skills prices are not low. Furthermore, high expenditures on education combined with low skills prices do not necessarily result in brain drain. Other factors, such as perceptions of insecurity and corruption, have a stronger effect on the migration of Mexican professionals. Likewise, although high skills prices may lead to economic development, they may also increase social inequality, leading to greater brain drain. Therefore, the expansion of higher education is recommendable even if it reduces salaries and wage premiums in the short term.;Brain drain | Educational planning | Mexicans | Policy analysis | Skilled workers;2;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Granger causality tests show that the industrial production of the United States causes Mexican manufacturing production. A VAR econometric model which has U.S. industrial production as an exogenous variable indicates that the real exchange rate has a negative short-run effect on Mexican manufacturing production, and that fiscal and monetary policies have a small effect on manufacturing output. Moreover, it shows that these policies have been pro-cyclical in the past. To counter negative effects from international economic crises Mexico needs to develop a stronger domestic market and be able to forge counter cyclical monetary and fiscal policies.;Domestic market | Granger causality | Industrial production | International financial crisis | Subprime mortgage derivatives;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

With the advent of Neoliberalism many thought that it was the end of corporatism (how monopolist of labor force against free market or that bargaining labor conditions against the market). That was not the case, but anyway this corporatism changed. Introduction of polemic of diversity of capitalism is parallel to diversity of corporatism in the same country. To illustrate the above, we show the transformation of corporatism in Mexico in a context of mature neoliberalism.;Corporatism | Diversity of capitalisms | Diversity of corporatisms;0;0;;;;undefined;

Social movements and organizations, especially autonomist indigenous ones, attempt to persuade the public that dissent is a right and a proper form for thinking about the political. The social construction of dissent as a crime not only is promoted by state regimes but also seeks to be accepted, legitimated, and sustained by the society. Socially deconstructing it requires considering the law as a historical production, connecting its analysis to legitimacy, and recognizing its ideological and fictional dimension and the influence of structural conditions such as the organization of production.;Autonomy | Dissent | Human rights | Indigenous movements | Resistance;0;0;;;;undefined;

To face this challenge, the European Union (EU) has set the so-called 2020 Horizon as one of its main objectives: limiting the emission of greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, satisfying 20% of all energy needs through renewable sources, and improving energy efficiency by 20% (The European Union 2012). The last projection forecast in 2012 by the European Environmental Agency (EEA) established that Spain was one of the countries in the EU furthest from reaching these objectives (The European Union 2013). As a result, implementing measures devised to meet the 2020 objectives is currently a priority for the Spanish government. In recent decades, the housing sector has played a decisive role in increasing global energy demands and greenhouse gas emissions (Nejat et al. 2015). In 2014 Spain’s housing sector’s energy consumption needs represented 19% of total national consumption and 31% of the electricity demand (IDAE 2013). Starting from the design phase, reduction in energy consumption per square meter has become a prerequisite for the majority of buildings (Parameshwaran et al. 2012; Koo et al. 2014). The importance and urgency exhibited by the EU housing sector in achieving the government objectives outlined in the 2020 Horizon have led the energy market to show a clear trend towards buildings with higher energy performance in the future (Shimschar et al. 2011). Similarly, the success factor of energy efficiency initiatives will depend to a large degree on the method or the indicators used when measuring energy performance in each building (Abu Bakar et al. 2015; Day and Gunderson 2015). As a result, selecting one energy evaluation methodology over another can be decisive in the path taken by Spain, change the current perception of the country, and increase Spain’s standing within the EU. Several studies (Feist et al. 2005; Schnieders and Hermelink 2006; Mahdavi and Doppelbauer 2010; Mlakar and Strancar 2011; Hatt et al. 2012; Dahlstrøm et al. 2012; Dequaire 2012; Proietti et al. 2013; Ridley et al. 2013; Stoian et al. 2013; Moran et al. 2014; O’Kelly et al. 2014) indicate that the Passivhaus standard (PS) can be used as a highly effective tool in both limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing building energy efficiency. Other studies (Audenaert et al. 2008; Moeseke 2011; Allacker and De Troyer 2013; McLeod et al. 2013; Mlecnik 2013; Stephan et al. 2013) challenge the adoption of the PS because they consider other options within the energy market to be better from both environmental and financial perspectives. Nonetheless, the precursors to the PS claim that the benefits of the standard can be replicated in any part of the world through its use during the design phase (Feist 2014; Passive House Institute 2010, 2015; Passipedia 2015). The main objective of this study was to analyze the viability of using PS through the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) tool in the Spanish housing sector, focusing on its use in the Mediterranean climate in the Province of Barcelona. To that end, we selected an isolated semidetached home, that exhibits the typical characteristics of current Spanish housing so that any possible deficiencies or virtues of adopting the PS are easily observable. The study was conducted using 3 construction proposals (PC, P1, and P2); the initial proposal (PC) is defined by conventional construction technology, while the remaining 2 proposals (P1 and P2) offer different construction alternatives focused on optimization (window glass, the building envelope, and improved installations), enabling evaluation of the PS criteria compliance. To test the ease of obtaining PS compliance without the need for changing the architectural design of the project, the design and space distribution of the PC alternative remained the same for the P1 and P2 options.";Construction costs | Energy efficiency | Mediterranean climate | Passivhaus standard | PHPP;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

However, recent work suggests that this process of adaptation is yet more complex and uneven. It is our contention that subsidiary policy on labour relations is not simply the product of adaptation from and to home and host institutional environments but is in fact shaped by the multiple power relations that characterize multinational company subsidiaries. This three country comparison between Argentina, Canada, and Mexico shows that a policy of strong engagement with trade unions requires the presence of actors that can mobilize power resources. It is when both management and workers have power resources that subsidiaries are more likely to develop a policy of strong engagement with trade unions.;Comparative industrial relations | employment relations | labour relations | multinational companies | trade unions;6;0;;;UNDP;55210;United Nations Development Programme

Whereas after the Industrial Revolution work processes tended to be autonomous from the living environments of production agents, in recent decades a trend in the opposite direction has been observed in some companies. This re-articulation takes place at several levels: a) through the blurring of the boundaries that separate work and everyday life, b) through the reintegration of affective dimensions into work processes, c) in promoting reciprocity and sociability in the economic sphere and d) in the production of meaningful experiences at work. Are we witnessing an emancipating balance between life and work? Or, on the contrary, is private life being colonized by the sphere of production? In this paper we seek to explore a third form of analysis, that of reflexive modernity.;Daily life | Ethnography | Job attitude | Job satisfaction | Organizational change | Working time;8;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

At times, this term takes priority over such notions as mestizaje, syncretism, creolization, and transculturation. Studies on hybridity open the way to gaining a deeper critical insight into the diversified development of societies, their mixing patterns, and the intercultural movements of hegemony and resistance.;Creolization | Globalization and world culture | Multiculturalism | Multiculturalism, Anthropology | Paradigms in the social sciences | Religion: culture contact | Specialization and Recombination of specialties in the social sciences | Syncretism;2;0;;;;undefined;

Their construction, beyond their architecture, became part of a solution serving the political and social needs of the Church. Through this idea we consider these structures as being symbols of the balance, sometimes conflicting, sometimes collaborative between the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the national governments at that historical moment. This chapter seeks to understand how the Catholic Church has taken this style and used it, directly or indirectly, as an additional element in a complex policy of integrating itself into societies of the then-new (nineteenth century) Latin American countries. We use the geographical concept of scale as the modulating element. It allows us to structure the role of the Church on the continent in the late nineteenth century using the neo-Gothic architectural style as a pretext through three scales attached to geographical and political notions: the nation or the state, the territory, and the local. This analysis allows us to offer an outline of the spatial impact of the Catholic Church throughout the continent in the late nineteenth century.;Architecture | Geography of religion | Gothic revival | Latin America | Urbanism;1;0;;;;undefined;

Adopting key perspectives of Karl Polanyi and other thinkers, we develop our examination under the seemingly perpetual conflict between markets and social reproduction. We argue that financialization has both expanded market spaces and changed relationships within those spaces. The ever-greater domination of financial markets means that employment has become increasingly more precarious in the strict spaces of the labor market. At the same time, financialization has steadily eroded the social forms that exist outside of formal markets, greatly weakening the mechanisms through which societies can both defend themselves from predatory markets and reproduce themselves with some degree of purpose and hope for the future.;Financialization | Polanyi | Social reproduction;0;0;;;;undefined;

The complementarity between the two paradigms can grasp the complexity of social reality in which the processes of aging and current aging itself are happening; so that the articular mixed scaffolds in research design may account for various heterogeneous components involved in these processes. Mixed-methods are related to the theoretical contributions of the complex thought, and are also a tool for understanding research as aprocess that requires openness, creativity andfl exibility by the researcher to recognize the scope and limitations of both approaches. This makes us think that in the development of various research questions it is necessary to use different methodological tools, either to obtain information or analyze it. This section seeks to provide elements that contribute to the discussion about the feasibility and importance of research with mixed-methods, and how they articulate and complement each other. The fi rst section presents some debates on how there is a parceled knowledge and its consequences.

Consequently, these studies are not well supported by ecological data, or they lack an analysis of socio-ecological integration, making it difficult to implement the strategies derived from these conservation plans. Structural equations models (SEM) help with the understanding of direct and indirect interactions between variables and, consequently, allow the detection of root causes of change. In this study, a method to integrate indicators in relation to a pressure-state-response model was developed and applied to a forest in Mexico City. We developed the model using 21 environmental units, 17 state indicators of biodiversity (evaluating three aspects of the ecosystem: structure, composition and function), 14 environmental indicators (abiotic variables) and 6 anthropogenic pressure indicators. Subsequently, based on multicollinearity tests, redundant indicators were eliminated. A canonical correspondence analysis was carried out to establish the relationship between different indicators and the possible ecological connections of the SEM. With the previous information, an a priori model of the influence of pressure and environmental indicators on the structure, composition and function of the ecosystem was developed. The SEM results enabled us to evaluate the direct and indirect causes of degradation. Some environmental factors, such as the global site factor, humidity, air temperature, organic matter in the soil, slope, and soil pH, had a greater effect on the structure, composition and function indicators registered in the environmental units of the basin than other factors. The pressure factors that most affected the three aspects of the ecosystem were visitors, rubbish, fire incidence, and human activities. Pressure factors affected composition and structure indicators, though the effect on the function indicators was weak. It is possible to conclude that although the ecosystem appears to be changed by some disturbance factors, these factors have not yet altered the functionality of the ecosystem. Finally, from the model, a set of proposals and strategies for management was developed. These strategies can be used to sustain the biodiversity of each environmental unit.;Conservation status | Ecosystem management | Environmental indicators | Pressure-state-response model | Structural equation modeling | Temperate forests;31;0;;;;undefined;

First, we examine the most important concepts and practices of the neoliberal globalization. The current world situation seems to indicate that neoliberalism is not a theory, a class strategy designed to redistribute wealth upward toward an increasingly narrow fraction of people, despite national contradictions. We review sources of international tensions and some important data of transnational corporations in the North and South. Historical experiences show that crisis can produce different kinds of changes and distinct political responses in societies, such as internal violent conflicts or overt war among national-states. Some of these conflicts can be analyzed by employing two frameworks; national-states framework and global class relations. We argue that in a highly globalized world, the existence of overt war among strong nationstates could seriously damage the globalist bloc transnational commanding class, whereas internal violent conflicts can easily appear almost everywhere as a natural consequence of social and economic inequalities. In order to counterweight the crisis and fascist movements we propose alliances among the dominated classes and other dominated groups.";global capitalism | internal conflicts | Nation-states | transnational corporations | wars;0;0;;;;undefined;

Thanks to the parents report of night attacks of the witch, the myth gains a fantasy, legendary and at the same time fearful sense. Alternatively, to prevent the witch attack protection rituals were performed. In order to feel confident, at the beginning of the night, parents placed a mirror in the child's bed and scissors behind the door of the house, a crucifix and a bucket of water. Regarding the physical traces of the dead two possibilities arise: one associated with a disease and the other with suffocation.

Methods The study employed a case-crossover design with the frequency approach. Clients (N = 616) in substance abuse treatment for alcohol or cocaine issues from 2009 to 2012 completed a self-administered questionnaire on their substance use within 3 and 6 h before a recent injury or physically aggressive incident. Clients also reported detailed quantity and frequency information in relation to their typical substance use, as well as information on ""feeling effects"". The RR of acute harms due to substance use was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel estimator. Results In the 6-h window before the event, use of cocaine alone, alcohol alone and simultaneous alcohol and cocaine use were each significantly (P < 0.05) related to a recent injury and aggressive incident. Simultaneous use was not significantly greater than use of either drug alone. Estimates of RR based on simultaneous use for a 3-h window before the event were consistently larger than those based on a 6-h window, and comparisons were significant (P < 0.05) for an aggressive incident but not an injury. With reference to the two measures of exposure, three of eight comparisons of RRs were significantly larger for feeling the effects of the substance in comparison to quantity and frequency of substance use. Conclusion These findings are consistent with increased likelihood of harms related to the acute effects of alcohol alone, cocaine alone or simultaneous use. The results are suggestive that the acute effects of these drugs may be better measured within a 3-h time window than a 6-h window. Finally, we found that ""hours of feeling effects"" yielded higher estimates of RR than the quantity-frequency approach; however both measures support the overall findings.";Aggression | Alcohol | Case-crossover | Cocaine | Injury;7;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;89906;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

For example, collaborative work, multicultural teamwork, creative teamwork, entrepreneurial behavior, etc. Some authors suggest more research is needed regarding organization capabilities that promote effective relationships for innovation. According to West (2002), three issues dominated research about creativity and innovation among teams: the characteristics of group tasks and their impact in the creative-innovative process; the role of diversity in knowledge and skills between team members; and team integration. If these issues are relevant for team creativity and innovation, then frameworks and tools to configure teams are necessary. It may be taken by granted that there must be an equilibrium of roles within teams to foster creativity focused on innovation. So, in this paper several approaches of creativity are reviewed.

A strategy commonly used is differentiation, based on the innovation of products, services, processes, organizational changes, and marketing strategies. Design has also become an important element to foster innovation and is commonly used as a strategic competitive tool. However, in the case of Mexican firms, design-driven internationalization has not been strongly applied and rarely explored by the academic literature. Some information regarding the participation of México in the creative economy is presented; it occupies the 9th place among top exporters within developing economies.

Methods: Clients from five substance abuse treatment agencies presenting with a primary problem of cocaine or alcohol were classified into three groups as dependent on: (1) alcohol alone, (2) cocaine alone, or (3) both cocaine and alcohol (i.e. concurrent dependence). Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire that included details of their drug and alcohol use, physical health, mental health, social health, economic health, and demographic characteristics. Results: The concurrent group drank similar amounts of alcohol as those in the alcohol group and used similar amounts of cocaine as the cocaine group. The alcohol group had significantly (p < .05) poorer health profiles than the concurrent group across most variables of the four health domains. An exception was significantly more accidental injuries (p < .05) in the alcohol group. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, the concurrent group had significantly (p < .05) more accidental injuries, violence, and overdoses than the cocaine group. As well, the concurrent group had significantly (p < .05) higher scores on the anxiety and sexual compulsion scales than the cocaine group, controlling for demographic variables.

Compulsive consumption and the type of industrial production that predominates on today's society are the root of the problem of waste. The lack of adequate laws and standards, and corruption practices make this problem especially stubborn. Mexican society is immersed in the global phenomenon of excessive consumption and an anthropocentric belief system. The lack of investment and incentives from the Federal Government prevent the integration of appropriate actions and discourage the creation of companies dedicated to waste management; these companies also have to deal with factors such as labor unions, taxes and unfair competition. In the social sector, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to induce the separation of waste at homes. Nevertheless, the willingness of many people to take actions individually or communally inside organizations, cooperatives, NGOs, and companies can be observed; but it is necessary to integrate the isolated efforts involving major social, health, technological, environmental, and economic aspects. Thus, municipalities must form inter-municipal societies; entrepreneurs should incorporate recyclers in environmental utility companies; integrated social groups should monitor the government to issue laws that take care of the environment and not be subject to economic interests; and, highprofile professionals and scientists could be incorporated into community enterprises, inter-municipal projects, strategic R&D in renewable energy, and education. Furthermore, Mexico requires a change in paradigm to grow ecocentric-educated individuals with pro-environmental habits and customs.";Consumption | Environmental legislation | Mexico | Recycling culture | Sustainability | Waste management;1;0;;;;undefined;

In order to reach this objective I review the main figures in the Pyrrhonian tradition (from Pyrrho to Sextus) showing the evolution of Pyrrhonism from a dogmatic metaphysical position to an anti-dogmatic and anti-intellectualist epistemic stance. In each stage I analyze the way in which its representatives rejected the Socratic ideal and the way in which those rejections meant the introduction of some novel theses on the philosophical scene of Antiquity.Secondly, I use this last point in order to argue indirectly against one of the most widespread readings of Pyrrhonism, namely,that Pyrrhonism was a monolithic movement in which all of its members subscribed to exactly the same theoretical position.";;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

As writers of the Enlightenment, both authors had the philosophical concern of providing the foundations for a just international order, which would allow nations to coexist and develop peacefully. In our argument we focus upon the discursive strategies that both philosophers employ in order to present and justify their projects. A comparison is drawn between Rousseau's pragmatic approach and Kant's moral stand, stressing thereby the shortcomings of the former's position and interpreting the latter's as a robust philosophical project that can render an adequate normative basis for the goal of a perpetual peace.

Methods We analyzed data from 8 countries that participated in the World Mental Health Survey Initiative (n=47,552). We identified 6.8% and 18.9% of the sample who we think were screened out inappropriately (SCI) from the euphoric and irritable bipolar sections respectively. We compared them to those who were allowed to continue the section (CONT, 2.6% of the sample for euphoric; 1.0% for irritable) and to the reference group (REF, 69.5% of the sample). Results The SCI group had consistently higher rates of major depression (29.1% vs. 6.4%), earlier age of onset (24.3 y vs. 32.4 y), more suicide attempts (13.3% vs. 5.9%), and more episodes (4.2 vs. 2.7) than the REF for the euphoric group. Similar findings exist for the irritable group. Also, comorbidity with anxiety, disruptive behavior disorders and substance use were much higher than the REF. Limitations As with all epidemiologic studies, recall bias cannot be ruled out. Conclusions The findings above suggest that a number of the SCI subjects belong to the bipolar group. A revision of instruments used in epidemiologic research will probably prove what clinical studies have been showing that bipolar disorder is more common than has been reported. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.";Bipolar disorder | Composite International Diagnostic Interview | Diagnosis;17;0;;;NIH;4280;National Institutes of Health

In music we can find song and equivalents to instrumental playing (cicadas and crickets), theater in representing fictitious situations (killdeer's broken wing act and playing), acrobatic skills (various types of woodcocks and paradise birds) and dancing (cranes and eleonora cockatoo). I do not claim there is animal art, since the very concept of the ""artistic"" is a result of convention. What I do assert, however, is that human aesthetic appreciation did not emerge ex nihilo nor was granted by God to humans only (as Wallace believed) but has evolutionary relevance and is preceded by the zoo-aesthetics in many other species. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.";biosemiotics | evolutionary aesthetics | fitness signaling | onto-poiesis | phylo-poiesis | zoo-poetics;4;0;;;;undefined;

Injury risk associated with any (i.e., 1 drink or more) drinking 6 hours prior to injury was similar for the two control choices (last week and usual frequency). For 1-4 drinks, risk estimates were similar across control period definitions; for 5+ drinks, risk using the week prior as the control was nearly double that using the past 12 months as the control. Although studies with smaller n-sizes may benefit from the increase in precision from the use of the multiple control periods, results indicate that heavy drinking injury risk estimates should be used with caution.";Case-crossover | Control period definition | Dose-response | Relative risk;1;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Dysfunctions in the activity of the central nervous system's serotonergic function are important in understanding the pathophysiology of depression. The serotonin system is implicated in major depression and suicide and is negatively regulated by somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors is implicated in the long latency of some antidepressant treatments. Alterations in 5-HT1A receptor levels are reported in depression and suicide. In this study, we analyzed the effect of neonatal administration of CMI on the activity of 5-HT1A receptors, both pre- and post-synaptically, by administering an agonist of 5-HT1A receptors, 8-OH-DPAT, and then subjecting the rats to the forced swimming test (FST) a common procedure used to detect signs of depression in rats. Also measured were levels of the mRNA expression of 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe (DR), the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. Wistar rats were injected twice daily with CMI at doses of 15mgkg-1 or saline as vehicle (CON) via s.c. from postnatal day 8 for 14days. At 3-4months of age, one set of rats from each group (CON, CMI) was evaluated for the effect of a selective agonist to the 5-HT1A receptor subtype, 8-OH-DPAT, by testing in the FST. Also determined was the participation of the pre- or post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptor in the antidepressant-like action of 8-OH-DPAT. This involved administering an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA), and pretreatment with 8-OH-DPAT before the FST test and to evaluate the rectal temperature and locomotor activity. The expression of the mRNA of the 5-HT1A receptors was examined in the dorsal raphe nucleus, the hypothalamus and the hippocampus using the semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. The results from this study corroborate that neonatal treatment with clomipramine induces a pronounced immobility in the FST when animals reach adulthood, manifested by a significant decrease in swimming behavior, though counts of climbing behavior were not modified. This effect was similar in magnitude when 8-OH-DPAT was administered to CON group. Furthermore, the administration of 8-OH-DPAT induces a significant and similar increase in rectal temperature and locomotor activity in both the CON as in the CMI group. Neonatal treatment with CMI resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of the mRNA of the 5-HT1A receptors in the DR (% more than vehicle) in adulthood. In the case of the postsynaptic receptors located in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, neonatal treatment with CMI induced a significant increase in the mRNA expression of the 5-HT1A receptors. These data suggest that neonatal treatment with CMI induces a downregulation of the mRNA of the 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the DR, and an increment in the expression of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. The results after the administration of PCPA and 8-OH-DPAT on FST, rectal temperature and locomotor activity for both groups suggest that the function of postsynaptic receptors remains unchanged. All together these data show that the depressive behavior observed in adulthood in this animal model may be associated with long-term alterations in the expression of the mRNA of the 5-HT1A receptors. © 2013.;5-HT1A receptor | 8-OH-DPAT | Clomipramine | Depression | Forced swimming test | PCPA | RT-PCR;17;0;;;;undefined;

The earliest studies date from the 1980s and 1990s, but since the beginning of the 21st century we have seen a veritable explosion of publications on the subject. There are various reasons for this. First and foremost, the study of discourse in its own right is a recent enterprise in the Western world. Despite the important contributions of pioneers such as Mikhail Bakhtin (largely unknown in the West before his death in 1975), Michel Foucault, and linguists who dared to look beyond sentence grammar, such as Roman Jakobson, Zellig Harris, James Loriot, Kenneth Pike, and Robert Longacre in the United States (US), Michael Halliday in Australia, and Émile Benvéniste in France, discourse analysis (DA) as a collective enterprise does not start before the 1970s. DA, almost inevitably, is a confluence of differing interests, disciplines, and theoretical standpoints, a truly international enterprise in which no one single linguistic tradition can be more important than another. Its growth sprang from a desire for a broader scope for linguistic study, and richer, more socially relevant perspectives on language(s). Media discourse soon became part of that broad scope, but achieved prominence with the revolution of new electronic and digital technologies and media from the 1990s on. If the press, rather than the more recent media of radio and television, has been the focus of many media discourse studies, it is because the classical technology of typeface has moved from the printed page to the computer screen.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

A logic of accumulation of discomfort with social origin expressed in an act of abuse and mediated for a reason or conflict that justified the physical and/or verbal attack was described. Sometimes, the expression of discomfort was accompanied by guilt feelings after violent events. The expressive elements that allow abuses to partners and other family members are the beliefs about the superiority of men, the physical inferiority of women and children or the belief about their inferiority, the notion that wives are a property, the perception that relationships should last a lifetime, and beliefs about the use of violence in relationships. In terms of the intervention with this population, the study highlights the importance of considering the role of social determinants of distress from the macro level to the social programs and community interventions.;;3;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

In this context, it addresses the question of how the teaching of classical literature entered the dynamic of opposition between the political groups of the moment. The research shows the way that conservatives took classical literature and humanities as the basis of its own cultural project, while the liberals opted for a more scientific and technological education with a strong practical sense. All in all, I conclude that the cultural context played a significant role when trying to successfully build a national project in mid-nineteenth century Mexico.;Classical Studies | Conservatism | Humanism | Literature | Politics;3;0;;;;undefined;

This approach allows us to reflect about the relationship between politics and the political, which also allows us to question the need for a strong ontological foundation of the real political life. Based on some ideas of Martin Heidegger, the Being is no longer a foundation but now is conceived as an Event. In this way, is possible to think this foundation as something hidden and removed. From these ideas is then possible to consider the community in nonessentialist terms, as a contradictory reality that is only feasible if it is not feasible.;Community | Paradox | Politics | Post-foundational thought | The political;0;0;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

This situation results in the fact that economically disadvantaged people cannot have access to comfortable and energy efficient environments. This problem becomes worse in the northern regions of the country, which require air conditioning, because of the dry warm climate, for several months of the year. A proposal of a technical standard about bioclimatic buildings for warm-dry climates is presented in this paper. Also, the process for its development is described. This involves monitoring and analysis of typical dwellings in Hermosillo city in northwest México, a hot-dry climate location. The proposed regulation aims to reduce the environmental impact of the construction industry and energy use in buildings, by incorporating mandatory, optional and incentivized requirements to improve energy efficiency and the building's habitability. The proposal develops a set of articulated provisions in three main areas: efficient energy use; environmental comfort; vegetation with low water consumption in urban areas. It is intended that these regulations will apply to all new buildings, expansions and major refurbishments, once they have been incorporated into municipal regulations. © 2014 WIT Press.";Bioclimatic architecture | Bioclimatic regulations | Energy efficiency | Warm-dry climate building;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The article seeks to understand the processes of implementation of peace agreements, and how this type of operations and strategies can build and develop institutions. This involves conducting an understanding of novel institutional and conceptual implications for peace processes, and explores what they mean, how they are constructed, and how institutions and their relationship with reconstruction processes work.;Institutions | New institutionalism | Peace agreements;2;0;;;;undefined;

Thus, several states have implemented programs to sponsor its cultivation and research. This paper analyzes the policies generated by the Mexican government to promote the establishment of Jatropha plantations for biofuel purposes. The supporting schemes, the state-of-the-art national research and the environmental implications of establishing this new crop were reviewed to assess their impact on small-scale producers that participated in these programs. Scientific research on native germplasm indicates the existence of great diversity in Mexico, including non-toxic ecotypes, from which highly productive varieties are being developed. However, when the plantation programs started, producers were not technically or economically prepared to face the risks associated with this new crop, nor was there a good internal supply-chain. Consequently, some programs have been abandoned and the low productivity and income generated by the plantations have not satisfied producer expectations. Thus, there is a need to review the national strategy to support this crop and to develop a well-structured biofuel market in the country for the success of Jatropha plantations in Mexico. © 2014 by the authors.;Bioenergy policies | Mexican Jatropha | Mexican research;26;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The figure is an exact replica of a monolithic 167-ton pre-Hispanic carving, famously relocated from Coatlinchan to Mexico City's National Anthropology Museum in 1964. This consecrated replica, however, is not the first iteration of the carving constituted as a powerful being capable of producing water: in the late 1960s, the Mexican State equipped massive damns with replicas of the stone original. In this article, I argue that the monolith's multiple reproductions are intrinsic to its production as patrimonio, and part of a larger complex of Mexican patrimonial things. By examining these cases of replication, I unravel the ways in which patrimonio, a formation seemingly meant to transform ancient deities into singular heritage objects, in fact, revitalizes these objects' potential as vectors anchoring and producing locality and collectivity in contemporary Mexico. © 2014 by the American Anthropological Association.;Heritage | Locality | Mexico | Museums | Patrimony | Reproductions | Ruins | Saints;11;0;;;;undefined;

Design/methodology/approach - The approach selected was Luhmann's Social System Theory, an autopoietic decisions system. A historical case study was reconstructed in which information was recollected by in-depth interviews and a survey. The network results, the extensive communications submitted by the members of two network congresses (2006 and 2010) were analyzed by networks analysis techniques. Findings - The approach and model developed were useful to identify the decision premises, which have been the constitutional structure of the research network. Practical implications - Development of a governance approach useful to a research network organization which retro-feeds the quality movement guidelines. Originality/value - The quality movement proposes a systematic regulatory approach, via the ISO9000 standard family. This approach has not sufficed for institutions of higher education. One of the reasons is that it favors the ""management of things"" from a processes standpoint, which conforms to the General Systems Theory. However, the core of higher education is not ""things"" but rather the ""people"" participating in it - particularly professors, students, and the university community - who are participating in the creation, teaching, association, and diffusion ofknowledge. The unsolved problem refers to governance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";Decision making | Governance | Networks | Organizational theory | Quality | Quality management | Research network | Systematic auto-poetic decisions approach | Systemic thinking | Systems integration;0;0;;;;undefined;

The representative sample comprised a subsample (N = 2,362) of the urban participants of the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey (2001-2002). We used the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to assess exposure to trauma and the presence of PTSD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, ) in each respondents' self-reported worst traumatic event, as well as a randomly selected lifetime trauma. The results showed that traumatic events were extremely common in Mexico (68.8%). The estimate of lifetime PTSD in the whole population was 1.5%; among only those with a traumatic event it was 2.1%. The 12-month prevalence of PTSD in the whole population was 0.6%; among only those with a traumatic event it was 0.8%. Violence-related events were responsible for a large share of PTSD. Sexual violence, in particular, was one of the greatest risks for developing PTSD.

The World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys allow investigation of the implications of the changing criteria compared to DSM-IV and ICD-10. Methods: WMH Surveys in 13 countries asked respondents to enumerate all their lifetime traumatic events (TEs) and randomly selected one TE per respondent for PTSD assessment. DSMIV and ICD-10 PTSD were assessed for the 23,936 respondents who reported lifetime TEs in these surveys with the fully structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). DSM-5 and proposed ICD-11 criteria were approximated. Associations of the different criteria sets with indicators of clinical severity (distress-impairment, suicidality, comorbid fear-distress disorders, PTSD symptom duration) were examined to investigate the implications of using the different systems. Results: A total of 5.6% of respondents met criteria for ""broadly defined"" PTSD (i.e., full criteria in at least one diagnostic system), with prevalence ranging from 3.0% with DSM-5 to 4.4% with ICD-10. Only one-third of broadly defined cases met criteria in all four systems and another one third in only one system (narrowly defined cases). Between-system differences in indicators of clinical severity suggest that ICD-10 criteria are least strict and DSM-IV criteria most strict. The more striking result, though, is that significantly elevated indicators of clinical significance were found even for narrowly defined cases for each of the four diagnostic systems. Conclusions: These results argue for a broad definition of PTSD defined by any one of the different systems to capture all clinically significant cases of PTSD in future studies. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.";DSM-5 | DSM-IV | Epidemiology | ICD-10 | ICD-11 | Nosology | Posttraumatic stress disorder | World mental health surveys;133;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;K01MH092526;National Institutes of Health

The demotion of political participation is also characteristic of different programmes of citizenship education embracing the same dominant categories. The article argues that this tendency reveals a depoliticised approach to citizenship education, which emphasises an apolitical view on adolescents’ participation and, consequently, a conception of students as depoliticised subjects. The depoliticisation of citizenship education risks theoretical transparency in regard to the kind of participation it aims to promote and, therefore, jeopardises citizenship education's pedagogical efficacy. Drawing on political theory and philosophy, political science and sociological theory, the article analyses the scope and potential of the notion of political participation in order to develop an approach that is inclusive of adolescents, based on the development of their own politicity and especially thought for being enacted in the school as a central component of citizenship education. © 2014, SAGE Publications.

Due to their mixed organic-inorganic composition, they are usually perceived as a problematic non-biodegradable waste; nevertheless, due to their high cellulose content they could be recycled biologically in order to recover the nutrients present in them. This research assessed the feasibility of composting them along with yard waste, in 200 L bioreactors. An initial mixture of fresh trims of grass (55%), dry leaves (10%), fresh leaves (15%) and mulch (20%) was prepared and characterized to achieve an adequate C/N relationship. In the selected reactors 30% (mass basis) of previously shredded used baby diapers containing urine was added. The composting process lasted three months. Temperature, moisture, pH, nitrogen, CO2 production, organic matter, C/N ratio, volume and mass reduction were measured and recorded periodically. The composting process was not affected by the presence of diapers. Temperature rose to 60-70 °C in the initial thermophilic phase, and reached a final plateau of 20-30°C. The initial high temperatures allowed to eliminate the pathogens, as shown in the microbiological tests. Volume and mass of the substrates decreased more than 50% by the end of the process. Mass reduction for diapers was 87%, and only the plastic films were recovered. The final compost had good quality and accomplished with the limits set in the local regulation, except by pH, which has slightly above the set limit. It can be used as a soil amendment, as shown in the phytotoxicity tests performed using tomato. The results show that this is a feasible, affordable option for the valorization of used disposable diapers, which could be applied in small communities or daycare centers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.";Bioreactors | Composting | Disposable diapers | Phytotoxicity;48;0;;;CONACYT;ICyT-294-2011;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We focus on the contributions by Raul Prebisch, Celso Furtado and Juan Noyola, all of them members of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (CEPAL) during the 1950s. Prebisch used the foreign trade multiplier concept to distinguish the business cycle mechanisms at the 'centre' and at the 'periphery'. Noyola introduced the notion of external disequilibrium as a feature of the industrialization process. This was further elaborated by Prebisch's formula connecting the relative rates of growth to the ratio of income-elasticities of import. Furtado examined the implications of the external demand constraint for economic growth, an important element of the two-gap models of the 1960s. The main piece of empirical structuralist research was the CEPAL 1957 report about Mexican external disequilibrium elaborated by Furtado and Noyola, not published at the time; we discuss that report in the context of the Mexican devaluation of 1954. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.";;21;0;;;CNPq;undefined;Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico

Results indicated positive responses toward attractive other-sex targets but not toward attractive same-sex targets.

However, less is known about injuries when alcohol is used in combination with other drugs. Design and Methods: Self-report information was collected on alcohol and illicit drug use in the 6h before a violence-related injury in probability samples of patients presenting to emergency departments (n=9686). Results: Patients with violence-related injuries reported the highest rates of alcohol use (49% of men; 23% of women) and alcohol use combined with illicit drugs (8% of men; 4% of women) whereas non-violent injury patients reported lower rates of alcohol use (17% of men; 8% of women) and alcohol use combined with drugs (2% for men; 1% for women). Marijuana/hashish was the most commonly reported drug. The odds of a violent injury were increased when alcohol was used [men: odds ratio (OR)=5.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6-6.3; women: OR=4.0, 95% CI 3.0-5.5] or when alcohol was combined with illicit drug use before the injury (men: OR=6.6, 95% CI 4.7-9.3; women: OR=5.7, 95% CI=2.7-12.2) compared with non-users. No significant change in the odds of a violent injury was observed for men or women when alcohol users were compared with alcohol and drug users. Discussion and Conclusions: The positive association between alcohol and violent injury does not appear to be altered by the added use of drugs.

To examine this phenomenon, we analyze a recent Forbes Magazine annual ranking of the leading 2000 companies in the world (G2000), by grouping or 'boxing' these companies by their 62 domiciles to calculate aggregated sales, prof.its, assets and market value and correlating these quantities with the GDP of the corresponding domicile. This is an approximation to reality, since the variety of transnational capital and associated global processes make it nowadays problematic to assign national labels to capital. Regardless of where the whole business circuit takes place, we found that the GDP of each country is directly proportional, more or less, to the economic strength of all G2000 top f.irms based or registered in that country. These proportionalities tend to hover around a certain level globally, yet the correlation is lower for the 'global south' (as some describe it). We can also identify important regional variations of ratios such as prof.its/sales. Other ratios could also be easily calculated from our results. Together these f.indings help lead to a more nuanced understanding of transnational corporations (TNCs), but also suggest more basically, for instance, that the 'global north' remains to some degree more penetrated by TNCs (of the G2000). © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.;business domicile | global capitalism | global profits | statistical correlations | transnational capitalist class | transnational corporations;6;0;;;;undefined;

Findings substantiate that collaboration between PRO and other actors are too weak.

At the site of La Joya, one of the many earthen sites of Central and Southern Veracruz, pyramids, palaces, and ball courts of a size equalling or surpassing contemporaneous stone constructions, were erected and modified during the first millennium AD. For the first time in Mexican research, the combined efforts of archaeologists, architects, restorers, chemists, geologists, and biologists permit understanding the techniques that made these constructions possible in the tropical environment. Our paper focuses on a new reconstruction of the building sequence of the East Palace Annex at La Joya, to emphasize the quality of the architecture and the importance of this underrated heritage.

This paper develops a framework to understand the political-economic determinants of institutional response capacity through an examination of climate change governance in Mexico City and Santiago, Chile. We ask whether being a frontrunner (Mexico City) is an indicator of greater institutional response capacity. Although Mexico City has slightly higher levels of institutional capacity than Santiago, both are faced with similar challenges, such as fragmented governance arrangements, asymmetries in access to information, and topdown decision making. However, both also have similar opportunities, such as leadership, participation in transnational networks, and potential to integrate climate change goals into existing policy agendas. Examining urban climate change planning in isolation from other institutions is therefore likely to provide a false sense of a city's response capacity.;Climate change responses | Institutional capacity | Latin America | Urban;40;0;;;;undefined;

The formation of the SociedadMexicana de Educación Comparada in 2004 has led to increased comparative education activity, theory-building, research, and publication by Mexican scholars, however. Most professors define comparative or international education based on their research context. In the early 21st century in Mexico, the research context is largely one of decentralization of education in different Mexican states. The future of comparative education inMexico is likely to be characterized by an increase in funding for education research by diverse government agencies, international organizations, and private foundations. It is debatable whether a transformation of comparative education teaching and pedagogy will occur, but the envisaged increase in research may influence the academic publications studied in comparative education courses in Mexico.

In this article, traditional silvopastoral systems with cattle are characterized, and 35 pastures with silvopastoral management in communities of the Lower Grijalva hydrographic region of Chiapas and Tabasco in Southeastern Mexico are evaluated. This article discusses the general context as well as technical and economic aspects of the cattle raising units (CRU). The high frequency (71%) of land use conversion from maize fields to pastures demonstrates that a significant process of increased establishment of cattle raising is under way. Pastures have an average age of 17.9 years, soils are of medium to high quality, and the dominant herbaceous species are grasses. Scattered trees (ST) in pastures are remnants of the original vegetation which has largely disappeared due to change in land use, with 53 species belonging to 24 botanical families and an average density of 12.3 trees ha-1. In living fences (LF), 32 tree species belonging to 18 botanical families were found, with an average density of 45.8 trees per 100 linear m. It is estimated that on average, one hectare of pasture with a dominance of Cynodon plectostachyus grass (13.10 Mg C ha-1) surrounded by a living fence (7.28 Mg C ha-1) and containing scattered trees (3.00 Mg C ha-1) has a total accumulation of 23.38 Mg C ha-1. Finally, provision of several environmental services, levels of production or yields, and animal products of the CRU with treeless pastures and with two types of silvopastoral systems are analyzed. In order to be considered a form of sustainable development, traditional silvopastoral systems must gradually be transformed into intensive silvopastoral systems. This requires the commitment and co-responsibility of all social actors involved in order to plan community-based, municipal, state-wide, and national policy related to agroforestry with an animal component.";Carbon capture | Cattle production | Environmental services | Living fences | Scattered trees | Soils;34;0;;;CONACYT;143303;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This work explores the issue of alcohol recall bias used in the case-crossover design. Design and Methods: Data were collected on injury patients from emergency room studies across six countries (Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama and Canada), conducted in 2009-2011, each with n≈500 except Canada (n=249). Recall bias was evaluated comparing drinking during two control periods: the same six hours period the day before versus the week before injury. Results: A greater likelihood of drinking yesterday compared with last week was seen using data from the Dominican Republic, while lower likelihood of drinking yesterday was found in Guatemala and Nicaragua. When the data from all six countries were combined, no differential drinking between the two control periods was observed. Discussion and Conclusions: These findings are in contrast to earlier studies showing a downward recall bias of drinking, and suggest that it may be premature to dismiss the last week case-crossover method as a valid approach to estimating risk of injury related to drinking. However, the heterogeneity across countries suggests that there may be some unexplained measurement error beyond random sampling error. [Ye Y, Bond JC, Cherpitel CJ, Borges G, Monteiro M, Vallance K.

The international comparison is used to interrogate whether such a practice model is transnational, displaying shared characteristics that transcend contextual differences. Methods: The study used multi-site ethnography to investigate the participatory practice of more than 40 artists. Participant observation and extended individual and group dialogues provided data on practice in a diverse range of art forms and settings, analysed using open coding and grounded theory principles. Results: Findings locate differences in practitioners' motivations, and perceptions of the work's function; however, key similarities emerge across both sites, in practitioners' workshop methodologies and crucially in their creative strategies for catalysing change. A model is presented distilling the key elements of a common practice methodology, found across the study and across art forms. Conclusions: The discussion notes where divergences echo nationalities of contributors, drawing inferences about the level of influence of national context in this work, and concludes with the implications of these findings for potential international collaboration, to face challenges within the community arts and health sector globally. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.";Community arts and health | Ethnographic methodology | International comparative research | Mexico | Practice mechanisms;2;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The purpose of the current study was to determine whether or not the theorized components of measured dimensions of suicide risk and psychopathology vary across samples of Italians and immigrants. Methods: We investigated 237 Italians and 234 immigrants, who were administered self-report questionnaires to assess temperament (TEMPS-A), hopelessness (BHS), personality (EPQ-R), and self-other perception (9AP). Results: Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses were conducted, which yielded a final model with an excellent fit to the data (χ (53)2 = 57.56; CFI = 0.994; RMSEA = 0.014). This final model fits significantly better than the previously tested models and indicated that the same pattern of relationships was found between suicide risk and psychopathology across both groups. Conclusions: Although immigrants represent a unique population and may experience specific stressors contributing to psychopathology and suicide risk, our findings suggest that the samples of Italians and immigrants may be more similar on the study variables under investigation than previously thought.

We will recall the classical concept of flexibility (Durand, 2004) and the extent to which it would be pertinent to include non-classical labor. More specifically, we will include a form of flexibilization which has probably become dominant in capitalism since the most recent great economic crisis, outsourcing (Moncada e Monsalvo, 2000) and its connections with non-classical labor. Lastly, we will discuss the thesis of fragmented identities (Sennett e Cobb, 1972) and voluntary servitude (Durand, 2006) in the vein of the approach mentioned in the non-classical article, culminating in considerations on the possibility of training subjects who work under these conditions.;Classical labor | Non-classical labor | Work;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In advanced supply networks like build-to-order supply chains, this task should be carried out under time constraints and under uncertainties both in suppliers and in the orders. The technology of semantic service oriented architectures is aimed to support such tasks, enabling self-organising flexible supply networks (FSN). A novel approach to dynamic network members discovery and selection based on competence profiles included in provided service descriptions is proposed. The approach is based on the idea to characterise all FSN members by their functions or services and to describe them via profiles thus defining their roles. The profiles described by the application ontology are associated with agent-based services that negotiate to take into account explicit and tacit preferences of the enterprises, in order to dynamically configure a network on demand.

The proposed approach divides documents into three parts, which, we hypothesize, correspond to the different stages that a predator employs when approaching a child. Local classifiers are trained for each part of the documents and their outputs are combined by a chain strategy: predictions of a local classifier are used as extra inputs for the next local classifier. Additionally, we propose a ring-based strategy, in which the chaining process is iterated several times, with the goal of further improving the performance of our method. We report experimental results on the corpus used in the first international competition on sexual predator identification (PAN'12). Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms a standard (global) classification technique for the different settings we consider; besides the proposed method compares favorably with most methods evaluated in the PAN'12 competition.";;16;0;;;CONACYT;134186;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We employ a physical pendulum for illustrating his techniques for analysing properties of solutions to differential equations without actually solving them. We next use an elastic pendulum for exhibiting how Poincaré maps allow us to distiguish the periodic from the chaotic solutions, a type of solutions which Poincaré himself discovered while studying the famous three body problem. We also give a heuristic proof of his extraordinary recurrence theorem according to which every bound solution of a conservative dynamical system should return, after a time, Tr, to be as close as we like to its initial conditions.

Research on language distribution has predominantly developed a reductionist approach that shrinks the whole field of science to publications only in a limited number of indexed international journals. English is shown as hegemonic in most disciplines, and virtually monopolistic in natural sciences. Appropriate language policies for the Francophonie and other super-central language areas should however not be based on such reductionist views, but rather consider language use in the broad sociological (Bourdieu) and communicational (Gumperz) field of science and higher education as a whole which comprises three subfields: production (doing research), circulation (reception and distribution of results), and human capital building (teaching). Analysis shows that communication is solidly grounded in French in the subfields of production and teaching, whereas English and sometimes other languages increasingly intrude in circulation, namely in the reading and writing of international scientific literature. This article objects monolingualism of any kind and proposes a plurilingual model of language use in the field of science and education.;English hegemony | Language distribution in science | Plurilingualism;15;0;;;;undefined;

Children with biological risks show great difficulties to begin interactions. When mothers get adjusted to bidirectional relations with neurologically damaged children, an increase in the commencement of interactions by a child is achieved, while fewer responses of the mother to child produce fewer interactions and increases irritability. Early intervention programs which contain in their strategies management of motherinfant interactions have been considered effective for child development. However, further empirical studies are required, concerning the influence of specific patterns of early motherinfant interaction and future development of children with perinatal neurological damage, in terms of prevention of alterations or disability. The present longitudinal study reports the effect of reciprocity of motherinfant interactions in the motor development observed in children of 4, 8, and 12 months old, latent growth curve in structural equation modeling. This model permits the identifications of causal factors that could affect the results in different age groups and provides predictions of the relations in a more complex form than lineal relations. Based on the model designed, it could be shown that motherinfant interactions of reciprocity best characterized children with higher development level while the absence is seen in children with retarded development. We classified mothers and children in two types, respectively: interactive and organized mothers vs. noninteractive and disorganized ones; interactive and responsive children vs. non-interactive and non-responsive ones. Subjecting these two types of mothers and children to four possible combinations, the model results showed different motor development predictions in the children. On one hand, we estimated regression coefficient of four dyadic systems, obtained by combinations of different types of mothers and children: interactive and organized mother with interactive and responsive child (Dyadic system 1); interactive and organized mother with non-interactive and non-responsive child (Dyadic system 2); non-interactive and disorganized mother with interactive and responsive child (Dyadic system 3); and non-interactive and disorganized mother with non-interactive and non-responsive child (Dyadic system 4). Dyadic system 1 was associated with a better motor development in children with a mayor regression coefficient (19.82), followed by System 2 and System 3 (regression coefficient of 17.54 and 11.46, respectively). System 4 had a negative estimate value of regression coefficient (-11.27) in our model. On the other hand, we estimated intercept values according to the interactive type of these mothers and children. Among the four interactive types, solely two of them had statistically significant intercepts (p < .05), β0 = 66.13 for interactive children and β0 = 42.76, for non-interactive children. To predict the motor development of 4, 8, and 12 months old children, the slope with attenuation permitted to give a mayor model fitting, with the regression coefficient of 0, 1 and 1.5, respectively. This model presented excellent values of model fitting indicators (x2 = .96, p = .97, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = .00). This line of study should be widened, because motor development is the principal domain consolidated in the first months of life. It is fundamental in domain organizations of higher complexity as cognition and language. We conclude that this model showed that in high risk perinatal children, early mother-child interactions represent a good predictor of motor development in the first year of life. Moreover, we found that motor achievements in the first months of life can be a strong predictive indicator of future development of a child. These findings suggest the importance in clinical practice of observation and registration of mother-child interactions as part of an integral strategy of child evaluation.";Dyadic system | Latent growth curve modeling | Mother-infant interaction | Motor development prediction | Perinatal neurological damage | Prevention disability;2;0;;;;undefined;

In this context, strategies and means focus on sustainable resource use and often emphasize community-based and/or nature-based tourism. While broader socio-cultural shifts in western societies and market trends related to them are promising, there is still little evidence that tourism effectively supports biodiversity conservation, local development, and cultural self-determination in the long-term.To address these issues, this chapter presents a case study that sheds light on the complex socio-political transformations triggered by fast-paced tourism development in La Ventanilla, an increasingly popular destination on Mexico's Pacific coast. In order to study the community-based tourism development, the authors apply an actor-oriented analysis, that takes local population, government institutions, NGOs, multilateral institutions, and businesses into account.The chapter concludes that despite genuine attempts to enhance community-based tourism development, the aims originally established have not been achieved, as many projects conceived to promote nature-based tourism have altered conditions of local development in La Ventanilla; such as social cohesion, a sense of community, and mutual trust. Well-intentioned interventions by non-place-based actors have exacerbated socio-economic disparities and compromised the potential for future sustainable tourism-driven development. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Simulation frameworks based on coordination models - that is, explicitly handling interaction - suit well the complex system simulation: and those based on nature-inspired coordination models, in particular, are well-suited for the simulation of complex natural systems. In this paper, we adopt an approach to self-organising coordination based on biochemical tuple spaces for self-organising coordination, and show how it can be applied to the simulation of complex interaction patterns of intracellular signalling pathways. We first present the model and a general high-level architecture, then we develop and discuss a simple case study - a single signalling pathway from the complex network of the Ras signalling pathways. © 2013 Operational Research Society Ltd.

However, there are no studies about the possible effects of rotenone on the offspring when they are indirectly exposed through their mothers. In this study rotenone was administered to female rats during pregnancy and nursing, in order to assess its effects on the offspring's dopaminergic neurons as well as on motor coordination at 30 or 60 postnatal days. In order to quantify the neurons that are immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxilase of the substantia nigra six groups of pregnant Wistar rats were injected: intact (control), with rotenone solvent (vehicle), and four groups injected with the following doses of rotenone: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 y 1.0 mg/kg/day. In a parallel experiment, the offspring of other groups of dams treated with rotenone 1 mg/kg/day, or controls were evaluated at the motor coordination test at 30 and 60 postnatal days. Rotenone treated (1 mg/kg) dams showed a lower amount of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This effect was also noticed in the offspring but at all doses of rotenone used, either at 30 or 60 postnatal days. Furthermore, the offspring of rotenone indirectly exposed dams significantly increased the time in which they accomplished the motor coordination test. These data indicate that rotenone is able to damage the dopaminergic neurons of the offspring when exposed through their mothers. This effect in the offspring is noticed with lower rotenone doses than in adult rats. Therefore, those individuals indirectly exposed to rotenone could have less dopaminergic neurons at early stages of life, a fact that increases the risk of developing disorders related to the brains' dopaminergic system.;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder | Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder | Motor coordination | Parkinson's disease | Rotenone | Substantia nigra | Tyrosine hydroxilase;4;0;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

We conducted a qualitative study that included interviews with nine key actors, participant observation at relevant events, and a review of relevant documents specific to the field. The data collected indicate that the sexological field in Mexico participates intensely in processes and discourses in a dynamic that follows global strategies. The article covers several decades and reviews contextual factors involved in the configuration of Mexican sexology. The information presented here allows us to think about the relationship between local and global processes in the sexological field. Characterizing and analyzing this relationship is fundamental to understanding specific mechanisms, which have permitted sexology to legitimate itself as a discourse of truth on sex. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;history of sexology | qualitative studies | Sexology in Mexico;3;0;;;;undefined;

Textbooks function in a foreign language classroom in many capacities (Cunningsworth 1995), one of which is the provision of text, used as a model for language practice, including practice of pronunciation. The changing methodological trends in EFL pedagogy over the decades affect EFL textbook pronunciation treatment in a variety of ways. In this paper a simple feasibility study is presented whereby a few beginners' textbooks are compared with respect to their handling of pronunciation in the first unit of the course. Four textbooks come from about 1/2 century ago, and three are sampled from among those currently available. On the descriptive level, some analysis is offered of the phonetic (and especially phonolapsological) characteristics of the sampled texts, as they changed through time. On the level of application, it is claimed that, while the lexico-grammatical and pedagogical limitations on the content of the first lessons/units in EFL textbooks leave authors little space for phonetic control, a modicum of such control is feasible if attention is paid to such variables as pronunciation difficulty and L1 transfer. The Phonetic Difficulty Index (PDI), which is briefly introduced in the paper, can be used to measure and control some of these variables and give the textbook authors and users a useful teaching/learning instrument.;;4;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

It synthesizes specific conceptions of nature, as well as cumulative learning, beliefs and customs that are part of a particular human community or society. Traditional knowledge has been analyzed from different viewpoints, one of which corresponds to the analysis of ethnoclassifications. In this work, a brief analysis of the botanical traditional knowledge among Zapotecs of the municipality of San Agustin Loxicha, Oaxaca was conducted. The purposes of this study were: a) to analyze the traditional ecological knowledge of local plant resources through the folk classification of both landscapes and plants and b) to determine the role that this knowledge has played in plant resource management and conservation. The study was developed in five communities of San Agustín Loxicha. From field trips, plant specimens were collected and showed to local people in order to get the Spanish or Zapotec names; through interviews with local people, we obtained names and identified classification categories of plants, vegetation units, and soil types. We found a logic structure in Zapotec plant names, based on linguistic terms, as well as morphological and ecological caracteristics. We followed the classification principles proposed by Berlin [6] in order to build a hierarchical structure of life forms, names and other characteristics mentioned by people. We recorded 757 plant names. Most of them (67%) have an equivalent Zapotec name and the remaining 33% had mixed names with Zapotec and Spanish terms. Plants were categorized as native plants, plants introduced in pre-Hispanic times, or plants introduced later. All of them are grouped in a hierarchical classification, which include life form, generic, specific, and varietal categories. Monotypic and polytypic names are used to further classify plants. This holistic classification system plays an important role for local people in many aspects: it helps to organize and make sense of the diversity, to understand the interrelation among plants-soil-vegetation and to classify their physical space since they relate plants with a particular vegetation unit and a kind of soil. The locals also make a rational use of these elements, because they know which crops can grow in any vegetation unit, or which places are indicated to recollect plants. These aspects are interconnected and could be fundamental for a rational use and management of plant resources. © 2012 Luna-José and Aguilar; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";Ethnobotany | Ethnoclassification | San Agustín Loxicha | Traditional ecological knowledge | Zapotecs;9;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We describe the Y-chromosome genetic diversity of 197 Native Mexicans from 11 populations and 1,044 individuals from 44 Native American populations after combining with publicly available data. We found extensive heterogeneity among Native Mexican populations and ample segregation of Q-M242* (46%) and Q-M3 (54%) haplogroups within Mexico. The northernmost sampled populations falling outside Mesoamerica (Pima and Tarahumara) showed a clear differentiation with respect to the other populations, which is in agreement with previous results from mtDNA lineages. However, our results point toward a complex genetic makeup of Native Mexicans whose maternal and paternal lineages reveal different narratives of their population history, with sex-biased continental contributions and different admixture proportions. At a continental scale, we found that Arctic populations and the northernmost groups from North America cluster together, but we did not find a clear differentiation within Mesoamerica and the rest of the continent, which coupled with the fact that the majority of individuals from Central and South American samples are restricted to the Q-M3 branch, supports the notion that most Native Americans from Mesoamerica southwards are descendants from a single wave of migration. This observation is compatible with the idea that present day Mexico might have constituted an area of transition in the diversification of paternal lineages during the colonization of the Americas.

Particular emphasis is placed on interactions between the medical field, public authorities and associative space, the latter being understood as the place where individual and collective actors compete to define the cause. The authors argue that the major phases in the structuring of the struggle, the pace of state intervention and the creation of a multi-organizational field, can only be understood if one adopts a 'configurational perspective' attentive to the manner in which, in a given context and under the effect of particular constraints, key actors strategically interact and contribute to transforming their environment and their chances of reaching their goals. This approach takes into account the changing socio-biological characteristics of those who have committed themselves to the cause. In turn, internal movement divisions about how to respond to the epidemic as well as the changing perceptions of the disease have modified the opportunities for commitment, encouraging certain individual kinds of people and excluding others. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;activism | AIDS | social movements | Switzerland | volunteers;5;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The paper shows that CPPs can promote better policy design and implementation of public policy by benefiting from the strengths of both nonprofits and government. The paper answers pending questions like, 'in which contexts are CPPs effective?', 'what characteristics of nonprofits improve policy implementation?'; 'how does the reputation and public trust that local nonprofits enjoy transfer to the partnership?' and 'to what extent does non-profit participation create more citizens engagement?', among others. By answering these questions the paper shows the potential benefits that local government-nonprofits partnerships can bring to the policymaking process, but it also argues that effective CPPs are fraught with challenges. The paper demonstrates the need for more inclusive and identity-sensitive local governance mechanisms, and for institutional arrangements that anticipate conflict and address increasing inequalities and community disengagement. The paper shows that effective governance is a collaborative venture in which social inputs need to be taken into account in program design; and a shared vision of the common good needs to be built-up for policy implementation.By exposing the tensions and conflicts of this governance experiment, the paper draws lessons for nonprofits, governments, and policymakers who seek to participate or design collaborative ventures.The case studied is the program of Pueblos Magicos in Valle de Bravo, Mexico, an instructive object of study, which lessons are not unique to this small town in central Mexico, but common to towns experiencing rapid demographic and economic growth elsewhere.";citizen's participation | civic engagement | government-nonprofit partnerships | local development | policy implementation | social inputs;1;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

However, there is an irrefutable fact that is jeopardizing capitalism and its chimerical claims of sustained economic growth: the planet has biophysical limits. Twenty-first-century socialism, therefore, cannot rely on the dynamics of economic growth. It rather has to build a world economy that not only frees workers from exploitation, but releases nature from irrational exploitation as well. In fact, for socialist countries to withdraw from growth represents the paramount environmental challenge to be overcome. This means moving from ostentatious consumption towards a new principle of moderation.

She argues that in every process of communication, whether face to face or through the media, fashion, and political propaganda, there is always an excess beyond the informative and functional value of a message. This excess is the aesthetic. Following Huizinga’s view of play as an ingredient of any social environment, Mandoki explores how various cultural practices are in fact forms of playing since, for the author, aesthetics and play are Siamese twins. One of the unique contributions of this BOOK is the elaboration and application of a semiotic model for the simultaneous analysis of social interactions in the four registers, namely visual, auditory, verbal and body language, to detect the aesthetic strategies deployed in specific situations. She argues that since the presentation of the self is targeted towards participants’ sensibilities, aesthetics plays a key role in these modes of exchange.

Lejeune judged that Mexico had actually carried out two revolutions under Díaz: a political one that produced social peace; and an economic one based on railroad construction, which had made mining and other industries more Prof.table than ever before. Now Lejeune felt that the nation needed a third revolution, one that would overhaul its hydrological regime and bring wealth and development to the countryside. The problem, from his perspective, was not the lack of water but rather the absence of a sophisticated irrigation system. The construction of such a system, he believed, had the potential to generate even greater Prof.ts than industry or mining.1 Other experts agreed. As one observer put it in 1906, ""the true difficulty-we could even say the only difficulty-is the shortage of irrigation."" No one doubted that only a tiny proportion of Mexico's vast territory of nearly two million square kilometers was used as cropland. Raoul Bigot wrote in 1907 that farmers cultivated a mere 6.1 percent of Mexico's total surface; 87 percent of these croplands (5.3 percent of the national territory) consisted of rain-fed (temporal) fields, meaning that a mere 13 percent of cropland (1.55 million hectares, or 0.6 percent of the surface of Mexico) was irrigated. He further estimated that pastures of one sort or another accounted for a quarter of the nation's surface area and forests for another 9 percent, leaving him to conclude that the remaining 60.4 percent of Mexico was unused altogether.3 These figures do not seem unreasonable when we consider that studies conducted as late as 1921 concurred that only 6 percent of the land in Mexico was used for agriculture.4 Not all of this unproductive terrain was suitable for farming, of course, but most experts agreed that up to 40 percent of the national territory had some potential use if the agricultural frontier could somehow be extended. They emphasized the potential benefits of irrigation and the application of modern agricultural technology on medium-sized and large properties. Andrés Molina Enríquez, one of the most passionate critics of the Porfirian regime, considered the issue of irrigation so critical that he named it one of the five grandes problemas (along with credit, population, politics, and the unequal distribution of property) that confronted the nation in 1909. The state of Morelos had become the nation's primary sugar producer by the time Molina Enríquez made these observations. Indeed, Morelos plantations held some of the most productive sugar lands in the world even though they lay just a short distance southwest of Mexico City's far cooler climate. Yet the state's continued development depended on landowners' ability to expand irrigation networks and, crucially, to gain access to enough water for their thirsty crops. Three idiosyncratic features of the state's geography made this hydrological puzzle all the more complicated. In the first place, the state had an enviable abundance of water, for two major watersheds lay within its border: most of the state, including the Valley of Cuernavaca, lay within the Cuautla/Amilpas watershed, which itself forms part of the larger Balsas River basin; a far smaller proportion lay within the Nexapa River basin on the eastern border of the state of Puebla. Second, Morelos had some of the most intensively irrigated land in the country by the eve of the 1910 revolution because sugar planters had built numerous irrigation projects to take advantage of all this water.6 Finally, landowners' monopolization of the state's abundant water resources helped to make Morelos a focal point of the revolutionary upheaval. In this chapter, I suggest that access to water-and the management of water resources in particular-constituted the primary challenge for the continued growth of Morelos sugar haciendas. This hypothesis is not new, yet it merits reconsideration because historians appear to have lost sight of the fundamental role water played in the state's environmental and social history. While a generation of observers during the Porfirian and revolutionary eras had suggested that social conflict over water limited the possibilities for agricultural growth and helped to spark the Zapatista revolt in 1910,7 subsequent analysts rejected this ""hydraulic thesis"" and suggested that access to land was the key bottleneck to increased sugar production and therefore lay at the core of the state's agrarian problem.8 Most historians have adopted what amounts to a simplified version of Domingo Diez's argument that sugar planters' adoption of centrifuges around 1880 increased the efficiency of the refining process and touched off a ""radical change"" to social relations because it led sugar planters to seek new land to put into production, which inevitably came at the expense of peasant communities: "" The pueblos [peasant communities],"" Diez wrote in 1918, ""were obliged to yield their land and water,"" and villagers' communal property ""gradually diminished, in some cases disappearing altogether."" This ""social imbalance"" intensified until the revolution broke out in 1910. Historians have tended to seize on the agrarian component of Diez's observations. Their explanations for revolutionary upheaval in Morelos routinely subordinate the issue of water to the supposedly more important question of land. After all, that analytic simplification squared with the Zapatistas' revolutionary slogan, ""Land and Liberty!"" Yet there can be no doubt water was a crucial source of wealth disparities and social tension. For example, the Ministry of Development assessed a hectare of irrigated land in Morelos at 877 pesos on the eve of the revolution, whereas rain-fed land was assessed at a mere 100 pesos.10 Moreover, cadastral figures show that sugar haciendas planted only cane on the small proportion of their property that could be irrigated.11Water, not land, therefore represented the fundamental bottleneck to sugar production; as landowner Manuel Araoz observed as early as 1914, sugar haciendas occupied 60 percent of all land in the state, yet only 15 percent of the state's territory was irrigated. We must reconsider the hydraulic thesis if we hope to understand the challenges that sugar planters (and, indirectly, the pueblos) confronted in Morelos. While it might be an overstatement to say that water was the source of the Zapatista uprising, a comprehensive view of the Morelos countryside on the eve of the revolution must include an analysis of both land and water.";;5;0;;;;undefined;

Method: Data are reported from emergency department studies in 14 countries on the prevalence of patients' self-report of drinking within the 6 hours before the violence-related injury event, patients' belief that the event would not have happened if they had not been drinking at the time, and patients' perception that the perpetrator had been drinking. Alcohol-attributable fraction was calculated based on the patients' perception that their own drinking was causally related to the event and on their perception that the perpetrator had been drinking. Results: Across all countries, 62.9% of the violence-related injuries involved alcohol use on the part of the victim, the perpetrator, or both. Rates of others definitely drinking, as perceived by the victim, ranged from 14% to 73% across countries and was positively associated with patients' own drinking in the event and with attributing a causal association between their drinking and the event. Estimates of alcohol-attributable fraction were 38.8% when the victim and perpetrator were considered together compared with 23.9% when only the patient was considered and varied by country-level drinking pattern. Conclusions: These findings suggest adjustments that could be made to global burden of disease estimates because of violence-related injury morbidity to better reflect alcohol-attributable fraction when drinking by others and country-level drinking patterns are taken into account.

The basic idea is that, rather than being an all-or-none concept as in classic economic theories, market efficiency changes over time and over time horizons. Within this framework, market efficiency is measured in terms of the patterns contained in the price changes sequence relative to the patterns in a random sequence. In line with evolutionary finance ideas, the empirical results for the Dow Jones Index showed that the degree of market efficiency varies over time and is dependent of the time scale. In general, the DJI is more efficient for shorter (about days) than for longer (about months and quarters) time scales. On the other hand, the market efficiency exhibits a cyclic behavior with two dominant periods of about 4.5 and 22. years. It is apparent that the 4.5-year cycle is related to inventory (Kitchin-type) effects, while the 22-year cycle to structure inversion (Kondriatev-type) cycles. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;Cycle | Dow Jones Index | Entropy | Market efficiency;36;0;;;;undefined;

This paper reports a survey of the academic qualifications and duties of 185 ELT staff in seven Mexican public universities and relates these to the Mexican government's standards for university lecturers in general (Programa para el Mejoramiento del Profesorado [PROMEP]). It was found that the proportion of ELT staff officially accredited with a desirable PROMEP profile was low, and that other staff varied from the PROMEP profile in different ways and to different degrees. Possible reasons for the wide variation in the position of ELT staff in tertiary institutions are explored and discussed in this paper, and suggestions are made for follow-up studies. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Foreign language teaching methodology/teacher education | Language policy/planning | Second language acquisition;0;0;;;;undefined;

The authors used a qualitative methodology and applied semi-structured interviews to this program's staff, university authorities and student representatives, and they organized focal groups with students. The participation was proposed following the participation level model of Chávez (2003): information, consultation, decision, control and management. This program's infrastructure, diffusion and structure, the coordination between the campus' departments, the administrative and legislative structure of the university and the students' academic activities were very relevant for the participation. The students take part in the informative and consultative levels. For the decision, control and management levels, the students tend to participate through the student representatives, although this one is not present in environmental programs.;Environmental education | Responsibility | Social influence | Students' participation | Universities knowledge;3;0;;;;undefined;

As we will show, years of misguided economic policies at the national level have been at the heart of the Mexican crisis. On the one hand, the dominance of foreign banks in the country's financial system and the minimal presence of the public banks have greatly limited the range of counter-cyclical policy options available to authorities. On the other hand, in the face of the crisis, Mexico has continuously applied deflationary Washington Consensus policies that have deepened the economic contraction. This article will focus on Mexico's individual problems, which offer important lessons for other Latin American countries with a shared recent history of Washington Consensus policies. © 2011 The Authors.

Hawtrey's main contributions to the theory of the lender of last resort (LLR), both national and international (ILLR). This theory is a continuation of one of the traditions of the classical period, started by Henry Thornton, which differs in important points from that of Walter Bagehot. In their treatment of the classical concepts the authors partly depart from the interpretation of Thomas M. Humphrey, who considers that Thornton and Bagehot have basically the same approach about LLR. Hawtrey renewed Thonton's views and extended the concepts to new problems, including the ILLR. Hawtrey built a model of LLR in a dynamic macroeconomic model that includes the Cambridge market for cash balance and introduces the bases of a theory of ILLR, describing the sequence of twin crisis, exchange and banking crisis, thus explaining the difficulties for an ILLR to act on the currency market without taking the risks involved, in a situation completely different to the one faced on the money market by the national LLR. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.;Central bank | Credit | Hawtrey | International lender of last resort | Lender of last resort | Twin crisis;8;0;;;;undefined;

With this incongruence as its starting point, the paper offers a critique both of the epistemological factors underlying the category of 'men who have sex with men' and the logic running through HIV prevention discourses that adhere to the Foucauldian notion of the deployment of sexuality, which demands both truth and coherence in subjects' sexuality. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.;HIV prevention | Homosexuality | Masculinity | Mexico | Migrant;4;0;;;UC Berkeley;undefined;University of California Berkeley

The evolutionary context of Deng Xiaoping's development strategy is described and the causes for the erosion of the Soviet model and the failure of Perestroika are analyzed. A reflection of the class character of the Chinese model follows. Finally, the essay discusses the conditions under which the Chinese way to socialism might become a general transition model for twenty-first-century socialism.;China model | class character of Chinese model | mode of production | Perestroika | superstructure | transition model | twenty-first-century socialism;0;0;;;;undefined;

Kant (1987) was the first author who situated this category at the center of his aesthetic theory in his Critique of Judgment (1987). He related such a category to its cognitive powers, although he did not think they were related to truth’s validity. The aesthetic produced its own validity. Kant’s concept of imagination gave account of the active operations which take place in the free play of understanding and sensibility. The concept of imagination differed from past versions because Kant did not regard it as a passive operation-a mimetic imagination-but as an active, productive imagination. With Kant’s concept of imagination the category ceased to be conceptualized as a mirror projecting reflections of some external reality. Instead, imagination was seen as central to all knowledge and as a creative capacity. This kind of knowledge, Kant thought, was neither entirely subjective nor objective. It was a shared knowledge and the result of common sense (sensus communis).122 The following development of this category taken by Hannah Arendt (1982) only enhanced Kant’s original intuitions. As Mary Warnock claims “the mystery of how on earth we communicate with each other has been solved. For the world as it appears is genuinely common to us all, though grasped and understood by each�? (1994: 14). We humans share the identical cognitive faculties of imagination and understanding projected on our capacity to communicate our judgments and on sharing our common sense (intersubjectivity). Thanks to the relevance of Arendt’s intervention in rescuing Kant’s original contribution to the concept of imagination, we now think about this concept as involving a Copernican revolution.123 How did this revolution happen? It took some time-I wish to argue-to configure the new scenario where such a concept would play a significant role in providing the tools for the feminist revolution. To trace back some of the important historical developments that led to this conceptual transformation will be the subject of this chapter.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

This review covers the research published within the last 20 years on the experience of people of Hispanic background regarding suicide ideation and attempt when they first come to the US (first generation) looking for improvements in their standard of living through better jobs and more social opportunities, and as immigrants get settled and have US-Born children (second generation) and grand-children (third generation and so on). We also introduce new research regarding suicide ideation and attempt among return migrants and the families that the immigrants leave behind in their homeland. The current research in this area is limited in number and scope of interest, with most studies focusing on the simple ethnicity comparison. The research is basically cross-sectional and has produced results that are inconsistent in several key points. Currently, we do not know if Hispanics have rates of suicide ideation and attempts that are higher (or lower) when compared to Whites in the US. Evidence is more consistent on four other points. First, there is evidence that immigrants of Mexican origin who immigrated while youths (12 years or less) have rates of suicide ideation and attempt that are higher than similar persons who remained in their home country (i.e. Mexican non-migrants). Second, immigrants have crude lower prevalence of suicide ideation and attempt (both lifetime and 12-month) when compared to US-Born Hispanics of the same ethnicity, especially if they immigrated at older ages. Third, there is some evidence that Hispanics with more US-Born parents to have higher crude prevalence of suicide attempt when compared to US-Born Hispanics with no US-Born parents, but this was not always supported in multivariate analyses. Fourth, all studies showed that the preference in the use of English was positively associated with ideation, and suicide attempt, but associations between language use and attempts did not reach statistical significance. Research efforts that combine populations and information from sending and receiving countries and expand the number of groups under comparison to cover as many specific migratory experiences as possible are needed. This effort will require much more complex research designs that will call for true international collaboration. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

As long as the dynamics of the law suppose all the participants' freedom (the actions could be imputed to them) its sense is constituted by the conditions that allow such freedom.

Thanks to Alburquerque and Carrizo Rueda researches, among others, this situation has radically changed in the Hispanic world. From their definitions of travel accounts, that allow selecting texts by narratological, rhetoric and cultural criteria, not only focusing on the subject, as traditionally was done, this work explores the genre development in Latin American literature since Independence with the purpose of explaining its chronological development. It also tries to describe the different formal patterns in which the genre has been practiced, all of which has also suffered its own evolution. The suggested typology is formed by models that can be extrapolated to other literatures.;Chronology | Latin American Literature | Poetics | Travel accounts | Typology;6;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Materials and methods: A quasi-experimental study with crossover design and simple masking was conducted in 24 randomized subjects to initiate the control or experimental group. Traction and rhythmic oscillation were applied for five minutes to the ankle joint. H wave amplitude changes of Hoffmann reflex (electrical equivalent of the monosynaptic spinal reflex) was assessed, stimulating the tibial nerve at the level of the popliteal fossa and recording in the soleus muscle. In each subject 12 measurements were taken: basal rate, during and after mobilization. Changes in H reflex amplitude were calculated in relation to basal measurement.For each measurement a hypothesis test was performed (Student t test). Results: In groups of patients with brain injury and incomplete spinal cord injury, a significant difference was found between measurements of both studies, concerning variation in H reflex amplitude during the application of joint mobilization techniques, with a decrease in the experimental group and an increase in the control group. In contrast, no significant differences were found after mobilization therapy. Patients with complete spinal cord injury showed no significant differences in any measurements. Conclusion: We demonstrate the effectiveness of joint mobilization in the decrease of H reflex amplitude in patients with brain injury or incomplete spinal cord injury during the mobilization maneuver, but no residual effect after completion of the trial. This research showed no evidence regarding excitability reduction in complete spinal cord injury. We suggest that therapeutic interventions to decrease muscle tone based on the joint mobilization should be reconsidered.;Exercise movement techniques | Muscle spasticity | Muscle tone | Musculoskeletal manipulations;1;0;;;;undefined;

As some of the findings are robust to changes in the econometric methodology used, the article reaches the following conclusions. First, manufacturing exports are positively related to labor productivity and external demand; so the adverse effects of an international recession on Mexican exports could, to some extent, be offset by raising worker productivity. Second, real exchange-rate depreciation does not increase manufacturing exports, but actually reduces them, at least in the short run. These findings are consistent with the idea that a real depreciation not only affects demand, but also generates strong supply-side effects.";Econometric models | Economic policy | Exports | Labour productivity | Manufactures | Mexico;2;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

As such, there are many manifestations of injustice to analyze. In this chapter, I want to examine the injustice through another, distinct, angle. I have chosen to refl ect on how the I that does not suff er behaves before the other that suff ers. The time frame I am analyzing includes the months of January, March, April, and July of 2004. The event is the recovery of fragments of historical memory from news reports regarding the victims' families' struggle for justice and how their demands were met with reprimands by the groups in power. The question I am posing is this: How does the hegemonic group of Juarez regard itself in the face of the victims' families' pain? I recognize the particular infl uence that Tzvetan Todorov's Abuses of Memory and Conquest of America: The Question of the Other have had on my analysis; his story serves as a model for my own. My objective in this recovery of memory is not to lose the moral sense of the supposed acts of solidarity or of the pleas for justice which groups in power have made on behalf of victims' families.1 Rather, I argue that we must be mindful that these groups are composed of men and women who occupy positions of privilege due to their gender and class status. To not recover this memory is to set aside critical and refl ective consciousness- This applies to both those related to the victims and those who are not. Devoid of this recovery, Ivone Gebara states, we avoid understanding the events' disillusionments, self-deceptions, betrayals, and ambiguities, and we are hindered from clear-headedly maturing into new forms of action from an ethical and feminist antiviolence politics. We must become aware of the errors, ailments, mistakes, complicities, and concrete violent acts which tangible men and women have performed in this violent state of aff airs.2 Only in this way ""can we overcome the simplistic and dualistic standpoints that separate the guilty from the innocent.""3 Accordingly, each person will be able to assume the responsibility that corresponds to her or him. From our feminist stance, we women need to be aware of all the agreements and understandings that exist between the perpetrating parties. Above all, we need to be aware of how political groups and groups in power have appropriated these events and how the interests for which we have struggled have been substituted or reversed in favor of others' interests or against our own. Th at is why I seek to assess the manner in which people in power evaluate subordinate groups and portray them through their particular class perspective, especially when these subordinate groups are affl icted with pain and injustice. I believe that those who have felt excruciating pain in the fl esh are the relatives of the women who have been murdered. Furthermore, components of the structure of violence combine within them: The voices that are not heard; the lack of money; the lack of power, which excludes them. In this sense, practices are adjusted and selected depending on the person's social position, and this gives her or him a certain social orientation or sense of place from which to articulate experience and produce classifi able acts, which are also acts of classifi cation and which are themselves classifi ed.4 I situate my analysis from this position and vis- A-vis the paradigms of patriarchal and capitalist hegemony, utilizing the Gramscian concepts of coercion and consensus. Th is perspective will shed light on the groups in power that approach the pain of the victims' families. The Gramscian concept of hegemony describes a double process wherein one social group's supremacy is obtained not only by physical force-what he calls domination and control- but also by the dominated people's consensual submission by way of the leadership or direction of people apparently unlinked to the state.5 Pierre Bourdieu argues that, even when domination is founded on the crudest of force, it always possesses a symbolic component. In symbolic violence, the acts of submission and obedience are present, and they are exerted by the support that the dominated cannot cease to grant to the dominant and the domination in general. The dominated does this because, when interacting with the dominator, she or he has no other way to do this but in the way that such interaction has been structured: This structure of power relations becomes an instrument for advancing hegemonic schemes that come to seem natural, such as the divisions between light skinned/dark skinned, rich/poor, knowledgeable/ignorant, male/female, victim/savior, good/bad, authentic/false, original/copy, orthodox/heretic, and so on. Such categorizations order and maintain social structures and perceptions, and they ultimately come to be defi ned by structures of inequitable capital.6 Both groups perceive themselves within such categories: family members see themselves as the excluded group, as the other; hegemonic groups view themselves as the distinguished (the eminent), as the I. Both groups are divided into these social classes. The comments made by privileged groups in 2004 richly display the social production around the murders and reveal the marked diff erence between distinct social classes. From these two indicators, I have been able to confi rm how symbolic power constructs reality and how it establishes a set of beliefs that become legitimate knowledge. In the news stories that I analyze, we can discern three Marxist symbolic functions: (a) the dominant class group that affi rms communication between its members and distinguishes them from other social classes; (b) the dominant class's feigned and conventional interpretation of the whole society; and (c) the legitimization of order established through hierarchies and distinctions and the endorsement of these distinctions through ""titles of nobility"" given to those who declare their worry, empathy, and feigned sorrow.7 Th is poses consequences for the attainment of justice, for socially dominant bodies stubbornly produce generalized value judgments. At the same time, dominant culture serves to establish subtle diff erences in the perception of otherness and confers on social agents a certainty in the ""we,"" which serves as a lens through which to interpret reality and impede the victims' and their families' access to justice.8.

One way to achieve innovation is through artifacts that allow the development of successful information systems in organizations. Moreover, the field of health appears as a sector with many opportunities to improve services through IT and design. Therefore, e-health comes out as one of the elements that should eventually help in the evolution of business models in health systems. In this chapter, the authors present a design method of IT artifacts for e-health adapted from the method proposed by Pahl and Beitz (1995). The correctness of the design method adopted is a significant issue to generate new business models successfully or to adapt the existing ones in health systems. © 2011, IGI Global.;;1;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

In this view, the written law is the most important factor to legal outcomes. In the anti-formalist versions of legal positivism, courts are able to exercise judgment and discretion; they are not seriously constrained by written law, hence, judges are the most powerful factor. In both these views however, the role of lawyers and strategies is relatively unimportant. Contrary to this perspective is the work of LoPucki and Weyrauch which asserts that it is the strategic view of the legal process that captures its reality. LoPucki and Weyrauch claim that the evidence supports the view that lawyers are able to overcome both law and judicial discretion and determine legal outcomes. Under this perspective, the legal process itself is not just a matter of formal legal rules. Rather, the legal process is concerned with the strategic use of legal rules and principles. In this chapter, the authors challenge this perspective and identify that significant differences arise under their proposed alternative approach which takes relevant social processes into consideration. This chapter identifies some of the difficulties inherent in comparing the existing methodologies or approaches to legal strategy and defends an approach based on interpretations and strategic coordination of legal resources. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.";;0;0;;;;undefined;

Nowadays the qualitative characteristics analysis is manually done by using visual perception (inspecting spectrograms) and by auditory perception (listening cry recordings). This perceptive analysis is the one expert physicians apply to help them make a diagnosis. In this work we present a method based in the definition of a threshold applied to the energy of the signal, this threshold allows to identify automatically cry units in a sample recording and another threshold that allows eliminating inspiratory cry segments. We also present a method that allows automatically identifying the melodic shape, shifts, glides and noise concentrations in cry units.

The associations between physical conditions and suicidal behavior remain unclear due to sparse data and varied methodology. Methods: Predictive associations between 13 temporally prior physical conditions and first onset of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were examined in a 14-country sample (n = 37,915) after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and psychosocial covariates, with and without adjustment for mental disorders. Results: Most physical conditions were associated with suicidal ideation in the total sample; high blood pressure, heart attack/stroke, arthritis, chronic headache, other chronic pain, and respiratory conditions were associated with attempts in the total sample; epilepsy, cancer, and heart attack/stroke were associated with planned attempts. Epilepsy was the physical condition most strongly associated with the suicidal outcomes. Physical conditions were especially predictive of suicidality if they occurred early in life. As the number of physical conditions increased, the risk of suicidal outcomes also increased, however the added risk conferred was generally smaller with each additional condition. Adjustment for mental disorders made little substantive difference to these results. Physical conditions were equally predictive of suicidality in higher and lower income countries. Conclusions: The presence of physical conditions is a risk factor for suicidal behavior even in the absence of mental disorder. © 2010 by the American Psychosomatic Society.";mental disorders | physical conditions | suicidal behavior;151;0;;;NIH;R01MH069864;National Institutes of Health

The thermal flows correspond to natural and mixed convection. The results are obtained based on a fixed point iterative process for solving the nonlinear elliptic system that results after an appropriate time discretization is made. The iterative process leads to the solution of uncoupled, well conditioned linear elliptic problems for which very efficient solvers are known to exist regardless of the space discretization.;Dicretization | Isothermal flow | Natural convection | Velocity-vorticity | Viscous fluids;4;0;;;;undefined;

In this article we present one such problem. We demonstrate a close relationship between the golden mean and a special case of Newton's aerodynamical problem for the frustum of a cone. Then, we exhibit a parallel relationship between the general case of this problem and a family of means called POEM's (for pth Order Extreme Means). This shows that the POEM's not only share with the golden mean the algebraic and geometric properties established by Falbo, but also a remarkable minimizing physical property. Sadly, we have another situation in which an interesting property of the golden mean is matched by those of the POEM's. © THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA.";;3;0;;;;undefined;

In this form, producers and consumers rely on demand and price forecasts to decide their bidding strategies, allocate assets, negotiate bilateral contracts, hedge risks, and plan facility investments. A basic feature of efficient market hypothesis is the absence of correlations between price increments over any time scale leading to random walk-type behavior of prices, so arbitrage is not possible. However, recent studies have suggested that this is not the case and correlations are present in the behavior of diverse electricity markets. In this paper, a temporal quantification of electricity market correlations is made by means of detrended fluctuation and Allan analyses. The approach is applied to two Canadian electricity markets, Ontario and Alberta. The results show the existence of correlations in both demand and prices, exhibiting complex time-dependent behavior with lower correlations in winter while higher in summer. Relatively steady annual cycles in demand but unstable cycles in prices are detected. On the other hand, the more significant nonlinear effects (measured in terms of a multifractality index) are found for winter months, while the converse behavior is displayed during the summer period. In terms of forecasting models, our results suggest that nonlinear recursive models (e.g., feedback NNs) should be used for accurate day-ahead price estimation. In contrast, linear models can suffice for demand forecasting purposes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;Correlations | Electricity markets | Hurst exponent dynamics;37;0;;;;undefined;

Asia poses serious challenges and opportunities for Latin America that differ depending on the resource endowment and the productive structure of each subregion. In the case of South America, the wide variety of natural resources it possesses and the nature of its productive structure, concentrated on the production of goods based on natural resources, has rendered the relationship with the Asian countries as mainly complementary, turning the Southern Cone into an important provider of these goods for Asia, especially to China, and an attracting pole to investment projects that tend to exploit these resources. In the case of Mexico and Central America, the relationship with countries of similar resource endowments (Southeast Asia and China) is rather one of competition, especially in the production of goods intensive in the use of labour; a competition that goes beyond the domestic markets to the destination markets of their exports.";;0;0;;;;undefined;

We observed that students have strongly rooted habits and that it is not possible that they adapt and classify their procedures to solve problems of greater complexity, despite being of daily context. In addition to errors and omissions, we could state that the fundamental concept of ratio and its immediate one, the proportion, represent difficulties and limitations for students when they are outside the algorithmic level.;concentration | problem solving | proportion | Ratio | solution;1;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

The HOME uses an observation/interview format to measure specific interactions between the caregiver and the child, various issues and events that might stimulate the child, and a variety of experiences provided at home or by family members that offer opportunity for growth and development. There are several versions to use from birth to age 3 (Infant-Toddler HOME), the most famous data come the late 60's (1968), it is composed by 45 items (HOME-45) clustered into six subscales. It has a back up of 40 years of publications, over 650 papers, associating with the children's language development, intellectual performance, and academic achievement or psychosocial and socioeconomic characteristics of the family. In Mexico, there are only two published version reports of the use of HOME-45. Most reports refer to the version of Cravioto from the late 60's, with 7 subscales and 62 items (HOME-62) from which there's poor information in the literature about the criteria for to interpreter the outcome results. The aim is to show the results of the implementation of both versions of HOME inventory, and provide criteria for interpretation in a sector of the Mexican population of low socioeconomic status. Material and Methods: We studied 1031 children and their homes from three communities of low socioeconomic status of central Mexico. Explaining the procedures and obtained informed consent, they were visited at home to implement the HOME Inventory and the socio-economic survey, with a 95% interobserver reliability. The procedures performed were approved by the Ethics and Research Committees from National Pediatric Institute. We applied the HOME-45 and HOME-62 in a integrated format to obtain the total score and each subscale from each version. It was also felt cut-off formed three groups with low stimulation (lowest fourth), middle stimulation (middle half) and high stimulation (upper fourth). The HOME-45 applies all the items to children 0 to 3 years; in the HOME-62 before 3 months old are evaluated only 50 items and after 3; 9; 12; 15 and 18 months old apply 54; 55; 57; 59 and 62 items respectively. Depending on the age, 26 to 36 items are common, representing from 58 to 80% of HOME-45 and 52 to 58% of HOME-62. There is no correspondence between the subscales of both versions, they have a different name and composition of items; so, we consider both versions as different. Social survey: A modified version of the socio-economic interview of the National Pediatric Institute was applied, therefore three levels were established: medium low, low and very low social-economic status. Statistical analysis: Four groups were formed by age range of children, to analyze the version HOME-45 and 6 groups for HOME-62 version, depending on the number of applicable items indicated in the format. The analysis related to HOME-62 considered only those items that the format indicates to apply for specific ages. Analyze was performed using JMP statistical software (version 5.01; SAS). We used ANOVA, Student's t test or Tukey Kramer's test to examine differences between means and chi square test to assess differences between proportions; p< 0.05 was considered statistical significance. Results: 52.7% of the children were female, aged 1 to 35 months (0=16.2 ± 9.3 months) mother was the primary caregiver of the child at 87.8%. The mean mother's age was 26.5 ± 5.7 years with a range of 14 to 43 years, the father's age was 29.8 ± 7.34 years. Mother's education mean was 9 years, 24% elementary school or less. HOME-45 Inventory achieved mean score in the population of 31.02 ± 5.68 points, equivalent to a hits proportion of 0.69 ± 0.13, with limits between 0.51 (variety) to 0.81 (responsibity). We found statistical significance differences in the total score of HOME-45 Inventory according to socioeconomic and marital status, birth order of children, education and age of parents. There were also found differences between all subscales of HOME-45 with the socioeconomic status and parent's education. With scores of HOME-45 Total difference was found between children younger than 6 months respect to older. There were also differences in the same sense in the subscales except for Acceptance and Organization subscales. It was considered the cutoff point for low, medium and high stimulation in the total population (0-35 months), to total scale and each subscale, the most important differences observed occurred in children under 6 months of age. HOME-62 Inventory (Cravioto): The total score and the subscales of HOME-62 also showed associations with sociodemographic variables such as education, age and marital status from parents, socioeconomic family status and birth order of children. Scores reached at the HOME-62 were equivalent to the hits proportion of 0.74 ± 0.1, all subscales showed mean higher than 0.5 and three above 0.8. There were major differences in the total score of HOME-62 considering the age group proposed, similar differences were observed in most of the subscales. The cut-off points for types of stimulation of total HOME-62 tend to increase with the age of the child. The same happened with the subscales except Frequency and Stability of adult contact and Emotional climate, were descended. It was compared the relationship between the two versions of HOME once the criteria proposed was applied: 719 family environments were similarly characterized by both versions (69.7%) and 235 environments (22.8%) were defined by the HOME-45 with great stimulation while 80 environments (7.8%) were defined by the HOME-62 with great stimulation too. Discussion: There are no benchmarks in the Mexican population for any of the two versions of HOME used. And the international benchmarks HOME-45 were obtained from American families for over 30 years, being important to have results related to its application and interpretation of HOME-45 in a sector of the Mexican population, allowing contrasting findings regarding those obtained in other latitudes. HOME-62 version is the most widely used in Mexico, but little has been reported about the achieved scores, because there are no criteria for interpretation. The values proposed in this paper can be used in future comparisons with the results of other studies. Differences in scores of each version of HOME according to the age of the children, make it necessary to show the results adjusted by age ranges, common procedure in several instruments. The results of HOME-45 in the population were similar to those obtained in other data, there were no statistical differences with the Little Rock values in the total score, and it existed with the subscales of Acceptance and Organization. Like in that population, the tendency to increase the total score of HOME-45 with age was due mainly to Learning materials and Variety subscales. The results of HOME-62 provide benchmarks for its interpretation in 6 age group and all subscales. If they are applied to the results of the Cravioto's investigation, they are able to differentiate families with a history of malnourished children in the early years of life. Both versions showed ability to discriminate socio-economic characteristics of family. It is necessary to report results of the implementation of HOME in different contexts in qualitative and quantitative terms for a proper comparison and interpretation of the differences between groups as well as analyzing the relationship between the specific results in the subscales of both versions with the development, behavior and welfare of children.";Child development | Family environment | HOME inventory | Socioeconomic status;4;0;;;;undefined;

It will be argued that scientific instruments were used and understood in different ways in these two networks, which required opposing strategies for visualizing the degree and goodness of users' dexterities, thereby fostering the emergence of different collective and individual (epistemic) subjects. I will also argue that these subjects' differences and affinities were constructed around three themes: firstly, the degree of precision needed to establish a correlation between data and the world, or, in other words, the degree of fluidity admitted in connecting material and cultural worlds; secondly, the relevance attributed to body and bod(il)y knowledge in producing reliable data and stabilizing expertise; and thirdly, the weight attributed to opinion in leaning towards ephemeral or lasting data. The first part of the paper looks at the epistemological and political confluences which in late 18th century Spain nurtured the emergence of both a culture of precision and a sphere of public opinion, and to the strained relationship that existed between them. The other three sections explore how Spanish people used different sets of practices to construct different images of themselves as supporters of a moral of precision.";Amateurism | Body knowledge | Enlightenment | Epistemic cultures | Precision | Spain;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The public action analysis is a sociological approach that studies the dynamic between governmental and non-governmental actors in problem solving. The institutional analysis allows us to review the framework of that public action. These theoretical tools are applied to the study of water concession in Aguascalientes, particularly the crisis that it experienced in 1996. The analysis involves changes in formal and informal rules, the emerging of new actors, coordination and cooperation mechanisms and some performing indicators of the service. The article concludes emphasizing some lessons that could be learned from the understanding of the nature of the public action generated around the water management system in Aguascalientes.;Local and municipal government | Public administration | Public services | Water management;5;0;;;;undefined;

The main argument stresses the paradoxical nature of the hypothesis that sustains that the computers could do any work made by a person, showing that perhaps what it really poses is that any person must do his work as if they were a computer.

The focus is on a particular process of teaching. When the expert in mathematics analyses in detail the material of his assignment, he is able to realise that within the structure of knowledge itself, a group of concept maps are found in an implicit way. The maps made by the professor are of great importance when he uses them as a guide for his performance in the classroom. When the teacher utilises in the classroom a guided way of performing with the maps, he implements a didactic strategy and he helps students to develop skills of thought to achieve meaningful learning. This way of performing allows the development of the processes of basic thinking in mathematics; it facilitates the understanding of concepts and the application of them within the process of solving problems. © 2009 Springer-Verlag US.";;1;0;;;;undefined;

My thesis is that our moral notions of violence have changed dramatically in history and that this is apparent if we look back at the ways in which many stories from literature have presented the question of rape. I also argue that feminism has contributed to the moral transformation of the actions of rape, and I point out the ways in which different feminist techniques have allowed the question of violence in rape to be disclosed and understood as a moral harm. In the third part of the article I argue that although feminism has contributed a great deal in the change of our perceptions, the cultural revolution brought by certain feminist groups ended up addressing certain practices that are oppressive to women as acceptable because of so called cultural differences. In order to move out of the dilemma, I propose to use my theory of reflective judgment to provide the grounds for understanding rape as a crime through different and particular practices analyzed through the examples of stories (mainly provided with movies). © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.;Cultural turn | Feminism | Historical understanding | Moral disclosure | Moral harm | Rape | Reflective judgments | Representation;0;0;;;;undefined;

We seek to understand our outsiders' role in the children and youth's career on the streets and to provide ideas for programs and interventions. A group of volunteers in a Mexico City bus station gathered data in field diaries as observations and interviews with street children, youths and helpers, and analyzed them using the Grounded Theory method over a period of 4 years. This retrospective uses the core concept of Social Interface, which is a point of encounter between two social systems, to understand the relationship between the children and their many helpers. The data revealed that the children use the programs and services in their own way and the helpers try to make them ""use it right"" by modifying the programs. Thus, each side protects its own view of the situation from the other and this struggle contributes to keep the children and youths on the streets. Attentive self-awareness is necessary on the part of those who own the programs and services, so that the children's view can be included in the planning, implementing and running of these programs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The administration of L-Dopa diminishes pain perception in humans as well as the response to nociceptive stimuli in animals. Also, the intracerebral microinjection of dopamine in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models (formalin test and deafferentation, respectively) reduces nociceptive response. In this sense, the selective activation of dopamine D2 receptors and the blockade of D1 in the insular cortex and spinal cord diminish nociception. Furthermore, the microinjection of dopamine or amantadine (dopamine releaser) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) also reduces chronic nociception. The efficacy of amantadine has been tested in the treatment of neuropathic pain, even when given as a single dose. There is evidence of the role of amantadine as a releaser of dopamine (DA) calcium channel (N type) dependent in the striatum as well as a low affinity non-competitive antagonist of blockade/non-blockade kinetics of the NMDA receptor. This compound has also been described as a DA agonist and an inhibitor of its reuptake. With this background, we decided to test if the effects of systemically given amantadine related to acute nociception, hyperalgesia and neuropathic nociception can be reverted by a dopaminergic blockade (using haloperidol) within the ACC. The experiments were conducted in agreement with the Ethics Committee of the International Association for the Study of Pain and the approval of the Projects Commission of the Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatría Ramón de la Fuente (INPRF). Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were housed in the INPRF. During the observation period, the animals were maintained in transparent acrylic individual cages with light-dark cycles of 12 × 12 h, with feeding and hydration ad libitum. For all surgical procedures, rats were anaesthetised with halothane 2% mixed with O2 98%. In order to test the dopaminergic effect of amantadine within the ACC in nociception, we used the hyperalgesia model as well as a neuropathic nociception model induced by denervation. In the model of hyperalgesia, carrageenan was injected in the plantar region (50 μl at 1%), followed by a thermonociception test in which paw withdrawal latency was measured. In the neuropathic nociception model, the right sciatic nerve was denervated and chronic nociception was measured as autotomy behaviour. Moreover, in another series of experiments, haloperidol (3 mg/200 nl) was microinjected into the ACC before the induction of hyperalgesia and neuropathic nociception. Amantadine was then injected (90 mg/kg i.p.) and the behavioural development was observed in both models. Systemic amantadine was able to reduce both neuropathic nociception and hyperalgesia. Also, the results show, on the one hand, that haloperidol significantly decreases the antinociceptive effect of amantadine measured as paw withdrawal latency. On the other hand, amantadine can reduce nociception when administered systemically and, according to what has been published previously, when administered directly into the ACC. Our results show that amantadine is effective in diminishing hyperalgesia and nociception induced by deafferentation. This suggests that amantadine can be a therapeutic alternative for the treatment and prevention of neuropathic pain such as phantom limb pain or pain due to deafferentation, among others.;Amantadine | Anterior cingulate cortex | Chronic pain | Dopamine | NMDA;4;0;;;;undefined;

English-speaking children with SLI are very proficient at marking plural on nouns. Spanish has two main nominal plural allomorphs: /s/ and /es/. The /es/ allomorph has received multiple theoretical treatments, including one (e.g., Harris (1991)) which argues that in singular-plural pairs such as flor-flores, the /e/ is epenthetic, while other accounts (e.g., Colina (2003)) argue that synchronically there is an underlying /e/ in the singular form (e.g., flore) which gets deleted by apocope. Child Spanish speakers with SLI in the United States have shown mixed results in their abilities to learn plural marking. They have shown low proficiency on an elicited production task, but have shown high proficiency in spontaneous production data. We show, using a new elicited production task in Mexico with a group of children diagnosed with SLI and two control groups, that performance is close to the high levels previously shown in spontaneous production studies. Further, we show that all children's performance with the epenthetic allomorph /es/ is worse than their performance with the canonical allomorph /s/. Our results suggest that plural marking is not an axis of cross-linguistic variation between Spanish and English among children with SLI. On the basis of the absence of child errors of the flore type and presence of errors of the flors type, our data appear to support the epenthesis account of Harris (1991).;;17;0;;;;undefined;

This degradation is noticed by the application as an excessive service blocking time and a non-negligible packet loss rate. The reasons of this degradation are: slow procedures for address allocation, too much packets exchanged by signaling procedures, and the delay required to establish a new end-to-end delivery path. Although these problems have been widely analyzed, and a number of solutions have been proposed, better handover performances are still needed. In this paper, we propose the introduction of some functionalities into access point equipments to improve the handover performances. These functionalities are based on the reduction of both the address allocation delay and the number of exchanged signaling packets, as well as the parallel execution of certain procedures. Our approach is implemented over the signaling mechanism of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) in such a way that the proposed functionalities can be used by means of extended options. © 2008 IEEE.;;3;0;;;;undefined;

Methods: The data are from a representative multistage probability household survey of 3,005 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years residing in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area that was carried out in 2005. We used discrete time survival analyses to model the net impact of retrospectively reported prior occurrence of traumatic events on ideation, plans and attempts, taking into account the onset of psychiatric disorders. Results: Prevalence of suicidality was high among respondents with traumatic events, ranging from a 43% prevalence of suicidal ideation among those with a history of 'Being raped' to a 25% prevalence of suicide attempts among those that reported 'Purposely injured, tortured or killed someone.' In cross-sectional estimates, any traumatic event was associated with an increase of 3.2 times the odds of suicide ideation, 5.1 times the odds of a plan and 6.6 times the odds of an attempt. Number of events was also associated with increasing suicidality such that those with three or more events were 13.7 times more likely to report a suicide attempt than those with none. Multivariate discrete time survival models that took into account a large number of demographic, suicide-related and psychiatric disorder variables reduced in strength but did not alter these basic relationships. Conclusions: We conclude that traumatic events such as rape and sexual assault have a profound impact upon suicidality and that this relationship is not entirely explained by the onset of psychiatric disorders. Comprehensive interventions for adolescent victims of traumatic events, especially those with a history of cumulative events, should include, but not be restricted to, treatment of any associated psychiatric disorder. © 2007 The Authors.;Adolescence | Epidemiology | Mexico | Risk factors | Suicide | Survey | Trauma;55;0;;;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

Social science research on recent changes in rural landscape of mega-cities tends to be limited to case studies in Latin-American nations. This study analyses the socioecomic dynamics of farming land use and the interactions between multiple cultural variables and the environment. Fieldwork was carried out during the 2002-2003 period in rural livelihoods of the five high mountain towns of south Mexico City. Data obtained from participatory survey and ethnographic techniques were integrated to assess changes in rural landscape and resource management and how urbanization, deforestation and market oriented agricultural production result in different livelihoods within a similar urban fringe context. The dynamic of mixture of urban and rural landscapes is based on farm productivity and social capital factors.

This process is characterized by an increase in morbidity, a diminished independence and adaptability, deterioration of socio-familiar models, retirement from work, a decrease in the socio-economic capacity and psychophysical restriction. The importance in this population is pointed out regarding chronic and degenerative diseases, whose longer duration implies more expensive therapies and medicines associated to longer periods of hospitalization. The prevalence in substance consumption at this stage of life is pronounced towards medical drugs, but not to psychotropics of abuse. However, many abuse/dependency and self-medication problems are promoted. After the exposition on the physiopathology of old age, and its relation with ethanol consumption, drugs of medical use and psycho-drugs, some participant factors in the physiological changes, the multiple pathology and poly-pharmacy are discussed, indicating with didactic interest the Adverse Reaction to Medicines and the recommendations to follow for their suitable prescription. Starting from the main and more recent official data available in Mexico, whose numbers show a discouraging panorama that it impels to the reflection and search of possible institutional solutions for medium and long term handling, it is concluded alluding to the danger of the ""silent epidemic"", as a threat to their security and subsistence. At the same time, the necessity for a socio-cultural change and the redefinition of the meaning of old age, in terms of its value and for the benefit of new forms of communitarian integration in its wider sense is stated.";Addictions | Drugs of medical use | Old age | Physiopathology | Poly-pharmacy | Psychotropics | Self-medication;1;0;;;;undefined;

METHOD: Data are presented from the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey, a representative household survey of 3,005 adolescents ages 12 to 17 in metropolitan Mexico City who were gathered in 2005, regarding lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of suicide ideation, plan, and attempt and demographic and psychiatric disorders risk factors. RESULTS: Lifetime ideation was reported by 11.5% of respondents, whereas 3.9% reported a lifetime plan and 3.1% a lifetime suicide attempt. Onset of suicidality started around age 10 and at age 15 showed the highest hazards. Suicide ideators were more likely to report a plan and attempt within the first year of onset of ideation. Suicidality was more likely to occur among females. The presence of one or more mental disorders was strongly related to suicide ideation, plan, and attempt. Among ideators only dysthymia was consistently related to a plan and attempt. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention efforts should focus on assessment and target adolescents with mental disorders, particularly mood disorders, to be effective in prevention.

Methods: A total of 5001 NCS respondents were re-interviewed (87.6% of baseline sample) in the NCS-2. Three sets of baseline (NCS) risk factors were considered as predictors of the first onset and persistence of SROs: socio-demographics, lifetime DSM-III-R disorders, and SROs. Results: New onsets included 6.2% suicide ideation, 2.3% plan, 0.7% gesture, and 0.9% attempts. More than one-third of respondents with a baseline history of suicide ideation continued to have suicide ideation at some time over the intervening decade. Persistence was lower for other SROs. The strongest predictors of later SROs were baseline SROs. Prospective associations of baseline mental disorders with later SROs were largely limited to the onset and persistence of ideation. Limitations: Although data were gathered prospectively, they were based on retrospective reports at both baseline and follow-up. Conclusions: Baseline history of SROs explained much of the association of mental disorders with later SROs. It is important clinically to note that many of the risk factors known to predict onset of SROs also predict persistence of SROs. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This interest is due, on one hand, to the rise of the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (Zapatista Army of National Liberation, or EZLN) and, on the other hand, to US President George W. Bush's concern for the security of his country. Another aspect is the importance of the Mexico-Guatemala-Belize borderland as the link between northern Mexico and Central America, an area with huge potential in strategic resources, the use of which could revitalize the integration process in the Americas and improve US economic competitiveness in the context of globalization. Although the concept of globalization is not discussed in this chapter, its premise is that there is a dialectic of inclusion and exclusion in backward regions, as in southern Mexico and Central America (see Villafuerte 2002). © 2007 by University of Ottawa Press.

Lifetime ideation was reported by 8.1% of respondents, while 3.2% reported a lifetime plan and 2.7% a lifetime suicide attempt. Onset of all outcomes was highest in adolescence and early adulthood. The risk of transition from suicide ideation to plan and attempt was highest within the first year of onset of ideation. The presence of one or more temporally prior DSM-IV/CIDI (Composite International Diagnostic Instrument) disorder was strongly related to each suicide-related outcome. Suicidal outcomes are prevalent, have an early AOO, and are strongly related to temporally prior mental disorders in Mexico.

In the particular case where we have three different hotel chains located in three different tourist regions, we show that the incentive of hotel chains to invest in environmental quality depends on the demand for days of rest on the part of tourists and on the level of aggregate income. We also show that if total income increase, then the incentive to invest in environmental quality increases in the region where the price of a hotel room is lower. © University of the Aegean.;Environmental investment | Hotelling competition | Service quality | Sustainable tourism;6;0;;;;undefined;

As described in Maynard Smith (1974), the growth of natural populations is more accurately depicted by a logistic growth law. In this paper we analyze how the Ramsey growth model is affected by logistic growth of population, comparing it with the classic Ramsey model. We show that there is a unique nontrivial steady state of the model and that the parameters of the logistic equation play no role in determining long run equilibrium per worker level of consumption and capital. In addition, we study the stability of the model showing that its nontrivial equilibrium is a saddle point.;;44;0;;;;undefined;

All these trends have provoked a severe damage on the planet's ecosystems. Nowadays, it is not only necessary, but urgent to modify these trends and to apply corrective actions. In this work, an innovative sustainable construction system called ECOPET 21, has been applied in a house prototype and integrated with the application of bioclimatic design principles and sustainable technologies as well as environmental planning, aimed at the development of ecological sustainable communities, particularly for tropical regions. The principles and benefits of this approach are presented and their benefits demonstrated. The main objective of this project is to implement ECOPET 21 with the integration of sustainable technologies into bioclimatic architectural design and rural planning actions in tropical regions, based on the use of renewable energies, taking into account and emphasizing the economic and social issues, aimed at promoting a multiple effect and a consistent sustainable development with local and global benefits.;Bioclimatic architecture | Climate | Comfort | Design strategies | Ecological communities | ECOPET 21 | Housing | Renewable energies | Sustainability | Tropical countries;0;0;;;;undefined;

This paper focuses on international periodical publications where more than 75 percent of the articles in the social sciences and humanities and well over 90 percent in the natural sciences are written in English. The shift towards English implies that an increasing number of scientists whose mother tongue is not English have already moved to English for publication. Consequently, other international languages, namely French, German, Russian, Spanish and Japanese lose their attraction as languages of science. Many observers conclude that it has become inevitable to publish in English, even in English only. The central question is whether the actual hegemony of English will create a total monopoly, at least at an international level, or if changing global conditions and language policies may allow alternative solutions. The paper analyses how the conclusions of an inevitable monopoly of English are constructed, and what possible disadvantages such a process might entail. Finally, some perspectives of a new plurilingual approach in scientific production and communication are sketched. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.;;174;0;;;;undefined;

As a result, the impact of mental disorders was underestimated until the last two decades of the previous century. This perception began to change as a result of two factors: On the one hand, the study of the Global Burden of Disease reported by Murray and Lopez, and, on the other hand, the definition of mental disorders by the American Psychiatric Association. The common element shared by these two factors is the inclusion of the concept of disability. Disability is the deterioration of the expected functioning of a subject of a particular age and sex in a social context. It is a part of the social cost of illness. Objective: To assess the disability burden associated with depression, mania, agoraphobia, social phobia, general anxiety, panic disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) according to the Mexican Psychiatric Survey and to compare results with the disability produced by some chronic non-psychiatric conditions. Method: This survey is based on a stratified, multistage area, probabilistic sample of adults living in urban areas of Mexico. The instrument used was the third version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. We report the 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorders as defined by DSM-IV criteria. We also evaluated non-psychiatric chronic conditions like diabetes, arthritis, hypertension, backache, and other painful illnesses, identified in general as ""chronic conditions"". Indicators of disability were Sheehan's scale and number of work days lost. This is an easy and fast self reporting scale, which can be used both in the clinic or research. The sub-scales can be added or averaged to obtain a total score. The scale of responses is a horizontal line with numerals from 0 to 10 and five verbal descriptions, with the description ""Not at all"" corresponding to a value of 0; ""Mild"" rangimg from 1 to 3; ""Moderate"" from 4 to 6; ""Severe"" from 7 to 9; and ""Very severe"" corresponding to 10. Results: Close relationships and social life were the areas most deeply affected. The disorders found to produce the highest levels of disability were depression, social phobia, and PTSD. The lowest disability levels were observed in chronic conditions. On the total score of Sheehan's scale, disorders with the highest level of disability were PTSD (mean 5.35 ± 0.307) and depression (mean 4.72 ± 0.167). Depression and panic attacks were the disorders by which most days were lost on average in the previous year (25.51, CI95:16.53-34.5; 20, CI 95: 3.02-36.97). Days lost were lower in chronic conditions than in the seven mental disorders studied (6.89, CI95: 3.04-10.74). Discussion: This is the first paper to demonstrate the impact of mental disorders in Latin America evaluating the association of disability with common mental disorders. We have shown that mental disorders, especially depression, are associated with deficits in functioning and result in the loss of work days. We have also shown that persons with common mental disorders have, on average, higher levels of disability than those observed among persons with a wide range of chronic physical conditions. These results are consistent with prior studies in North America and Europe that have found that persons with common mental disorders experience substantial disability in social role functioning.";Depression | Disability | Lost days | Mental disorders | Social cost;16;0;;;;undefined;

It is found that urbanization and peri-urban agriculture result in changes at the regional level of rural landscape and management of natural resources, which imply different trends in local development. It is concluded that environmental policies for periurban agricultural production systems have to include the design, operation and evaluation of strategies for territorial sustainability management through the enhancement of regional social capital.;Distrito federal | Guadalajara | Local development | Mexico | Periurban agriculture;3;0;;;;undefined;

In a first approach architecture is considered as a 'second nature', one that is fit to meet man's needs, which goes beyond functional and pragmatic issues, and include in a fundamental way the spiritual aspects, those which ultimately define our human nature. In a second phase a historical-interpretative analysis is developed for a better understanding of the main practices in sustainable architecture over the last two decades of the 20th century. The concepts of dialogism and the hermeneutic trilogy (pre-figuration, con-figuration and re-figuration) developed by M. Bajtin and Paul Ricoeur, respectively, are explored as a methodological structure to analyze and interpret a sustainable architecture. The idea is to bind dialogism and sustainability as one concept, in order to approach architecture in an integral and holistic way, and to try to visualize it as a multidimensional cultural phenomenon. Here, the main hypothesis is explained, one which establishes that both, biophysical and tangible factors, as well as social and intangible ones, are indispensable cultural parameters to consider when designing a truly sustainable architecture.;Dialogical architecture | Dialogical sustainability | Qualitative interpretation of space | Second nature | Sustainable architecture | Sustainable architecture assessment;3;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Clinical judgments about the likelihood of suicide attempt would be aided by an index of risk factors that could be quickly assessed in diverse settings. We sought to develop such a risk index for 12-month suicide attempts among suicide ideators. Method. The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a household survey of adults aged 18+, assessed the 12-month occurrence of suicide ideation, plans and attempts in a subsample of 5692 respondents. Retrospectively assessed correlates include history of prior suicidality, sociodemographics, parental psychopathology and 12-month DSM-IV disorders. Results. Twelve-month prevalence estimates of suicide ideation, plans and attempts are 2.6, 0.7 and 0.4% respectively. Although ideators with a plan are more likely to make an attempt (31.9%) than those without a plan (9.6%), 43% of attempts were described as unplanned. History of prior attempts is the strongest correlate of 12-month attempts. Other significant correlates include shorter duration of ideation, presence of a suicide plan, and several sociodemographic and parental psychopathology variables. Twelve-month disorders are not powerful correlates. A four-category summary index of correlates is strongly related to attempts among ideators [area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)=0.88]. The distribution (conditional probability of attempt) of the risk index is: 19.0% very low (0.0%), 51.1% low (3.5%), 16.2% intermediate (21.3%), and 13.7% high (78.1%). Two-thirds (67.1%) of attempts were made by ideators in the high-risk category. Conclusions. A short, preliminary risk index based on retrospectively reported responses to fully structured questions is strongly correlated with 12-month suicide attempts among ideators, with a high concentration of attempts among high-risk ideators. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.;;188;0;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

There also exists programs that is available to the employer in defining migrant working conditions, which if imposed on citizens or Canadian residents, would be socially and legally unacceptable. In addition, vulnerability is accentuated, and in order to create a flexible, disposable and unprotected manual labor force, gender constructs are exploited. In one farm not farm from Montreal, a program requires unmarried women in gathering strawberries while the same program demands men to be married and heads of households. Therefore, access to work for the woman as a means of subsistence does not signify a social achievement because she is a passive subject whose vulnerability allows entry into the market. On a grander realization, globalization has an impact on the process of exploitation and in a patriarchal system.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

These are globalization, organization and the ethics of liberation. The first section recognizes the specific meaning of globalization when it is confronted with the prevailing Eurocentrism. The result should be a critical posture that understands the world as a system that goes far beyond Europe. The second section discusses the nature of the problems of organization related to globalization. The organization of human activities related to production and commerce required a permanent process of 'simplification'. This was achieved by means of the 'rationalization' of the world of life in all its economic, political, cultural and religious subsystems. One of its undeniable consequences has been the production of victims and exclusion, proving the asymmetrical organization of 'modern' life. The final section, centred in the ethics of liberation, will allow us to clarify the elements and determinants for the transformation of this modern condition to guarantee the production, reproduction and development of life. A new type of theoretical possibility emerges to think of the world as a trans-modern organization of life characterized by its plurality, diversity and reasonability.

Three hundred eighteen bisexual and gay males (BG) and 188 bisexual and lesbian females (BL) were surveyed. By means of a self-applied questionnaire, variables of interest were researched. The following trends were observed: an important number of men and women interviewed suffered violence in their childhood and adolescence because they defied gender stereotypes, and not because of their sexual orientation; BG males were more often victims of violence than BL females. Within the BG group, those who challenged gender stereotypes were more frequently attacked than those who did not; men were identified as aggressors more frequently than women; and in the BG group, gender stereotype transgression was associated with the perception of suffering violence in the future. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

With only 1.47 percent of the world's surface area, Mexico ranks fourth in biological diversity, first in number of species of pine trees, second in reptiles, and fifth in mammals and plants. Mexico is home to an estimated 10 percent of all known species, many of them found nowhere else on earth. It is the world's leader in the production of silver, celestita, honey, fruits, citrus, denim, and cement. It ranks as the 12th largest economy, second as the main destination of direct foreign investment among developing countries, third in economic growth, and seventh as a tourist destination. Despite the country's natural resources and economic strengths, “the model of development that our country has followed ever since the last century has not been able to prevent the overexploitation of natural resources, nor revert the deterioration of the environment caused by production activities, growth in population, and expansion into urban areas.” Illegal logging in protected forests has shrunk important habitats; one-third of the rainforest was lost in the last 20 years; water, air, and land have reached shocking levels of pollution; and the loss of biodiversity is alarming. The relationship between environmental protection and poverty is little understood in Mexico and puts at risk our economic and social potential. Constant migration from rural areas to the cities has been identified as harmful for society, the family, and the economy.";;1;0;;;;undefined;

In Castille its use established in the course of the definitive settling down of the Court in Madrid (1561). From this time on, coaches contributed considerably to change staff and etiquette of the Royal Stables, as well as the public appearences of the King. At the same time, from the end of the 1570's, the coach was adopted by the aristocracy, the social class which was beginning to rule in stead of the «Letrados», as the «pragmaticas» (laws against luxury) of 1578 an 1593 reveal. The alliance between carriage and courtier however became definitive from 1611 on, when the use of carriages was institionalized. From that moment on it was necessary to obtain a licence from the «Consejo de Castilla» in order to go by carriage, wich in deed converted its use in an exclusive domain of the elites governing the monarchy, that is, of the court aristocracy, the ministers and servants of the royal house, the high clergy and those habitants of great urban centres with good relations to the latter. Once the institutionalisation was concluded around 1630, on the one hand efforts were made to fiscalize carriages (in 1651, 1658, 1667, 1675, 1684 and 1688) and of the other, several measures aiming to maintaing the monopoly of a small cout elite were carried through, the most important of wich were the pragmaticas of 1674, 1678, 1684 and 1691.;Coaches | Court | Courtier | Law against luxury | Sedan chairs;4;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Vicente Fox, from the PAN (Partido Accion Nacional), a party historically geared to questioning the old Mexican political system, won the election. He was solidly rooted in the business community and during his campaign, he pushed forward demands in favour of freedom of association and trade union democracy. Inasmuch as ""trade union corporatism"" had been one of the pillars of the old political system, it was expected that the PRI's defeat would entail greater wear and tear on the leadership of the CT (Congreso del Trabajo), a phenomenon that had become increasingly more evident since the late 80s. The CT is a key organization of the labour movement. Since 1966, its members have included the most important trade union groups, as well as the most powerful national industrial trade unions. In this classic example of corporatist political exchange, union representatives had access to greater financial resources and played an important role within the state administration in return for their cooperation in industrial and political matters. The CT acted like a transmission belt for the PRI, which controlled the levers of the state, and they greatly contributed to the PRI's electoral hegemony. In particular, the unions exercised a tight control over worker demands. Today the CT is in a state of collapse. The question that remains to be answered is whether the Fox government has improved the opportunities to renew and renovate trade unionism and to put aside the traditional corporatist practices and inertias. The following issue also needs to be considered: What has been the capacity of the ""new trade unionism"" to seize such opportunities and stir up the transition towards new forms of democratic governance based on the autonomy of trade union organizations, workers citizenship, and democracy, a process which we label ""labour transition."" With this perspective in mind and within the broader framework of the trends initiated by the political transition of 1988, this article examines the key elements of the structure of political opportunities in which the protagonists of the labour world evolve today. The article also reviews the differential impact of these opportunities on the old and new trade unionism and union responses to the changes process. The first part of this article presents the context of trade union renewal by identifying the factors which explain the failure of the process of labour transition towards democratic forms of governance. The second part looks at the opportunities created by the political transition and change. The third part analyzes trade union response to the challenges arising from the new context and the endogenous factors which have impacted on their behaviour. The article concludes that, while opportunities for union renewal increased substantially during the Fox administration (2000-2006), labour transition currently finds itself in a crucial stage of development. The outcome will depend, among other factors, on the capacity of trade unions to take advantage of the present crisis of corporative arrangement and develop new patterns of relations with their regular members, the State, and the employers. The ""new trade unionism"" has been able to establish its autonomy vis-à-vis government interference, but it has not paid the same kind of attention to internal democracy, transparency, and accountability. The ""new trade unionism"" has not promoted the participation of the regular members nor sought to replace old trade union resources. For example, it did not invest in organizing campaigns, which depend less on government or company will. As a result, the ""new trade unionism"" is unable to represent in an efficient manner the interests of the workers in the context of globalization. Although the result of this process will depend on a combination of factors which are exogenous and endogenous to trade unions, significant evidence confirms that the mechanisms upon which the Mexican labour peace was sustained, not to mention the so called strength of trade union organizations, have ceased to operate effectively. Three key factors reveal this crisis of trade union corporatism: (1) the gradual increase in the autonomy of union leaders vis-à-vis the State apparatus; (2) the weakening of the legitimacy of the national presidency as a reliable arbitrator in settling labour conflicts and trade-union rivalries and disputes; and (3) the increasing role of employers in the control of the organizational process, be it directly or via the mediation of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare of the Fox Administration. This situation allows us to predict that, regardless of the winner of the presidential elections of July 2006, it will be difficult to ignore the need to create alternative forms of labour governance. © RI/IR, 2006.";;1;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

A curriculum of indigenous language preservation and cultural affirmation, overturning the previous Spanish-only programme, has been developed by a group of indigenous teachers in two P'urhepecha elementary schools, ‘Miguel Hidalgo’ of San Isidro and ‘Benito Juárez’ in the neighbouring village of Uringuitiro. Today, the P'urhepecha language is the nucleus of the curriculum. With the previous curriculum largely discredited, the bilingual teachers embarked on a project that would both provide instruction to children in a language they understand, and contribute to the preservation of their indigenous language, which in these communities, in all cases, is children's first language (L1). Being cognizant of the importance of learning Spanish as a second language, a major current planning and curriculum design priority is to find a way to integrate Spanish language instruction into the academic subject areas in accordance with current models of content-based second language teaching. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;Bilingual curriculum | Common Underlying Proficiency | Indigenous language bilingualism | Literacy | Mexico | Spanish as a second language;8;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

This paper describes the 12-month prevalence, severity and demographic correlates of 16 DSM-IV psychiatric disorders and service utilization in the Mexican urban population aged 18-65 years of age. This is representative of 75% of the national adult population. Method. The sample design was a strict probability selection scheme. The response rate was 76.6%. The World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was installed on laptops and administered by lay interviewers. An international WHO task force carried out its translation into Spanish. Results. The 12-month prevalence of any disorder was 12.1%. The most common disorders were specific phobia (4.0%), major depressive disorder (3.7%) and alcohol abuse or dependence (2.2%). The 12-month prevalence of very severe disorders was 3.7% of which only 24% used any services. Age was the only variable associated with any 12-month disorder, with the younger more likely to report any disorder. Income was associated with severity, with low and low-average incomes more likely to report a 12-month disorder. Females were more likely to report a mood and anxiety disorder, but less likely to report a substance disorder. The group of separated/widowed/divorced was more likely to report a mood and an impulse-control disorder. Conclusions. The results show that while psychiatric disorders are common in the Mexican population, very severe mental disorders are less common and there is extreme under-utilization of mental health services. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.;;161;0;;;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

Aromatizable androgens: androstenedione (A) and testosterone (T), a non-aromatizable androgen: 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), as well as estrogens (E 2 and E1) alone or in combination with DHT, were administered in gonadectomized, sexually experienced males, for 3 weeks. In addition, plasma levels of these steroids were determined. Gonadectomy completely suppressed masculine sexual behavior (MSB) after 4 weeks. Both A and T replacements restored all the sexual behavior parameters in castrated hamsters by the 3rd week of treatment, with A being more potent in restoring all copulatory series and maintaining all MSB parameters, including long intromissions. Castrated males treated with DHT showed little interest in the female and did not display any copulatory behavior. Gonadectomized males treated with estrogens alone showed active anogenital investigation and displayed some mounts, but did not ejaculate. Males treated with estrogens combined with DHT had longer latencies and less number of ejaculations than males treated with aromatizable androgens. Long intromissions were observed only in males treated with T or A. Plasma levels of A were significantly higher than T levels in intact males. In males treated with A both androgens and estrogens were present in plasma. These results support the notion that aromatizable androgens, mainly A, but not non-aromatizable androgens or even estrogens in combination with DHT, play a relevant role in the endocrine regulation of MSB in the golden hamster.;Androgens | Castration | Golden hamsters | Male sexual behavior;28;0;;;;undefined;

The authors examine the Federal government's response to disasters since 1985 and conclude that the CPNS operates in a manner that is contrary to the precepts that shaped its design and structure. The authors conclude that orthodox beliefs and assumptions about disasters rationalise the current operations of the CPNS. They argue that a holistic perspective of disasters, rather than a change in institutional design and organisation, is required in order to operationalise intergovernmental cooperation and citizen participation.

The Mexican doctors studied madness, drawing on what was confidently regarded as a firm basis of epistemological knowledge. Using modern physiology they entered a discussion that had begun some time before in Europe. Encountering hysteria, an illness presumed to be caused by 'over-civilization', they searched for a universal definition. The doctors tried to impose a unifying concept onto the diverse symptoms of hysteria, and, although imitating European ideas, the discourse became distinctive in its attempts to relate hysteria to science and modernity so that all three would make sense. My interest in this article is the feminine; not a reconstruction of the relationship that medicine established between hysteria and the feminine, but a search for a space within the discourse that deconstructs identity and stereotypes. The feminine appears when the coherence of medical discourse is ruptured and when, to explain the illness, the doctors stop attempting to define it.

I propose an analysis of the Mexican case to review some of the problems to which the radio model in the region is subject and that have, in many cases, their roots in the rules that guide the operation of the mass media. This analysis also will provide the key to understanding the challenges that must be met by countries that are making fundamental changes, that through the law can appoint lines of action, that become communication policies, and that can develop more democratic ways of social participation in radio. Understanding the principles that shape the radio-communication model of a country is a determining factor for discovering the characteristics of this medium. Indeed, analyzing radio regulations tells us about the society that makes those regulations. © 2005, Sage Publications.

Prevalence of tolerance was also higher in those countries with high detrimental drinking pattern scores. Sensitivity of the RAPS4-QF for heavy drinking was uniformly high across countries, while maintaining good specificity, and did not vary by detrimental drinking patterns. Conclusions: Findings suggest the RAPS4 and RAPS4-QF may hold promise cross-nationally.

Methods: Data are from the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey (M-NCS). This population survey was carried out in 2001-2003 in a sample of 5,782 respondents of 18 years and older. Onset of ideation, a plan, and suicide attempt, as well as psychiatric and service use correlates were estimated using survival analysis. Results: Of the respondents, 8.3% reported lifetime ideation, 3.2% reported a lifetime plan and 2.8% reported lifetime suicide attempt(s). The prevalence for 12-month suicidal behaviors was 2.3%, 1.0% and 0.6%, respectively. Suicidal behaviors were more prevalent in early adolescence and early adulthood and became less common after the mid-thirties, with the exception of suicidal ideation that continues into older ages. Having met criteria for one or more of the DSM-IV disorders assessed in the survey was common among suicide ideators (60.9%), planners (75.6%) and attempters (74.6%), and was a strong risk factor for suicidal behaviors, with odds ratios of 4.8 for ideation, 10.2 for plan and 9.6 for attempt. Approximately one of every four lifetime attempters reported to have ever seen a psychiatrist. Conclusions: As in many other countries, mental disorders have an important impact on suicidal behaviors in Mexico. Intervention efforts aimed at identifying and treating persons at or before the onset of suicidal ideation is strongly recommended.;Epidemiology | Psychiatric disorder | Risk factors | Suicide | Suicide attempt | Survey;14;0;;;;undefined;

Mexico's position in the international biosafety panorama is very complex: it is the only member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that ratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and must implement its provisions. Moreover, Mexico is the Centre of Origin and Diversity (COD) of maize, the main staple food of Mesoamerica, and a region of extraordinarily rich biological diversity. The large asymmetries with its NAFTA partners and the need to meet its commercial agreements, put Mexico in a difficult situation with respect to biodiversity conservation. The paper informs about the findings of transgenic maize in Oaxaca as well as the learning needed, and the challenges faced by the Mexican Government in order to implement the appropriate biosafety measures.

Each of them guarantees the uniqueness of optimal policies of discounted Markov decision processes. The conditions presented here impose hypotheses specifically on the state space X, the action space A, the admissible action sets A(x), x ∈ X, the transition probability Q, and on the cost function c. Two of these conditions require mainly convexity assumptions, but the third one does not need this kind of assumptions. However, it needs certain stochastic order relations in Q, and the cost function c to reach its minimum with respect to the actions, just in one action. We illustrate the conditions with several examples including, in particular, discrete models, the linear regulator problem, and also a model of an inventory control system.;Convexity | Discounted Markov decision processes | Stochastic order | Uniqueness of optimal policies;24;0;;;;undefined;

While an association between cigarette smoking and depression has been established in Anglo populations, replication of tobacco-depression associations in countries where smoking is growing may provide important new insights. The objectives of this study were to estimate the association of depressive symptomatology with tobacco smoking, number of cigarettes smoked daily, and smoking cessation in a representative sample of the Mexican population. Method. The data come from the Third National Addictions Survey (1998) conducted by the Mexican Ministry of Health, representative of Mexico's civilian population residing in cities and towns with 2500+ inhabitants, aged 18-64. Part of a multi-stage, stratified, probability sample, 1935 men and women answered a version of the survey that also included the CES-D depression scale. Analyses addressed the survey's complex design and controlled for income and educational level. Results. Among women only, current smokers had twice the odds of elevated depressive symptomatology than never smokers (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.5, p=0.002). For men, only those smoking a pack or more a day had greater odds of depressive symptomatology (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.6-21.9, p=0.008). Overall, former smokers who ceased smoking within 6 months had lower odds of depressive symptomatology than current smokers (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.0, p=0.042). Conclusions. These findings add to the accumulating evidence for the association between smoking and depression in different cultures and populations. © 2004 Cambridge University Press.;;41;0;;;;undefined;

It also shows that these have been constrained by the militant and powerful National Teachers' Union. Although the new government has achieved some progress in equity and management, the quality of education can be seen to remain inferior. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.;;12;0;;;;undefined;

The authors report on new research which examined PT's record in enabling people with different degrees of vulnerability to build assets and protect themselves from both sudden shocks and more predictable demands for lump sums of cash. Proyecto Tequisquiapan was found to be relatively more useful for the most vulnerable households. Its successes rely on its small scale and on the commitment of its staff, whose salaries are subsidised, to innovation and experimentation in order to remain relevant to members' changing and differentiated financial lifeworlds. This stands in contrast to the current trend towards large-scale commercialised microfinance. The World Bank, the authors argue, should take note. © 2004 Oxfa GB.;;2;0;;;;undefined;Ford Foundation

While the region was successful in reversing the large macroeconomic disequilibria of the 1980s, economic volatility persists, mainly associated with greater integration to the world economy. More importantly, the social impact of the long period of reform remains controversial. Through a review of comparable economic and social data for the region, it is suggested in this paper that such inconsistency-between economic and social performance-may be the result of deep flaws in the design of development policies. Over-concern for macroeconomic stability, fast growth and rapid integration to the international economy has resulted in insufficient attention being given to the social cost of adjustment and structural change. Social policies have been mainly concerned with the administration of scarce resources and the creation of safety nets to counter the negative social impact of economic policy. Less attention has been given, however, to resolving long-entrenched inequalities in society, to improving the productivity of labour and broad-based access to productive capital. We illustrate one aspect of this discussion through a review of employment trends in the manufacturing sector in Mexico to show that, in spite of rapid job creation, lack of integration with the rest of the economy has generated overall poor employment results, partly a result of the failure of industrial policies to provide a timely response to the many challenges faced by opening up international competition. This case study helps us to support the claim that what is probably lacking in Latin America is a strategic approach to policy design to bring consistency between rapid changes in the economy and longer term development objectives, between the short and the long term, between stability and growth, and between rising productivity and improvement of welfare in the largest developmental sense. © 2004 International Development Centre, Oxford.;;3;0;;;;undefined;

Anthropological studies have shown that high church-formation rates are related to Pentecostal asceticism and organizational flexibility. Rural Pentecostal migrants in Mexican cities retain a worldview that is largely centered on the work ethic and proscriptions of costly worldly behaviors. A comparison of findings from urban and rural settings shows how Pentecostal ideology allows for a pragmatic stance toward prosperity and community structure.

The spellings 〈E〉 instead of 〈I〉 and 〈P〉 instead of 〈PH〉 in Meleponus can be easily explained. Thus, these names, even though similar to μελίφθογγο ς, used as personal name in Italy, could reflect some kind of innovation and singularity owing to the fact that they are unattested elsewhere.;Greek proper names | Latin inscriptions from Hispania | Onomastics;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Since there are many different points of view in feminist theory with regard to how to deal with the idea of women's rights, this article is divided into three sections. In the first section, I focus on how some important normative contents about democracy and rights have already been accepted by many different theorists who speak from critical perspectives. In the second section, I deal with how women's struggles have gained consensus about the importance of defending the idea of rights for their own struggles to overcome their exclusion. In the third and last section, I turn back to the theoretical efforts by leading feminists, in order to show how these struggles from women all over the world can be thematized in our global scenario. © 2004, Sage Publications.

A range of different relations between marginalised groups, social movements, and the government are articulated through experiences of participation both in created and invited spaces. The Zapatista movement has fostered changes in relationships between marginalised groups, including indigenous people and women, and the state - particularly the national government and regional development programmes created during the last several years. These regional programmes represent the national government's position on important issues, including the nature of socioeconomic regional development, indigenous people's rights, and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas. Differences and commonalities in participation in spaces created by the Zapatista movement in autonomous municipalities, versus participation in formalised spaces within the government's regional development programmes provide some important insights about the role of participation in bringing about change.;;5;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The purpose of this paper is to undertake a critical analysis of the relationship between globalization and state reform. The results of the analysis are the following: 1) Under the dictates of the world economy, states carry out reforms that allow them to adjust their functioning, 2) Under globalization, the real historical protagonists are large economic conglomerates, 3) International financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are the proponents of the changes that must be made on a state level, the objective being to maintain or increase demand conditions (which are in general satisfied), and the process of capital accumulation, 4) As a counterpart the State reduces its participation in solving social problems, which tend to worsen, 5) Paradoxically by promoting the vitality of democracy, capitalism cannot avoid the promotion of governments that attempt to administer public interests in order to diminish the growing inequalities between that result from the market system. The conclusion is that the system does not resolve the contradictions between political liberty and economic restriction for the majority, but those possibilities are open. The solution requires that the world society as a whole advances and promotes those societies that resist the exclusion of the majority, and which maintain their battle to generalize in those societies that have isolated manifestations of the same, and that they widen the social bases that require participation in the advantages of globalization.;Economy | Globalization | Public administration | State | State reform;1;0;;;;undefined;

The paper returns to Sraffa's own approach and identifies two characteristic elements: methodologically, it is of a 'dynamic' nature (it considers a potential move of the rate of profits) and, analytically, the switch-points are the common intersection of several wage-profit curves. An internal critique consists in showing the existence of fake switches, which are at the intersection of two wage-profit curves but, unexpectedly, are not switch-points.;Change of methods | Fake switch | Joint production | Sraffa;0;0;;;;undefined;

The controller has constant risk sensitivity λ, and the performance of a control policy is measured by the corresponding risk-sensitive average cost criterion. Assuming that the optimality equation has a solution, it is shown that the value iteration scheme can be implemented to obtain, in a finite number of steps, (1) an approximation to the optimal λ-sensitive average cost with an error less than a given tolerance, and (2) a stationary policy whose performance index is arbitrarily close to the optimal value. The argument used to establish these results is based on a modification of the original model, which is an extension of a transformation introduced by Schweitzer (1971) to analyze the the risk-neutral case. © 2003, INFORMS.;;13;0;;;;undefined;

However, the endocrine changes induced by this treatment are controversial. In the present study, we analyzed the levels of corticosterone and testosterone in rats neonatally treated with CMI in response to chronic stress by repeated immersion in cold water. Results obtained in the forced swim test corroborated the effect of neonatal CMI administration, showing a significant increase in immobility time. The testosterone response to stress was similar in both control and CMI-treated rats. Concerning corti-costerone, there was a significantly lower response to stress in CMI-treated rats. The data suggest that CMI induces permanent changes in the reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, without affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Copyright © 2003 S.

He studies the approaches to the idea of culture in different sections of the dailies—cultural, economic, social—and how they relate to local, national, and global processes. According to him, written press is one place in which dissemination of cultural issues becomes more eloquent. By analyzing the written press, it is possible to note a reformulation of the concept of culture associated with its new role in socioeconomic and political processes. This expansion of culture does not take place in the same way in different sections of the dailies. The hypothesis explored is that differences stem from ways in which the local, national, and global are organized in diverse cultural fields. In so doing, we can better understand the aspects in which Mexican society is globalizing. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

The general idea the author offers is that there is a specific dialogue between mass culture and the secular rites that significantly elaborates the construction of meaning. To do this, the author proposes an analysis of the transformation of what he has called the ritual chain among the popular sectors, which reproduces, symbolically, not only the change in perceptions of what is real, but it also acts out the new social practices. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

By exploring the nature of segregation patterns that have given shape to the present expansion of movie theatres, the author shows that the regaining of audience is restricted: although it is true that at the birth of the new century audiences can be considered multimedia (attending movie theaters, using video, as well as open and restricted TV), the exhibition of movies turns out to be more accessible to high-and middle-class populations as an experience of public sociability. Lower sectors have less opportunities to experience public entertainment and have to rely on open television and video as means of amusement. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

On the one hand, the warning launched by Hale (1992), Krauss (1992) and others regarding the possible death of 90% of the languages of the world by the end of the twenty-first century as a result of linguistic globalisation has strengthened a series of movements and concerns for the most endangered languages. Some of them relate the dangers of a reduction in biodiversity with those involved in linguistic diversity (compare Harmon 1996; Skutnabb-Kangas 2000). In general they are champions of an unlimited defence of all languages of the world, arguing along with Fishman (1991; 2001) and others that the disappearance of any language constitutes an irreparable loss of global linguistic treasures. They particularly defend the fundamental linguistic rights of all citizens of the world to be educated and to have access to other public services in their own language (Skutnabb-Kangas and Phillipson 1994; Skutnabb-Kangas 2000). At the other end of the continuum we find the debate on the worldwide spread of English: for the first time in the history of humankind one single language has been globalised not only among an international elite, but on a massive basis, posing a threat to many other languages' space. The danger represented by the expansion of English is, however, indirect for the languages at risk of extinction in other latitudes, except for those found in Anglophone countries, due to a general reordering of the complex linguistic mosaic in many countries and regions.";;21;0;;;;undefined;

The tubes were of 0.019 m diameter but different longitudes. An electric resistance was wrapped around the tube to provide the flow of heat. The temperature measurement was done with type K thermocouples. A constant load tank provides the necessary pressure for the fluid to flow at constant rate.

The case of Mexico is used to illustrate the limitations its use imposes on understanding the constellation of components explaining the epidemiological profile, and the problems involved in designing a public health policy on the basis of this sort of misinterpretation. It is suggested that the illusory certainty of a pre-determined destiny distorts the prospective that would enable to construct scenarios; what is actually happening remains hidden by the model and health policies are designed without adequate parameters for evaluating their effective impact. We conclude with some remarks on the usefulness of constructing alternative forms of interpretation for understanding changes in the epidemiological profile, one of the most important inputs for designing better policies to face the challenges posed by health care and dealing with illness in modern-day societies. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The study highlights the importance of the documents, transcribed and published for the first time, in order to make and in-depth analysis concerning the history of medicine and public health of the old regime. Similarly, it seeks to show the relevance of such materials in the historical approach to medical practice and knowledge of the late sixteenth century. The heritage and beliefs about the benefits and ways of using water and the particular and peculiar relationships of indigenous peoples with this natural element and the physical spaces where the baths were performed are discussed. Moreover, it shows how the healing value of these methods was reevaluated by seventeenth-century western medicine.;;5;0;;;;undefined;

However, within the environmental ordinance plans that have been developed in Mexico, the cultural aspects and the indigenous community's rights within their territory, have remained marginalized.

Algorithms have been developed using either a specific criterion to choose the waveforms occurring in the representation from a fixed dictionary, or to construct them as part of the method. In the case of speech signals, most approaches do not take into consideration the important temporal correlations that exist; these are known to be well approximated using linear models. Incorporating this type of a priori knowledge of the signal can facilitate the search for a suitable solution and also help with the interpretation of the representation found. In the present paper a method is proposed for obtaining a sparse representation using a generative parametric model. An example, using speech signals, is given reporting the method's efficacy for different coding costs and sparsity measures.";;2;0;;;;undefined;

As they did so, they had to concern themselves with the sensitivities and political convictions of priests, whose actions might tip a fragile political equilibrium one way or the other by granting personal sanction and hypothetically religious validation to contingent political movements. © 2001 Regents of the University of California.

This is followed by an exposition and critical analysis of the quantitative methods used in each of the above fields. The principal themes discussed with respect to this topic in recent years are synthesized, evaluating the future perspectives of each contribution. The conclusion is that quantitative methods are a valuable support, and one that is not always taken into account in public policy analysis, but only when the set of suppositions that underlie each method, as well as its limitations are understood. These should be complemented with qualitative studies that allow for an adequate integration of technical and political rationalities.;Public policy | Quantitative methods | Teaching process;0;0;;;;undefined;

Both authors observe that there is considerable disparity between the objectives and methods used by scientists and government and inter-government institutions on the one hand, and those of local populations on the other. Under these conditions, they propose that scientists adopt a more critical attitude with respect to the approach and methods they use. They recommend that greater consideration be given to the legitimate rights of local populations concerning subsistence, autonomy and management of their natural environment.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Or will it find new forms of organization and struggle that involve both genuine democratic unions and participation in the broader movement of the class? The heterogeneity of the working class and of its experiences in the restructuring process create varying potentials for self-organization and combativeness. The rival projects interact with the discontents and initiatives from below to produce a complex and dynamic situation. There is a battle under way over the future of the working class. The outcome of this struggle will determine the future of the worker's movement, and the future of Mexico, in turn, will be significantly shaped by the emergence or nonemergence of the working class as a major actor.;;7;0;;;;undefined;

In order to do so, popular groups joined forces with students and professionals. They sought to demonstrate new models of urban and peri-urban development that met their inhabitants' needs while avoiding the chaotic informal processes by which most low-income settlements develop. They also sought to ensure good natural resource management and the protection of their rich and diverse cultural heritage. Last but not least, they searched for new approaches to community-based organizational replication in harmony with the environment. This paper describes the many projects implemented in San Miguel Teotongo, Cananea and Sierra Nevada which included new schools, health centres and community museums, settlement lay-outs with planned and installed infrastructure, markets, the protection of green areas and historic sites and the development of new agricultural products and eco-tourism. It also included community-based mapping of municipalities to allow better management of natural resources. The paper also describes how these initiatives have developed over the last 20 years and their role within Mexico's complex political changes, including their relations with different political parties.;;20;0;;;;undefined;

The author feels that therein resides the essential difference with the North American multi-culture, characterized by separatism, which illustrates by a number of trans-cultural artistic productions. He then concludes by noting that these processes are still affected by situations of inequality (between nations and social categories) and that the traditions they place in interaction are still threatened by equalization processes leading to forms of « abstract reconciliations ».;Hybridization | Multi-culturalism | Social strategies | Trans-culturalization;2;0;;;;undefined;

This decentralization strategy was at the core of an overall educational reform that began in late 1980s. The central government had strong motives to decentralize the educational institution because the highly centralized system was notoriously rigid, inefficient, conflict laden, unresponsive to the needs of local schools, unable to improve the quality of education, and frequently dominated by the National Teachers' Union. The decentralization reform generated important institutional change in the states, some power shifts, and planted the seeds of a new organizational model for school management. © MCB University Press.;Conflict | Decentralization | Education | Institutional analysis | Politics;31;0;;;;undefined;

Although all the countries studied experienced significant restructuring in response to public debt pressures, there were major differences across countries in the magnitude, pace, form, and the manner in which restructuring decisions were made. These differences reflect the state of economic development and institutional characteristics, e.g., the role of the state and the industrial relations system. In developing countries, international lending institutions played a major role in transforming the role of the state. In developed countries, the inherent stability of the economic systems and institutional pressures led to a gradualist approach to restructuring.;;5;0;;;;undefined;

On the other hand, male hamsters display a peculiar copulatory pattern known as Long Intromission (LI) after being exposed to repeated mating. In this study, the characteristics of the temporal recovery of sexual behaviour after a sexual satiety test and the possible relationship between the presence of LI and the inhibition of sexual behaviour were analysed. Fifty males were exposed to repeated mating until they reached a criterion for sexual satiety. Thereafter, they were divided in several groups and retested for sexual activity after a period of 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. During the sexual satiety test LI appeared after nine ejaculatory series, with a mean latency of 18 min. Twenty-four hours after the satiety test, all the subjects (Ss) displayed copulatory activity, and LI appeared after a mean of 2.5 ejaculations with a mean latency of 9.1 min, whereas at 48 h, only 20% of Ss displayed sexual activity. During the 72-h period, the results obtained show a clear trend towards normalisation, and finally, at 96 h, all the sexual parameters were fully restored.

Parametric models of asymmetric adjustment and ARCH-type models necessitate specifying the nature of the non-linear coefficient. If there is little a priori information concerning the actual form of the non-linearity, the estimated model can suffer from a misspecification error. We show that a non-linear time-series can be represented by a deterministic time-dependent coefficient model without first specifying the nature of the non-linearity. The methodology is applied to real GDP and the NYSE Transportation Index. © International Institute of Forecasters.;Asymmetric adjustment | Fourier approximation | Non-linear model;48;0;;;;undefined;

Al alloy obtained by heat treatment. The alloy was prepared, homogenized and thermally treated at three temperatures and at three cooling rates. The obtained microstructures were observed and analyzed by optical microscopy and characterized by hardness and microhardness tests. The structures were composed by dark regions with substructure, embeded in a white matrix. The substructure consisted of fine grained regions, regions of perlitic type or a mixture of both types. Regions without structure when cooled by water, air or liquid nitrogen, were also found. Perlitic substructure was found when cooling started at 400 °C using water, air or nitrogen. A metastable phase, not reported yet in the literature, was found when cooling started at 300 °C using liquid nitrogen.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

Jakobson ’s model of linguistic functions can be understood as operating performatively with greater advantages to pragmatic theory than Searle and Vanderveken’s taxonomy of illocutionary acts. Consequently, these three dimensions can also be found in the aesthetic as in other linguistic functions proposed by Jakobson when examined from a pragmatic viewpoint. By detecting the direction of fit and establishing a distinction between conversion and constitution, we may better understand not only the difference between the aesthetic and other functions but a variety of instances besides the artistic in which the aesthetic is displayed. Therefore, pathos can be clearly differentiated from the aesthetic as a dimension that may weigh, together with logos and ethos, upon the aesthetic function of an illocutionary act. © 1999 John Benjamins Publishing Company.;;4;0;;;;undefined;

This paper presents evidence against such a claim. On the one hand, we show that pre-verbal overt subjects pattern with left dislocated DOs and IOs in a wide range of syntactic contexts: ellipsis, extraction of quantifiers and interpretation of preverbal quantifiers. In these same contexts, sentences with a silent subject differ from sentences with overt ones. We conclude that overt pre-verbal subjects are necessarily left dislocated. In order to account for the left dislocated nature of overt subjects, we propose to eliminate AgrS as a functional projection. Instead we take the idea that subject agreement should be considered a clitic (Taraldsen, 1992), and the relation between the agreement and subject to be one of clitic doubling. Evidence in favor of this claim comes from striking parallelisms between standard clitic doubling constructions and agreement-subject constructions. Specifically, both cases pattern similarly in relation to the determination of binding in certain cases of mismatches in person between the doubling DP and the clitic. Since we take agreement to be a clitic that absorbs theta role and case, movement of the doubling DP subject to a preverbal position cannot be driven by agreement or case reasons. Instead, movement of the subject to a pre-verbal position is driven by discourse considerations as is typical in left dislocations. © 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

It highlights how some environmental problems are simply characteristics of large cities while others can only be understood in relation to specific economic, political and geographic factors. It discusses what constrains the cheapest and most effective solutions - for instance the lack of an integrated public transport policy and measures to promote energy and water conservation. The constraints include complex and often deep-rooted political and administrative factors - for instance the lack of funding available to the municipalities which house a large and growing proportion of the low income population and the powerful vested interests which benefit from the lack of an integrated transport policy. The paper also shows up the inaccuracies in much of the general literature when referring to Mexico City - for instance the exaggerations as to its population and size and the assumption that much reduced population growth rates would necessarily bring improved environmental conditions.;;41;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The proposed algorithm, the branch and contract algorithm, relies on the use of a bounds-contraction subproblem that aims at reducing the size of the search region by eliminating portions of the domain in which the objective function takes only values above a known upper bound. The solution of contraction subproblems at selected branch and bound nodes is performed within a finite contraction operation that helps reducing the total number of nodes in the branch and bound solution tree. The use of the proposed algorithm is illustrated with several numerical examples.;Bilinear terms | Bounds contraction | Branch and contract | Concave separable functions | Continuous global optimization | Linear fractional terms;110;0;;;CMU;undefined;Carnegie Mellon University

Recently, we have shown that male sexual performance in rats is readily affected by different stressors, both acutely and chronically applied. However, there are few reports that directly correlate the increase in corticosteroid levels with the behavioral effects of stress. In this study we investigated whether the administration of corticosterone, either acutely or chronically, could reproduce the effects of stress on male sexual behavior in the male rat. Four doses of corticosterone (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg) or the vehicle, were administered during four consecutive days to sexually experienced males. Male sexual behavior was assessed after the first and the fourth injection. After the last test, males were killed and levels of corticosterone and testosterone were measured by HPLC. We observed an increase in corticosterone plasma levels in a dose-dependent manner. None of the sexual behavior parameters, however, was modified. Plasma levels of testosterone were not modified by corticosterone administration. Both steroids were increased in response to sexual activity, though. These data show that, unlike amphibians and female mammals, corticosteroids do not alter sexual behavior in male rats and suggest that the effect of stress on male sexual behavior cannot be explained by increases in corticosterone.;Corticosterone | Sexual behaviour | Stress | Testosterone;42;0;;;CONACYT;400 200 1789P-M9507;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

By 1846 and particularly 1847, the burden of providing ecclesiastical loans to the federal government fell mainly upon the Archbishopric of Mexico.

Mössbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques showed that both samples had the same iron oxidation states as the parameters and relative intensities (%) of the signals from Fe2+ and Fe3+ were similar, although in the green-greyish obsidian a low-spin Fe3+ species was found which was not observed in the green obsidian. X-ray diffraction (radial distribution function) showed that the short-range order due to interatomic distances was the same for both samples; however they differed in the long-range order. Finally, electron microscopy revealed that the two materials differed clearly in their macroscopic structure.

This hormone is a neuromodulator that modifies both neurotransmitter synthesis and release in the Central Nervous System. Phosphorylation of synaptic proteins plays a crucial role in neuronal function. In particular, phosphorylation of synapsin I by calmodulin dependent multiprotein kinase II modulates both vesicle transport and neurotransmitter release at the synaptic cleft. Recently, it has been described that melatonin may modulate protein phosphorylation through inhibition of calmodulin dependent protein kinase II activity. As a first step to elucidate the mechanism involved in melatonin inhibition of neurotransmitter release, in this work we studied the effects of the hormone on hypothalamic synaptosome protein phosphorylation. The results indicate that used synaptosomes in phosphorylation assays were functional since 3H- GABA release and an increase of 50 % in protein phosphorylation were elicited with a high potassium concentration. Melatonin at 1 nM inhibited phosphorylation of 50, 54, 58-60 and 87 Kd protein bands in both basal synaptosomes (30 %) and K C1 depolarized (50 %). The results suggest that melatonin may modulate neurotransmitter release through an inhibition of synaptosomal protein phosphorylation mediated by calmodulin dependent protein kinase II.;Calmodulin | Melatonin | Phosphorylation | Synaptososomes;1;0;;;;undefined;

This has transformed the model of anthropology built on the study of non-European rural populations. It has also enabled anthropologists to make their own particular contributions using ethnography and qualitative research to investigate how cities have been transformed by the emergence of multicultural heterogeneity, hybridization and intercultural and social segregation. A critical review of the main urban theories demonstrates that it is important to consider the cultural dimension of the urban experience in conjunction with the socio-economic aspects. To do so, cities should be categorized not only in terms of socio-spatial but also socio-communicational development, taking into account the role played by the mass media and information technology in the internal integration of cities and their incorporation into transnational networks. Lastly, we discuss how anthropological practice can be restructured to encompass the new forms of racism, exclusion and social disintegration that form part of the picture in a large number of megacities, in both metropolitan and peripheral countries.;;8;0;;;;undefined;

Some of these models attempt to reproduce in animals some of the features of the human depressive pattern. Some other models try to simulate the neurochemical abnormalities underlying in the disease. A third group of animal models pretends to be useful to selectively detect drugs with antidepressive actions. Thus, each animal model proposal for the study of depression must assess its validity in each one of these criteria. In this paper we review the most recent evidences that have been generated supporting the validity of the Flinders rats as an important animal model of depression. The Flinders Sensitive Line of rats was originated in Australia, selectively reproducing rats from the Sprague-Dawley strain that displayed hypersensitivity to cholinergic stimulation, as well as alterations in certain behavioral patterns that resemble those observed in human depressive patterns. These characteristics were reproduced in the subsequent generations thus starting a special colony and a large series of different kinds of studies that have confirmed and extended the original observations. The face validity in the Flinders rats is mainly based on the fact that they present a clearly diminished frequency of the presentation of pleasure seeking behavioral patterns, this has been interpreted as anhedonia, which is one the major characteristics of human depression. Other features are alterations of motor behavior, body weight, a reduction of the REM sleep latency and an increase of its duration, exaggerated response to some stressors and alterations on the execution of different behavioral tests made in the laboratory, these being indicative of a mood alteration. Regarding the construct validity, the evidences that have been obtained up to date are confronted with at least two hypothesis of the origin of depression: the cholinergic hypothesis and the serotonergic hypothesis. Both theories are congruent with the exaggerated responses observed after the selective stimulation of each one of these systems, particularly of the muscarinic receptors in the cholinergic system and the 5-HT1 a receptors in the serotonergic system. Regarding the capacity of this model to respond to the treatment with antidepressive drugs, the existing evidences suggest that some of the abnormalities these rats present are drastically reduced or totally normalized after chronic treatment with classic tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine and more specific antidepressants of the noradrenergic and serotoninergic systems, such as desimipramine and sertraline, respectively. The balance that is presented indicates that the Flinders rats are a model that recognizes the genetic component of depression; that reproduces some of its central characteristics; that presents cholinergic and serotonergic system alterations and that responds by normalizing its alterations to antidepressive treatment. Therefore, an exhaustive study of this model appears as a very relevant possibility to gain deeper knowledge about the cerebral phenomena that come with this illness, as well as an increase of the possibilities to generate new therapeutic alternatives.";animal model | depression | Flinders rats;0;0;;;;undefined;

It will show in which ways these processes affect linguistic human rights in two key areas of social organization: bilingual education and the administration of justice. This broad sociolinguistic perspective will allow the author to relate the Mexican experience to other cases, and to draft a list of minimal criteria for the evaluation and defence of linguistic human rights. As a conclusion the article maintains that a sociolinguistic framework that broadens the concepts of language and communication underlying existing models for language planning will be best suited to describe language conflict situations, and to establish an adequate basis for the definition and implementation of linguistic human rights. Such a framework will have to take into account at least three levels of sociolinguistic analysis: (1) linguistic structure, (2) discourse structure, and (3) cultural models. © Walter de Gruyter.;;23;0;;;;undefined;

Nevertheless, poverty and social unrest keep growing. The objective of this article is to explain this apparent paradox. First there is an analysis of the relationship between structural adjustment, the growth of poverty, and the reorientation of broad social policy away from social rights towards selective and targeted poor relief. In order to illustrate the content and operation of a typical Latin American poverty program, the Mexican National Solidarity Program is examined. The initial question posed is whether this program alleviates poverty and grants a social minimum for the poor in view of the magnitude of poverty, the quantity of resources and their allocation. Next the participatory approach of the program is analyzed in relation to the empowerment of poor groups and communities. Finally, there is a reflection on the place of social work in this program and how the role of the social worker has been transformed.;Latin America | Poverty | Social welfare | Social work;0;0;;;;undefined;

In this study, four different stressors were prenatally applied to rats. Pregnant rats were subjected to immobilization, unavoidable electric foot shocks, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMd), or immersion in cold water. During adulthood, male offspring were tested for masculine and feminine sexual behavior. The results corroborated the fact that immobilization induced an impairment of masculine sexual behavior and a facilitation of feminine sexual behavior. Electric shocks showed only minor differences in masculine behavior when compared to intact controls, and no signs of lordosis behavior were observed. The REMd group displayed a major impairment of masculine behavior, even greater than that observed within the immobilization group. However, lordosis behavior was only induced with estradiol. On the other hand, water immersion seems to have a facilitatory effect on several parameters of masculine behavior and did not show lordosis behavior even with hormonal treatment. These results strongly suggest that changes in sex behavior induced by prenatal stress are linked to the nature of the stressor. © 1993.;Foot shocks | Immobilization | Prenatal stress | REM deprivation | Sexual behavior | Water immersion;49;0;;;;undefined;

The exponential growth in new non-Roman Catholic religious movements since the 1950s and the breadth of their organized networks have stimulated research based more often on sensationalism than on a scientific perspective. The complex and pluralistic manifestations of this heterodox religious phenomenon have generally been reduced to a notion of Protestantism rarely found in scholarly usage. The multiplicity of non-Roman Catholic religious movements cannot be reduced to some catchall category of Protestantism. Moreover, one must also analyze the connection between usage of the term Protestant and a culture marked by the Spanish Inquisition, which shaped the Ibero-American collective unconscious for more than three centuries, in order to understand why a fair number of Latin American researchers look at religious dissidence rather superficially, reducing it immediately to Protestantism.;;62;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;TF;undefined;Tinker Foundation

A consequential related problem is to estimate the size of important subpopulations. A random sample of a population is asked whether they know anyone in a given subpopulation of size e, thus yielding an estimate of the probability that this occurs in the population. Using an equal likelihood probability model, this leads to a lower bound estimate for c, the average number of people a person in the population knows. When the number of people a person knows has a binomial distribution over the population this value is an estimate for c itself. Here we test this method on data from Mexico City, where a large random sample of people was asked whether they knew anyone in each of several different subpopulations in Mexico City of known and unknown sizes. We develop procedures for obtaining various bounds and estimates for c and determine some of the respondents' attributes on which variation in probability of knowing someone in a subpopulation and variation in personal network size seem to depend. We apply these to the estimation of e for rape victims in Mexico City and the estimation of c from data on AIDS victims in the United States. © 1991.;;64;0;;;NSF;BNS-8318132;National Science Foundation

These effects were obtained, however, only in doses that also impaired motor execution. The purpose of the present study was to establish whether copulatory thrusting patterns were affected by these GABA transaminase inhibitors. Sodium valproate, 200 mg/kg, reduced the number of intromissions and the intromission rate without affecting mounting behavior. GAG, 100 mg/kg, had similar effects on sexual behavior. The only effect obtained on copulatory thrusting patterns was a small reduction in mount and intromission thrust frequency after GAG 100 mg/kg. It is unlikely that this effect is responsible for the inhibitory actions of GAG on sexual behavior, especially since sodium valproate did not modify copulatory thrusting patterns, but inhibited sexual behavior in a manner similar to that of GAG. © 1990.;Copulatory thrusting patterns | GABA transaminase inhibitors | Sexual behavior;13;0;;;;PCSABNA 030859;

In spite of that, on the basis of the democratic mode of operation of the co-operatives and the EPP, and on the incipient process of technical education (bodily exercise, mental instruction and technological training) combined with paid productive labour, it seems that at Mondragón's EPP a significant step is being taken towards an effective process of appropriation of knowledge. In this framework, students of the EPP, members of Alecoop, are creating the necessary conditions to become fully developed individuals. © 1982 Unesco.;;3;0;;;;undefined;

Paralysis victims lose the feedback of this receptor and cannot initiate motor responses. Four hemiplegic patients were trained to use auditory feedback from electromyographic recordings to initiate activity in paretic limbs. With the addition of visual feedback and the use of the auditory signal as a reinforcing stimulus, the patients' muscle activity was then shaped to approximate normal movement. © 1981.;Biofeedback | Electromyography | Hemiplegia;0;0;;;;undefined;
