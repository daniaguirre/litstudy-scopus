Numerous anthropometric-based predictive equations are available for body composition assessments; furthermore, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) estimates are available. However, in older adults, the validity of body fat estimates requires further investigation. Objective: To assess the agreement between percentage body fat (BF%) estimates by BIA and five predictive equations based on anthropometric characteristics using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference method. A secondary objective was to identify whether excluding short-stature women improves the agreement of BF% estimates in a group of community-dwelling, older Mexican women. Methods: A concordance analysis of BF% was performed. A total of 121 older women participated in the study. Anthropometric information, BIA, and DXA body composition estimates were obtained. Five equations using anthropometric data were evaluated in order to determine body fat percentage (BF%) using DXA as reference method. Paired t-test comparisons and standard error of estimates (SEE) were obtained. The Bland-Altman plot with 95% limits of agreement and the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) were used to evaluate the BF% prediction equations and BIA estimates. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 73.7 (±5.8) years old. BIA and the anthropometric based equations examined showed mean significant differences when tested in the entire sample. For the taller women (height > 145 cm), no significant difference in the paired comparison was found between DXA and BIA of BF% estimates. The mean BF% was 40.3 (±4.8) and 40.7 (±6.2) for DXA and BIA, respectively. The concordance between methods was good (CCC 0.814), (SEE 2.62). Also, in the taller women subset, the Woolcott equation using waist-to-height ratio presented no significant difference in the paired comparison; however, the error of the estimates was high (SEE 3.37) and the concordance was moderate (CCC 0.693). Conclusion: This study found that BIA yielded good results in the estimation of BF% among women with heights over 145 cm. Also, in this group, the Woolcott predictive equation based on waist circumference and height ratio showed no significant differences compared to DXA in the paired comparison; however, the large error of estimates observed may limit its application. In older women, short stature may impact the validity of the body fat percentage estimates of anthropometric-based predictive equations.";aging | anthropometric | bioelectrical impedance | body fat | DXA (dual X-ray absorptiometry) | validation studies;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

The effect of the initial pH of cow manure and the fermentation time of the AD on the microbial composition, VFAs, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) production was evaluated. The cow manure (7% solids) was adjusted to initial pH values of 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5, and the AD products were analyzed every four days until day 20. The initial pH and the fermentation time had an important effect on the production of metabolites. During AD, only the hydrolytic and acidogenic stages were identified, and the bacteria found were from the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Spirochaetes. The most abundant genera produced in the four AD were Caproiciproducens, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Romboutsia, Paeniclostridium, Turicibacter, Peptostreptococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Fonticella. The highest amount of VFAs was obtained at pH 8.5, and the production of the acids was butyric > acetic > propionic. The maximum production of GA3 and IAA was at an initial pH of 6.5 on day 20 and a pH of 5.5 on day 4, respectively. There was a strong correlation (> 0.8) between the most abundant microorganisms and the production of VFAs and GA3.

Infrared thermography is a non-invasive tool that uses the radiation emitted from the skin of animals to assess their thermal state. However, there are no established thermal windows in wildlife species because factors such as the thickness or color of the skin, type/length of coat, or presence of fur can influence the readings taken to obtain objective, sensitive values. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the usefulness and application of the ocular, nasal, thoracic, abdominal, and podal anatomical regions as thermal windows for evaluating zoo animals’ thermal response and health status. A literature search of the Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed databases was performed to identify relevant studies that used IRT with wild species as a complementary diagnostic tool. Implementing IRT in zoos or conservation centers could also serve as a method for determining and monitoring optimal habitat designs to meet the needs of specific animals. In addition, we analyze the limitations of using IRT with various wildlife species under human care to understand better the differences among animals and the factors that must be considered when using infrared thermography.;infrared thermography | pain | thermal status | thermal window;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In such a competitive industry and considering the complexity of consumer behaviour, improvement and innovation become necessary. Consequently, consumer science, which is responsible for identifying the motivation behind customer preferences through their attitudes, perception and behaviour, has implemented strategies ranging from simple hedonic measurements to several innovative and emerging methodologies for a deeper understanding of the variables that affect the product experience: sensory, affective and cognitive. In this context, we offer a review inspired by previous research that explores some of the quantitative and qualitative methods used in consumer studies related to beer consumption, ranging from traditional approaches (acceptability, purchase intention, preference, etc.) to techniques that go beyond acceptability and allow a different understanding of aspects of consumer perception and behaviour (segmentation, expectations, emotions, representation, etc.). Also, innovative applications (contexts, immersive technologies and virtual reality, implicit measures, etc.) and current trends related to consumer science (Internet, social media, pairing, product experience, etc.) are addressed.";beer | beyond acceptability | consumer studies | new technologies | perception | product experience | qualitative studies | quantitative studies | representation;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

The heat interchange through the superficial temperature of animals can be evaluated with infrared thermography (IRT). However, to date, there is no information on thermal windows in puppies. This study aimed to evaluate, with the use of IRT, the microcirculatory alterations in 8 different thermal windows identified at 7 different times in 289 newborn puppies assigned to different groups. Three thermograms were taken from four zones of each puppy: the facial, frontal, right lateral, and left lateral regions. Newborn puppies were grouped in 4 quartiles according to their weight: Q1 (126–226 g) n = 73, Q2 (227–330 g) n = 72, Q3 (331–387 g) n = 74, and Q4 (388–452 g) n = 70. A total of 8 thermal windows were considered at 7 evaluation times from Wet at birth until 24 h after birth (AB). Two-way mixed ANOVA within and between subjects’ design for each thermal window (eight models) was performed. Results revealed a positive correlation between the puppy’s weight and its ability to achieve thermostability in all the evaluated thermal windows. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.0001) between the 4 quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) were found. The lowest temperatures were recorded when the pups were still wet and the highest at 24 h AB. Thermal windows with the highest temperatures were abdominal (34.234 ± 0.056 °C), thoracic (33.705 ± 0.049 °C), nasal (30.671 ± 0.110 °C), and upper left palpebral (34.066 ± 0.052 °C), while the lowest were thoracic limb brachial biceps (27.534 ± 0.051 °C), thoracic limb elbow (27.141 ± 0.049 °C), thoracic limb metacarpal (27.024 ± 0.062 °C), and femoral pelvic limb (27.654 ± 0.055 °C).

Toxoplasma gondii is one of the pathogenic infections associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown an association between high levels of IgG anti-T. gondii from mothers and their neonates, with a higher risk of developing schizophrenia. The absence of the parasite and the levels of IgGs found in the early stages of life suggest a transplacental transfer of the anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies, which could bind fetal brain structures by molecular mimicry and induce alterations in neurodevelopment. This study aimed to determine the maternal pathogenic antibodies formation that led to behavioral impairment on the progeny of rats immunized with T. gondii. Female rats were immunized prior to gestation with T. gondii lysate (3 times/once per week). The anti-T. gondii IgG levels were determined in the serum of pregestational exposed females’ previous mating. After this, locomotor activity, cognitive and social tests were performed. Cortical neurotransmitter levels for dopamine and glutamate were evaluated at 60 PND in the progeny of rats immunized before gestation (Pregestational group). The maternal pathogenic antibodies were evidenced by their binding to fetal brain mimotopes in the Pregestational group and the reactivity of the serum containing anti-T. gondii IgG was tested in control fetal brains (non-immunized). These results showed that the Pregestational group presented impairment in short and long-term memory, hypoactivity and alteration in social behavior, which was also associated with a decrease in cortical glutamate and dopamine levels. We also found the IgG antibodies bound to brain mimotopes in fetuses from females immunized with T. gondii, as well as observing a strong reactivity of the serum females immunized for fetal brain structures of fetuses from unimmunized mothers. Our results suggest that the exposure to T. gondii before gestation produced maternal pathogenic antibodies that can recognize fetal brain mimotopes and lead to neurochemical and behavioral alterations in the offspring.;cognitive impairment | molecular mimicry | schizophrenia | social alterations | T. gondii;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;320520;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Grapefruit consumption involves a large amount of waste that goes to landfills and produces significant pollution affecting the human health. To examine this phenomenon, we designed an efficient chemical method that recovers naringin-rich flavonoid extracts from the fresh waste of grapefruits, by using the solvent impregnation resin method (SIR) with XAD-4 amberlite and either methanol or water as elution systems. Additionally, we focused on evaluating these extracts’ anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in behavioral predictive paradigms in mice. According to direct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by NMR, and Direct Injection Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (DIESI-MS), methanol extracts obtained after resin treatment were free of coumarin compounds and evinced had a high content of naringin.

Naringin-rich methanol extract caused a clear anxiolytic-like effect in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and the Hole-Board (HBT) Tests, increasing oral doses of this extract did not produce a sedative effect. A single oral dose caused an antidepressant-like effect in the Tail Suspension Test (TST), while repeated administrations of the methanol extract elicited a robust antidepressant effect in the Forced Swimming Test (FST) in mice.

This condition has been described in animal species such as canids, sheep, cattle, horses, pigs, and marine mammals. In its pathogenesis, the pulmonary epithelium activates a limited inflammatory response initiated by cytokines causing leukocyte chemotaxis, inhibition of phagocytosis, and pathogen destruction. Likewise, cytokines release participates in the apoptosis processes of pneumocytes due to the interaction of angiotensin with cytokines and the caspase pathway. Due to these reactions, the prevalent signs are lung injury, hypoxia, acidosis, and pneumonia with susceptibility to infection. Given the importance of the pathophysiological mechanism of meconium aspiration syndrome, this review aims to discuss the relevance of the syndrome in veterinary medicine. The inflammatory processes caused by meconium aspiration in animal models will be analyzed, and the cellular apoptosis and biochemical processes of pulmonary surfactant inactivation will be discussed.;animal models | apoptosis | meconium | pulmonary inflammatory response | surfactant inactivation;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The said characteristics also create a risk for the extinction of the species, thus, the urgent necessity to stablish propagation strategies to prevent its loss. The objective of this study was to establish a protocol for asymbiotic seed germination and acclimatization of E. cordigera. For asymbiotic germination, different concentrations (¼ and ½ and full-strength) of MS medium were evaluated, adding 0.15% of activated charcoal (AC). MS medium without AC was used as a control treatment. The germination percentage was evaluated after 16 weeks of culture. The treatments used for the germination stage were also used for the development of seedlings which lasted 20 weeks, then plant length, number of roots, root length, number of shoots, and number of leaves per shoot were measured. Finally, the plants obtained were acclimatized. The ½-strength MS + 0.15% AC resulted in 100% seed germination, while ¼-strength MS + 0.15% AC yielded longer seedlings (1.53 cm long). As for the number and length of roots, MS + 0.15% AC proved to be the best medium, with 2 roots and 2 cm respectively. No significant differences between culture media were found for the number of shoots and number of leaves per shoot. The plants obtained were transferred to an acclimatization process for eight weeks in the greenhouse, 209 plants (97% survival rate) were obtained during the acclimatization process. The presented protocols will contribute to the propagation and conservation of E. cordigera, an orchid species with ornamental and economic importance.;Activated charcoal | Asymbiotic germination | Mexican native orchid | Micropropagation;0;0;;;;undefined;

It also explored risk factors such as season, breed, age and sex in the states of Puebla and Veracruz, Mexico. A total of 5281 cattle livers were inspected in two abattoirs. The overall prevalence of the parasite in cattle throughout 2020 was 24.9% (1313 out of 5281). The highest prevalence was found in Veracruz (28.5%; tropical climate), followed by Puebla (18.4%; temperate climate). The prevalence of fluke infection during the wet season was 19.0% and 25.8% in the states of Puebla and Veracruz, respectively; during the dry season, this was 18.0% and 30.2% respectively. The annual loss caused by condemnation of the liver for both abattoirs was estimated to be US$7502. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, two models were constructed for potential association with the prevalence of condemned livers, using season, breed, age and sex as risk factors. The results indicate that season, age and sex were signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of parasitic infection. Cattle age was the variable most strongly associated with F. hepatica infection, with the highest prevalence in cattle over three years of age as compared to younger animals, both in the states of Veracruz with a tropical climate (OR 6.443; 95% CI: 4.487–9.251) and in Puebla with a temperate climate (OR 2.854; 95% CI: 1.531–5.321). The results indicate that diﬀerent factors were signiﬁcantly associated with the prevalence of condemned livers, and it highlights the importance of continuous monitoring programmes for F. hepatica infection and preventing economic losses in cattle production.";Abattoirs | Cattle | Economic loss | Fasciola hepatica | Liver condemnation | Prevalence;0;0;;;BUAP;VIEP-VIMA-NAT-21-I;Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla

However, skeleton formation is the result of the growth of thousands of polyps depositing millimeter-sized CaCO3 structures, called corallites. Nevertheless, the orientation of the corallite trajectories and their position with respect to the colony could be altering the information obtained from the skeleton. In this sense, to obtain reliable information from coral skeletons, it is necessary to understand how polyp population growth influences coral growth rates. For this reason, we present a study that combines computed tomography image segmentation, optical densitometry, and demographic equations to follow the trajectory of corallites in order to model coral growth from the replication of its corallites and understand the responses in terms of their growth. We observed that both corallite replication and skeletal growth characteristics vary significantly according to the position they occupy within the colony. The central zone of the colony promotes corallite replication, and it is in this zone that we measured the highest values of extension and calcification. These variations in vegetative and skeletal growth are possibly in accordance with the variability of available resources and environmental stimuli in different zones of the skeleton. This approach will allow us to explore future lines of research associated with the size limits of different coral species and to observe how different drivers modulate polyp budding.;;0;1;;;;undefined;

A reduction in glucose import capacity can have a positive effect on production strain performance, however, this is not always the case. In this study, E. coli W3110 and a group of four isogenic derivative strains, harboring single or multiple deletions of genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS)-dependent transporters as well as non-PTS transporters were characterized by determining their transcriptomic response to reduced glucose import capacity. Results: These strains were grown in bioreactors with M9 mineral salts medium containing 20 g/L of glucose, where they displayed specific growth rates ranging from 0.67 to 0.27 h−1, and specific glucose consumption rates (qs) ranging from 1.78 to 0.37 g/g h. RNA-seq analysis revealed a transcriptional response consistent with carbon source limitation among all the mutant strains, involving functions related to transport and metabolism of alternate carbon sources and characterized by a decrease in genes encoding glycolytic enzymes and an increase in gluconeogenic functions. A total of 107 and 185 genes displayed positive and negative correlations with qs, respectively. Functions displaying positive correlation included energy generation, amino acid biosynthesis, and sugar import. Conclusion: Changes in gene expression of E. coli strains with impaired glucose import capacity could be correlated with qs values and this allowed an inference of the physiological state of each mutant. In strains with lower qs values, a gene expression pattern is consistent with energy limitation and entry into the stationary phase. This physiological state could explain why these strains display a lower capacity to produce recombinant protein, even when they show very low rates of acetate production. The comparison of the transcriptomes of the engineered strains employed as microbial factories is an effective approach for identifying favorable phenotypes with the potential to improve the synthesis of biotechnological products.;Glucose transport | Mutant | Physiology | RNA-seq | Transcriptome;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;A1-S-8646;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Most of the GHG in the atmosphere comes from carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The main objective of this research is to investigate direct and indirect GHG emission in five different agroecosystems, contrasted by tillage agricultural, farm practices (oat and maize-fava and vetch).CO2, N2O y CH4 concentrations were measured using two closed static chambers. Total biomass and production costs were determined. Indirect emissions were calculated from fuel used in producing and packing of synthetic fertilizers and herbicide, and sheep manure mineralization. The results showed that CO2 was the gas that most contributes to GHG emissions followed by the CH4 and NO2. The agrosystem with reduce tillage and synthetic inputs had the highest emissions (979 CO2 eq kg ha−1). Agrosystems using synthetic inputs (conventional and reduce tillage) showed higher indirect emissions (958 and 856 CO2 eq kg ha−1 respectively). Maize in monoculture produced more than the systems with rotation or intercropping. Reduced tillage with intercropping and organic inputs was the most expensive to produce but had the least gas emission per dollar invested and per kilogram of biomass produced while conventional tillage agrosystems with organic or synthetic inputs stored little carbon in the soil, produced less biomass per unit area and presented higher CO2 eq emissions per unit of biomass.;Cost balance gases | Intercropping | Organic inputs | Reduced tillage | Synthetic fertilizers | Temperate sub-humid zone;1;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Nevertheless, most of the early-stage cell and process development is carried out in batch cultures, which can bias the initial selection of expression systems. Cell engineering can provide an alternative to fed-batch cultures for high-throughput screening and host selection. We have previously reported a library of Escherichia coli strains with single and multiple deletions of genes involved in glucose transport. Compared to their wild type (W3110), the mutant strains displayed lower glucose uptake, growth and aerobic acetate production rates. Therefore, when cultured in batch mode, such mutants may perform similar to W3110 cultured in fed-batch mode. To test that hypothesis, we evaluated the constitutive expression of the green fluorescence protein (GFP) in batch cultures in microbioreactors using a semi defined medium supplemented with 10 or 20 g/L glucose + 0.4 g yeast extract/g glucose. Results: The mutant strains cultured in batch mode displayed a fast-growth phase (growth rate between 0.40 and 0.60 h−1) followed by a slow-growth phase (growth rate between 0.05 and 0.15 h−1), similar to typical fed-batch cultures. The phase of slow growth is most probably caused by depletion of key amino acids. Three mutants attained the highest GFP fluorescence. Particularly, a mutant named WHIC (ΔptsHIcrr, ΔmglABC), reached a GFP fluorescence up to 14-fold greater than that of W3110. Strain WHIC was cultured in 2 L bioreactors in batch mode with 100 g/L glucose + 50 g/L yeast extract. These cultures were compared with exponentially fed-batch cultures of W3110 maintaining the same slow-growth of WHIC (0.05 h−1) and using the same total amount of glucose and yeast extract than in WHIC cultures. The WHIC strain produced approx. 450 mg/L GFP, while W3110 only 220 mg/L. Conclusion: The combination of cell engineering and high throughput screening allowed the selection of a particular mutant that mimics fed-batch behavior in batch cultures. Moreover, the amount of GFP produced by the strain WHIC was substantially higher than that of W3110 under both, batch and fed-batch schemes. Therefore, our results represent a valuable technology for accelerated bioprocess development.;Cell engineering | Fed-batch | Glucose transport | High cell-density | Overflow metabolism;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;A1-S-8646;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Three experimental treatments were evaluated in a conventional tilapia culture (control), Biofloc culture (BFT), and Biofloc with the addition of the live yeast R. glutinis 1×106 CFU g-1 (BFT+Rg), with four replicates per treatment. In all cases, commercial food was supplied to the organisms (32% protein and 5% lipids). O. niloticus juveniles (7.02 ± 0.04 g) were randomly distributed in 12 tanks, each with 15 animals. BFT+Rg treatment showed a significant increase in weight gain compared with the other treatments. Significant improvements were found in Fulton's condition factor, feed conversion rate, and hepatosomatic index under Biofloc conditions, BFT, and BFT+Rg treatments. No significant differences were observed in survival. R. glutinis directly influenced gene expression in the liver and intestine. The expression of tnfa, tgfb, hsp70, and gpx, genes in the liver significantly increased in the BFT+Rg treatment compared with the other treatments. Similarly, a significant increase was found in intestinal il1b, tnfa, tgfb, trf, hsp70 gpx, and cat expression patterns in the BFT+Rg treatment.

However, there is a lack of evidence showing persistence of abnormal frontostriatal FC and its relation to cognitive flexibility performance in patients with clinically manifest HD. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the resting-state FC integrity of the frontostriatal circuit and its relation to cognitive flexibility in HD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Method: Eighteen patients with early clinical HD manifestation and 18 HCs matched for age, sex, and education participated in this study. Both groups performed the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Intra-Extra Dimensional (IED) set-shift task, which measures cognitive flexibility. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were also acquired to examine the FC in specific frontostriatal circuits. Eight regions of interest were preselected based on regions previously associated with extradimensional (ED) shifting in patients with premanifest HD. Results: Significant negative correlations between the number of attentional set-shifting errors and the ventral striatum-ventrolateral PFC FC were found in the HD group. This group also showed negative FC correlations between the total errors and the FC between right ventral striatum-right ventrolateral PFC, left ventral striatum-left ventrolateral PFC, and right ventral striatum-left ventrolateral PFC. Negative correlations between the ED errors and left ventral striatum-left ventrolateral PFC and right ventral striatum-right ventrolateral PFC FC were also found. Finally, a positive correlation between the number of stages completed and left ventral striatum-left ventrolateral PFC FC was found. Conclusions: Manifest HD patients show significant cognitive flexibility deficits in attentional set-shifting that are associated with FC alterations in the frontostriatal circuit. These results show that FC abnormalities found in the prodromal stage of the disease can also be associated with cognitive flexibility deficits at a later clinical stage, making them good candidates to be explored in longitudinal studies.;Cognitive flexibility | Frontostriatal circuit | Functional connectivity | Intra-Extra Dimensional shift learning | Resting-state functional magnetic resonance image;0;0;;;CONACYT;A1-S-10669;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We tested whether bee body position promoted the attraction and/or antagonistic behavior of con- and hetero-specific bees that interacted on prickly pear flowers of Opuntia huajuapensis. To test this, we placed dummy model bees of Apis mellifera and the native Lithurgus littoralis in flowers in three common body positions: alert, feeding, and horizontal. The results showed that dummy model bees in feeding and horizontal body positions attracted A. mellifera bees, while the alert position attracted native male L. littoralis. Male L. littoralis bees spent more time attacking model bees in horizontal and alert positions. The position of dummy bees also influenced response times. Bees of A. mellifera responded fastest to L. littoralis in the alert and horizontal position, male L. littoralis responded fastest to con-specific bees in the alert and feeding position, and female L. littoralis responded fastest to A. mellifera bees in the feeding position.

This behavior is mainly triggered by hormone concentration changes and their interactions with their respective receptors in the brain, particularly oxytocin. These chemical signals also influence mother–young bonding, a critical process for neonatal survival that develops during the first postpartum hours. Currently, dairy buffalo behavior during parturition has rarely been studied. For this reason, this review aims to analyze the existing scientific evidence regarding maternal behavior in water buffalo during calving. It will address the mechanisms of imprinting, maternal care, and allosuckling strategies that may influence the survival and health of calves.;allosuckling | imprinting | maternal behavior | nursing | offspring | water buffalo;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

This work aims to make a biochemical and genomic characterization of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum JCLA3. By multilocus analysis, the species of B. pseudocatenulatum JCLA3 was established as pseudocatenulatum. It contains one circular genome of 2,369,863 bp with G + C content of 56.6%, no plasmids, 1937 CDSs, 54 tRNAs, 16 rRNAs, 1 tmRNA, 1 CRISPR region, and 401 operons predicted, including a CRISPR-Cas operon; it encodes an extensive number of enzymes, which allows it to utilize different carbohydrates. The ack gene was found as part of an operon formed by xfp and pta genes. Two genes of ldh were found at different positions. Chromosomally encoded resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin, non-hemolytic activity, and moderate inhibition of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 were demonstrated by B. pseudocatenulatum JCLA3; it can survive 100% in simulated saliva, can tolerate primary and secondary glyco- or tauro-conjugated bile salts but not in a mix of bile; the strain did not survive at pH 1.5–5. The cbh gene coding to choloylglycine hydrolase was identified in its genome, which could be related to the ability to deconjugate secondary bile salts. Intact cells showed twice as much antioxidant activity than debris. B. pseudocatenulatum JCLA3 showed 49% of adhesion to Caco-2 cells.

LMNA encodes lamin AC, which interacts with the lamin-associated protein 2 alpha (LAP2α) encoded by the TMPO gene. The LAP2α/Arg690Cys polymorphism is frequent in Latin America and was previously found to disrupt LAP2α-Lamin AC interactions in vitro. We identified a DCM patient heterozygous for both a lamin AC truncating mutation (Ser431*) and the LAP2α/Arg690Cys polymorphism. We performed protein modeling and docking experiments, and used confocal microscopy to compare leukocyte nuclear morphology among family members with different genotype combinations (wild type, LAP2α Arg690Cys heterozygous, lamin AC/Ser431* heterozygous, and LAP2α Arg690Cys/lamin AC Ser431* double heterozygous). Protein modeling predicted that 690Cys destabilizes the LAP2α homodimer and impairs lamin AC-LAP2α docking. Lamin AC-deficient nuclei (Ser431* heterozygous) showed characteristic blebs and invaginations, significantly decreased nuclear area, and increased elongation, while LAP2α/Arg690Cys heterozygous nuclei showed a lower perimeter and higher circularity than wild-type nuclei. LAP2α Arg690Cys apparently attenuated the effect of LMNA Ser431* on the nuclear area and fully compensated for its effect on nuclear circularity. Altogether, the data suggest that LAP2α/Arg690Cys may be one of the many factors contributing to phenotype variation of LMNA-associated DCM.;dilated cardiomyopathy | genetic modifier | lamin AC | LAP2α | nuclear morphology | TMPO Arg690Cys;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;261670;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Historically, PRRs have been associated with pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), whereas NLRs have been involved with effector-triggered immunity (ETI). However, recent studies reveal that such binary distinction is far from being applicable to the real world. Although the perception of plant pathogens and the final mounting response are achieved by different means, central hubs involved in signaling are shared between PTI and ETI, blurring the zig-zag model of plant immunity. In this review, we not only summarize our current understanding of PRR- and NLR-mediated immunities in plants, but also highlight those signaling components that are evolutionarily conserved across the plant kingdom. Altogether, we attempt to offer an overview of how plants mediate and integrate the induction of the defense responses that comprise PTI and ETI, emphasizing the need for more evolutionary molecular plant–microbe interactions (EvoMPMI) studies that will pave the way to a better understanding of the emergence of the core molecular machinery involved in the so-called evolutionary arms race between plants and microbes.;disease | evolution | network | pathogen | plant immunity | receptors | signaling;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;IPN;SIP20221086;Instituto Politécnico Nacional

We assessed GWG and applied several tools, such as a food frequency questionnaire and 24-h recall, to obtain dietary and nutrient intake and eating habits. The birth weight of adolescents’ offspring was registered. Later, we performed crude and adjusted Poisson models. The mean age was 15.8 ± 1.3 years. Of all food groups, the lowest frequency of adequate intake corresponded to vegetables (7%) and legumes (10.2%). Excessive (36.8%) and insufficient (40.9%) GWG were observed. Pregnant adolescents with inadequate legumes intake increased the probability of excessive GWG: (PR 1.86 95% CI 1.00–3.44).

The purpose of this work was to investigate the rate and distribution of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with recurrent infections and to distinguish the current efficacy of antibiotics commonly used in eradication therapy at a Mexican institute focused on children. A total of 118 P. aeruginosa isolates from 25 children with CF (2015–2019) underwent molecular identification, antimicrobial sensitivity tests, and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA genotyping (RAPD-PCR). The bacterial isolates were grouped in 84 RAPD profiles, revealing a cross-infection between two sisters, whose resistance profile remained unchanged for more than 2 years. Furthermore, 77.1% (91/118) and 51.7% (61/118) of isolates showed in vitro susceptibility to ceftazidime and amikacin, respectively, antibiotics often used in eradication therapy at our institution. As well, 42.4% (50/118) were categorized as multi-drug resistant (MDR) and 12.7% (15/118) were XDR. Of these resistant isolates, 84.6% (55/65) were identified from patients with recurrent infections. The high frequency of XDR strains in children with CF should be considered a caution mark, as such resistance patterns are more commonly found in adult patients. Additionally, amikacin may soon prove ineffective.

Individuals of Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus (Cactaceae), a specially protected species, store some seeds on the plant over 1 year. We examined the seed retention time, the release mechanism, and the germination behavior of this species in Central Mexico. Flowers produced in a population of A. kotschoubeyanus were monitored, and the number of fruits retained or expelled was determined to calculate the serotiny degree (the number of seeds retained in the tubercules of the plant divided by the total number of seeds produced per plant). The seed retention in previous years was estimated for 30 individuals. The dynamics of retained seeds in the mother plant (seed age in “rings”) were determined from the annual average production of tubercules per individual, using observations for 5 years. A germination test employing the seeds collected from recently formed fruits and those obtained from different rings was conducted. We observed that 86.6% of the plants showed seed retention (aerial seed bank) in some ring of the aerial stems. The serotiny degree was 37.3, having 32.68 seeds per plant. Seeds retained in the “rings” from 1- to 24-year-old plants had a higher germination proportion (between 0.40 and 0.73) than fresh seeds (0.13).

Although cancer therapy has progressed in recent years, current therapeutic approaches are ineffective due to toxicity and chemoresistance.

This review describes the regulation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) expression and the role of flavonoids as molecules with the antitumor activity that targets TIMPs therapeutically. These inhibitors regulate tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover; they inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Data obtained in cell lines and in vivo models suggest that flavonoids are chemopreventive and cytotoxic against various types of cancer through several mechanisms. Flavonoids also regulate crucial signaling pathways such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor κB (NFκB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) involved in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.

Induction and maintenance of this state requires the coordinated functioning of various cortical and subcortical areas. The medial prefrontal (mPFC, the prelimbic area in rats) and posterior parietal cortices (pPC) form an attentional network involved in processing incentive stimuli. Given that the sexual incentive stimuli emitted by a receptive female are highly relevant for the male rat, it is probable that these cortices interact functionally in processing the sexual stimuli that produce SM. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize the cortical activation and degree of electroencephalographic coupling (coherence, hEEG) between the mPFC and pPC during a sexually-motivated state in male rats. Only rats that reached this state after 1 intromission prior to EEG recording, presented a higher frequency and duration of nose pokes, and showed higher prefronto-parietal activation and EEG synchronization while close to an inaccessible receptive female. Results show that both cortices are activated and that they are functionally coupled during the processing of sexually-relevant stimuli mainly in the right hemisphere, a key condition for inducing SM. We conclude that the attentional network made up of the prefrontal and parietal cortices participates in the adequate attention to, and processing of, sexual incentive stimuli and, hence, in inducing SM in male rats.;EEG | Parietal cortex | Prefrontal cortex | Rats | Sexual motivation;0;0;;;;undefined;

Annual killifish have adapted to life in temporary pools by producing embryos that undergo diapause to traverse the dry phase. To fill existing knowledge gaps about embryo diapause regulation and evolution in annual killifishes, we test the effect of maternal age, incubation temperature, and incubation medium on diapause induction and length in Millerichthys robustus, the only North American fish species that has evolved an annual life history. Results: All embryos at extreme temperatures follow a defined developmental pathway: skipping diapause at 30°C, and entering diapause at 18°C, both regardless of maternal age, and incubation medium. However, maternal age, and incubation medium influenced whether diapause is entered, and time arrested in diapause for embryos incubated at 25°C. At 25°C, five-week-old, and 52-week-old females produced more embryos that entered diapause than 26-week-old females. Also, embryos incubated in aqueous medium skipped diapause more frequently at this intermediate temperature. Conclusions: Millerichthys developmental dynamics associated with maternal age under intermediate range of temperatures are likely adapted to the particular patterns of flood/drought in North American temporary pools. Millerichthys also exhibits developmental patterns largely comparable with other annual fishes, probably due to common seasonal patterns in temporary pools.;annualism | developmental ecology | diapause dynamics | life history strategies | variable environments;0;0;;;;undefined;

Watson (Papaveraceae) is known as “palo llora sangre” and is used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of infections, it is also used as anxiolytic, analgesic, and antidiabetic, among others. Aim of the study: to evaluate the antinociceptive and gastroprotective activities of extracts from B. arborea and dihydrosanguinarine (DHS) in murine models. Materials and methods: Organic extracts [hexane (HEX), dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol (MeOH)] were obtained by maceration. DHS was isolated and purified from HEX and DCM by precipitation and chromatographic column, respectively. Organic extracts and DHS were evaluated to determine their antinociceptive effect using formalin test in murine model. Also, the ambulatory effect of the HEX and DHS was determined in Open field test. The possible mechanism of action of DHS was explored in the presence of naltrexone (NTX, 1 mg/kg, i.p.), and picrotoxin (PTX, 1 mg/kg, i.p.). Gastric damage as possible adverse effect or gastroprotection were also investigated. Whereas DHS acute toxicological study was done, and 100 mg/kg of DHS was examined by electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis to discard neurotoxic effects. Results: The B. arborea extracts significantly showed effects in both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of the formalin test, where the HEX extract reached the major antinociceptive effect. A significant and dose-response (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg) antinociceptive activity was observed with the HEX (ED50 = 69 mg/kg) and DHS (ED50 = 85 mg/kg) resembling the effect of the reference analgesic drug tramadol (30 mg/kg). The significant effect of DHS was inhibited in the presence of NTX and PTX. Neither the extracts or DHS produced sedative effects or gastric damage per se at antinociceptive doses. The EEG analysis demonstrated central depressant activity but not sedative or neurotoxic effects at the highest antinociceptive dosage tested, and LD50 is higher than 2000 mg/kg. Conclusions: HEX, DCM, and MeOH extracts showed significant antinociceptive activity, and DHS was identified as one of bioactive compounds without producing sedative, neurotoxic or gastric damage effects, as possible adverse effects reported for analgesic drugs. A role of opioid and GABAA neurotransmission appears to be involved as mechanisms of action of DHS, suggesting its potential for pain therapy and reinforcing the traditional use of B. arborea.;Anti-inflammatory | Antinociceptive | Benzophenanthridine | Bocconia arborea | Dihydrosanguinarine;1;0;;;SEP;226454 / 256448;Secretaría de Educación Pública

The present work evaluated the effect of different extracts separated from this plant, TlHex, TlEA, TlMet, and TlAq, and of two isolated coumarins, herniarin (HN) and dimethylfraxetin (DF), on haloperidol-induced catalepsy (HAL), and psychotic behaviors provoked with a glutamatergic antagonist, ketamine (KET) on ICR mice. The extracts TlEA, TlAq, and the isolated compounds HN and DF, induced an increment of the cataleptic effect of HAL. Schizophrenia-like symptoms caused by KET were analyzed through the behavior of the animals in the open field (OFT), forced swimming (FST), passive avoidance test (PAT), and social interaction test (SIT). Treatments derived from T. lucida could interact with this substance in all tests except for FST, in which only TlMet blocks its activity. Mainly, TlEA, TlAq, HN, and DF, blocked the effects of KET on stereotyped behavior, hyperlocomotion, cognitive impairment, and detriment in the social interaction of rodents.

The plastid genomes (ptDNAs) of colorless chlamydomonadaleans are surprisingly diverse in architecture, including highly expanded forms (Polytoma uvella and Leontynka pallida) as well as outright genome loss (Polytomella species). Here, we explore the ptDNAs of Hyalomonas (Hm.) oviformis (SAG 62-27; formerly known as Polytoma oviforme) and Hyalogonium (Hg.) fusiforme (SAG 62-1c), each representing independent losses of photosynthesis within the Chlamydophyceae. The Hm. oviformis ptDNA is moderately sized (132 kb) with a reduced gene complement (but still encoding the ATPase subunits) and is in fact smaller than that of its photosynthetic relative Hyalomonas chlamydogama SAG 11-48b (198.3 kb). The Hg. fusiforme plastome, however, is the largest yet observed in nonphotosynthetic plants or algae (~463 kb) and has a coding repertoire that is almost identical to that of its photosynthetic relatives in the genus Chlorogonium. Furthermore, the ptDNA of Hg. fusiforme shows no clear evidence of pseudogenization, which is consistent with our analyses showing that Hg. fusiforme is the nonphotosynthetic lineage of most recent origin among known colorless Chlamydophyceae. Together, these new ptDNAs clearly show that, in contrast to parasitic algae, plastid genome compaction is not an obligatory route following the loss of photosynthesis in free-living algae, and that certain chlamydomonadalean algae have a remarkable propensity for genomic expansion, which can persist regardless of the trophic strategy.";gene losses | genome reduction | Hyalogonium | Hyalomonas | loss of photosynthesis | nonphotosynthetic algae | plastid genome | Polytoma | Polytomella;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;NSERC;RGPIN‐2018‐04025;Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

With rising water demands and dwindling supplies, these harmful compounds must be isolated from wastewater and kept out of the aquatic environment. In the research presented here, hydrothermal synthesis of manganese-doped zinc ferrites’ (Mn-ZnFe2O4) nanoparticles (NPs) and their nanocomposites (NCs) with sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride (Mn-ZnFe2O4/S-g-C3N4) are described. The samples’ morphological, structural, and bonding features were investigated using SEM, XRD, and FTIR techniques. A two-phase photocatalytic degradation study of (0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 wt.%) Mn-doped ZnFe2O4 NPs and Mn-ZnFe2O4/(10, 30, 50, 60, and 70 wt.%) S-g-C3N4 NCs against MB was carried out to find the photocatalyst with maximum efficiency. The 9% Mn-ZnFe2O4 NPs and Mn-ZnFe2O4/50% S-g-C3N4 NCs exhibited the best photocatalyst efficiency in phase one and phased two, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Mn-ZnFe2O4/50% S-g-C3N4 NCs could be attributed to synergistic interactions at the Mn-ZnFe2O4/50% S-g-C3N4 NCs interface that resulted in a more effective transfer and separation of photo-induced charges. Therefore, it is efficient, affordable, and ecologically secure to modify ZnFe2O4 by doping with Mn and homogenizing with S-g-C3N4. As a result, our current research suggests that the synthetic ternary hybrid Mn-ZnFe2O4/50% S-g-C3N4 NCs may be an effective photocatalytic system for degrading organic pollutants from wastewater.;charge separation | degrading organic pollutants | hydrothermal technique | integration | manganese;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;PNU;22UQU4320141DSR44;Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University

A recent phylogenetic study transferred some Mexican laelias to the genus Schomburgkia, which has generated debate. The aim of the present study was to analyze the patterns of species richness and endemism and the current and potential geographic distributions of the taxa of Laelia s.l., as well as the putative Laelia s.s., distributed in Mexico as part of an exploratory evaluation of the generic limits to sheds light on the taxonomic debate and generate baselines to guide conservation efforts. A database was generated with information from herbarium specimens and publications. The species richness was estimated by political division, biomes, and elevation. The endemism was analyzed by political division and using the weighted and corrected weighted endemism indices. Geographic data, climatic, and topographic variables were used to predict the distributions with the maximum entropy algorithm. The results supported the proposal to transfer some species to the genus Schomburgkia. Some areas of the Sierra Madre del Sur and Oriental should be included as priority areas in the conservation strategies of Laelia.

In this work, we evaluated the antitumor activity of three acyclic terpenoids obtained from A. macroprophyllata to assess their potential as antilymphoma agents. We identified the terpenoids farnesyl acetate (FA), phytol (PT) and geranylgeraniol (Gg) using gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and spectroscopic (1H, and 13C NMR) methods applied to petroleum ether extract of leaves from A. macroprophyllata (PEAm). We investigated antitumor potential in Balb/c mice inoculated with U-937 cells by assessing brine shrimp lethality (BSL), and cytotoxic activity in these cells. In addition, to assess the potential toxicity of PEAm, FA, PT and Gg in humans, we tested their acute oral toxicity in mice. Our results showed that the three terpenoids exhibited considerable antilymphoma and cytotoxic activity. In terms of lethality, we determined a median lethal dose (LD50) for thirteen isolated products of PEAm. Gg, PT and AF all exhibited a higher lethality with values of 1.41 ± 0.42, 3.03 ± 0.33 and 5.82 ± 0.58 µg mL−1, respectively. To assess cytotoxic activity against U-937 cells, we calculated the mean cytotoxic concentration (CC50) and found that FA and PT were closer in respect to the control drug methotrexate (MTX, 0.243 ± 0.007 µM). In terms of antilymphoma activity, we found that FA, PT and Gg considerably inhibited lymph node growth, with median effective doses (ED50) of 5.89 ± 0.39, 6.71 ± 0.31 and 7.22 ± 0.51 mg kg−1 in females and 5.09 ± 0.66, 5.83 ± 0.50 and 6.98 ± 0.57mg kg −1 in males, respectively. Regarding acute oral toxicity, we classified all three terpenoids as category IV, indicating a high safety margin for human administration. Finally, in a molecular docking study of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, we found binding of terpenoids to some amino acids of the catalytic site, suggesting an effect upon activity with a resulting decrease in the synthesis of intermediates involved in the prenylation of proteins involved in cancer progression. Our findings suggest that the acyclic terpenoids FA, PT, and Gg may serve as scaffolds for the development of new treatments for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.;acute toxicity | antilymphoma activity | brine shrimp lethality | cytotoxic activity | farnesyl acetate | GC-MS analysis | geranylgeraniol | phytol | U-937 cells;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;824372;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The objective of the study was, through high-frequency temporal sampling, to analyze the diversity, seasonal and diel distribution patterns of anchovies and their relationships with environmental variables. For 19 months, 24-h monthly cycles were carried out, taking samples every two hours. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were used for data analysis. Seven species were captured, of which, Anchoa mitchilli, Anchoa hepsetus, Anchoa lyolepis, Anchoa lamprotaenia and Cetengraulis edentulus are common in brackish waters; however, Anchoviella perfasciata and Engraulis eurystole rarely occur in these systems. For these species, no major threats are known; therefore, they are listed as ‘Least Concern’. A seasonal succession shows pulses during the closed-mouth phase and during the late warm-rainy season. At diel level, A. mitchilli, C. edentulus and A. lamprotaenia showed a markedly nocturnal pattern. RDA correlations showed that salinity, day/night effect, inlet state and rainfall were the most important factors related to anchovy distribution. Segregation along a salinity gradient was observed, in which A. mitchilli was captured mainly at low salinities, while other species occurred mainly at intermediate to high salinities.

Antennas to treat bone tissue (~3 cm2), has been lately designed. Bone tumors at pathological stage T1 can reach 8 cm wide. An antenna cannot cover it; therefore, our goal is to evaluate the thermal performance of multi-antenna arrays. Linear, triangular, and square configurations of double slot (DS) and monopole (MTM) antennas were evaluated. A parametric study (finite element method), with variations in distance between antennas (ad) and bone thickness (bt) was implemented. Array feasibility was evaluated by SWR, ablated tissue volume, etc. The linear configuration with DS and MTM antennas showed SWR ≤ 1.6 for ad = 1 mm–15 mm and bt = 20 mm–40 mm, and ad = 10 mm–15 mm and bt = 25 mm–40 mm, respectively; the triangular showed SWR ≤ 1.5 for ad = 5 mm–15 mm and bt = 20 mm–40 mm and ad = 10 mm–15 mm and bt = 25 mm–40 mm. The square configuration (DS) generated SWR ≤ 1.5 for ad = 5 mm–20 mm and bt = 20 mm–40 mm, and the MTM, SWR ≤ 1.5 with ad = 10 mm and bt = 25 mm–40 mm. Ablated tissue was 4.65 cm3–10.46 cm3 after 5 min. According to treatment time and array configuration, maximum temperature and ablated tissue is modified.

Labor is a potentially stressful and painful event, due to the contractions that promote expulsion of the fetus. During labor, neurotransmitters such as the prostaglandins contribute to the sensitization of oxytocin receptors in the myometrium and the activation of nociceptive fibers, thus supporting the physiological role of pain. Endogenously, the body secretes opioid peptides that modulate harmful stimuli and, at the same time, can inhibit oxytocin’s action in the myometrium. Treating pain during the different stages of parturition is an option that can help prevent such consequences as tachycardia, changes in breathing patterns, and respiratory acidosis, all of which can harm the wellbeing of offspring. However, studies have found that some analgesics can promote myometrial contractility, increase expulsion time, affect fetal circulation, and alter mother–offspring recognition due to hypnotic effects. Other data, however, indicate that reducing the number of uterine contractions with analgesics increases their potency, thus improving maternal performance. Managing pain during labor requires understanding the tocolytic properties of analgesics and their advantages in preventing the consequences of pain.;analgesics | calving | farrowing | labor pain | pain;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Though there are still gaps in the literature regarding its plausible beneficial effects, the suggestion that this alternative therapy can improve the inflammatory and antioxidant response to control epileptic seizures is explored throughout this study. Epilepsy is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world. However, the appropriate mechanisms for it to be fully controlled are still unknown. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress promote epileptic seizures' appearance and might even aggravate them. There is growing evidence that caloric restriction has extensive anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. For instance, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have been proposed to induce antioxidant processes and ulteriorly improve the disease progression. Caloric restriction can be an option for those patients with refractory epilepsy since it allows for anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties to evolve within the brain areas involved.;Antioxidant | Caloric restriction | Epilepsy | Neuroinflammation | Nrf2 | Oxidative stress;0;0;;;IPN;1025766;Instituto Politécnico Nacional

Age-specific survival of P. patulus showed a rapid decline within one week when exposed to plant extracts compared to conditioned medium. The average lifespan of P. patulus was longer in the macrophyte-conditioned medium as compared to the controls, but shorter in the aqueous plant extract. Gross and net reproductive rates showed similar trends, wherein the controls had significantly higher values than those exposed to plant extracts, but increased with the conditioned medium only at the two lower concentrations tested.

The spinal cord can be considered a center for controlling circadian rhythms by changing clock gene expression. However, to date, it is not known if mechanonociception itself has a circadian rhythm. The hypothalamic A11 area represents the primary source of dopamine (DA) in the spinal cord and has been found to be involved in clock gene expression and circadian rhythmicity. Here, we investigate if the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) has a circadian rhythm, as well as the role of the dopaminergic A11 nucleus, DA, and DA receptors (DR) in the PWT circadian rhythm and if they modify clock gene expression in the lumbar spinal cord. Naïve rats showed a circadian rhythm of the PWT of almost 24 h, beginning during the night–day interphase and peaking at 14.63 h. Similarly, DA and DOPAC’s spinal contents increased at dusk and reached their maximum contents at noon. The injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the A11 nucleus completely abolished the circadian rhythm of the PWT, reduced DA tissue content in the lumbar spinal cord, and induced tactile allodynia. Likewise, the repeated intrathecal administration of D1-like and D2-like DA receptor antagonists blunted the circadian rhythm of PWT. 6-OHDA reduced the expression of Clock and Per1 and increased Per2 gene expression during the day. In contrast, 6-OHDA diminished Clock, Bmal, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1, and Cry2 at night. The repeated intrathecal administration of the D1-like antagonist (SCH-23390) reduced clock genes throughout the day (Clock and Per2) and throughout the night (Clock, Per2 and Cry1), whereas it increased Bmal and Per1 throughout the day. In contrast, the intrathecal injection of the D2 receptor antagonists (L-741,626) increased the clock genes Bmal, Per2, and Per3 and decreased Per1 throughout the day. This study provides evidence that the circadian rhythm of the PWT results from the descending dopaminergic modulation of spinal clock genes induced by the differential activation of spinal DR.;circadian rhythms | clock gene | D1 receptor | D2 receptor | dopaminergic A11 nucleus | lumbar spinal cord | mechanonociception | paw withdrawal threshold;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CINVESTAV;undefined;Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional

Fresh juice from mature fruits was characterized. One portion of this juice was spontaneously left to ferment (native fermentation), and the other was inoculated with Lp (controlled fermentation). Fermentation was monitored each 8 h by 56 h to measure microbial growth, pH, acidity, sugars, soluble protein, polyphenols and flavonoids, antioxidant activity, and effects on glycemia. In native fermentation, the growth of total microorganisms increased up to 32 h, decreasing at the end of the process. In Lp fermentation, total microorganisms increased until 16 h to stay constant at the end, with a predominance of Lp. The pH and the sugars decreased in the two fermentations, while polyphenol and flavonoid increased. In spontaneous fermentation, these changes were lesser. Both fermentations, like fresh juice, preserve functional properties (antioxidant, alpha-glucosidase inhibition, and hypoglycemia).

Reproductive performance data were gathered for 90 d. The cows treated with enro-C became PCR negative: 87.5% and 78.94% on day 5, 92.85% and 94.73% on day 28 (in the HL and TL, respectively). For streptomycin/penicillin-G, the same values were 65.45% and 70.90% on day 5, and 73.68% twice on day 28 in the HL and TL, respectively. In both groups and geographical settings, the MAT titers dropped on day 28 but remained above reference values usually considered negative. The gestation rates were: 86.53% and 79.06% and 88.88% and 87.5% for the HL and TL, either with enro-C or streptomycin/penicillin-G, respectively.

Porcine orthorubulavirus (PRV) is the etiological agent, and the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN) is characterized as the best antigen for serological tests, although other structural proteins, including the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix (M) protein, have been investigated during the infection of members of the Paramyxoviridae family, generating promising results. Herein, for the first time, we successfully produced and characterized both the NP and M proteins of PRV by using a recombinant strategy in the E. coli heterologous system. The ORF of the NP and M genes were cloned in-frame with the pET-SUMO expression vector. Recombinant proteins proved to be a sensitive target to detect seroconversion at 7 days until 28 days in vaccinated mice (BALB/c) by indirect ELISAs. Immunoreactivity was also tested using porcine serum samples, in which antibodies were recognized from early stages to a persistence of PRV infection, which is indicative that these proteins contain properties similar to native antigens. The predicted tertiary structure showed that both proteins have a conserved structure that resembles those found in others Paramyxovirus.

Significant differences were found in each honey extract with respect to the ultrasonic treatment applied (p < 0.05). In the honey extract P-A1 treated with 20 min of ultrasound, the phenols reached a maximum concentration of 29.91 ± 1.56 mg EQ/100 g, and the flavonoids of 1.92 ± 0.01 mg EQ/100 g; in addition, an inhibition of α-amylase of 37.14 ± 0.09% was noted. There were also differences in the phases of intestinal and gastric digestion, presenting a decrease in phenols (3.92 ± 0.042 mg EQ/100 g), flavonoids (0.61 ± 0.17 mg EAG/100 mg), antioxidant capacity (8.89 ± 0.56 mg EAG/100 mg), and amylase inhibition (9.59 ± 1.38%). The results obtained from this study indicate that, in some honeys, the processing method could increase the concentration of bioactive compounds, the antioxidant capacity, and the enzymatic inhibition; however, when subjected to in vitro digestion, the properties of honey are modified.

Poorest households in the Tupiza watershed in Bolivia are located in rural areas where water access for irrigation and safe drinking water is becoming increasingly scarce. Small-scale unregulated mining offers an alternative for revenue making in rural households, although wastewater from industry threatens water quality and new technologies to reduce water pollution are not implemented in this region yet. This study analyses water access and poverty linkages using the Multidimensional Poverty Analysis (MDPA) framework from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) to guide a survey and to develop indicators using the Shapley-Owen decomposition method and multivariate regressions. A set of household-level policies were included to predict the influence of these policies on poverty reduction estimates. Results have shown that remote communities in rural areas have the lowest value of multidimensional poverty and for some of these communities mining activities represent an alternative that could be considered if their water access conditions worsen over time. While mining can bring better monetary benefits, it can cause the degradation of ecological flows from the produced wastewater. Under the current technologies and processes, it can pose negative impacts on water quality and threatens the public health of these communities.;communities | multidimensional poverty | regression | Shapley-Owen method | vulnerability | water access;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;Sida;11972;Styrelsen för Internationellt Utvecklingssamarbete

Two hundred Ross 380 chickens, half male, half female, and one day old, were randomly distributed in a 4x2x2 factorial arrangement. The factors were the treatment (0%, 1.67%, 3.34%, and 5.01% of GSM in the diet), sex, and content of n-3 in the legs with thighs and the breasts. Each treatment had five repetitions with 10 birds each. There were no differences (p > 0.05) in the production parameters for both sexes. The contents of EPA, DPA, and DHA increased in the females and in the legs with thighs (p < 0.05) with GSM. Acceptance for the flavor and texture of meat was higher in the treatment with 1.67% GSM than in the other treatments.

Animal fighting, including dogfighting, is a prime example where animals often require veterinary care, either to treat wounds and fractures or to manage pain associated with tissue and where death may even result. Amongst the detrimental health effects arising are the sensory alterations that these injuries cause, which not only include acute or chronic pain but can also trigger a greater sensitivity to other harmful (hyperalgesia) or even innocuous stimuli (allodynia). These neurobiological aspects are often ignored and the erroneous assumption made that the breeds engaged in organized fighting have a high pain threshold or, at least, they present reduced or delayed responses to painful stimuli. However, it is now widely recognized that the damage these dogs suffer is not only physical but psychological, emotional, and sensory. Due to the impact fighting has on canine welfare, it is necessary to propose solution strategies, especially educational ones, i.e., educating people and training veterinarians, the latter potentially playing a key role in alerting people to all dog welfare issues. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the risk factors associated with dogfighting generally (dog temperament, age, sex, nutrition, testosterone levels, environment, isolation conditions, socialization, education, or training). A neurobiological approach to this topic is taken to discuss the impact on dog pain and emotion. Finally, a general discussion of the format of guidelines and laws that seek to sanction them is presented. The role that veterinarians can play in advancing dog welfare, rehabilitating dogs, and educating the public is also considered.;animal fight | dog aggression | dog fight | dog welfare | illegal sports | pain;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis caused by pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira that affects mainly reproductive performance in sheep. Objective. To identify the seroprevalence of Leptospira spp., associated serogroups, and possible risk factors in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Methodology. Blood samples were collected from 405 sheep in 55 farms located in 13 municipalities distributed along three ovine-producing regions in the state. Serological diagnosis was made by Microscopic Agglutination Technique (MAT). The prevalence and its confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Vassarstats software, the Odds Ratio (OR) values were estimated with WinEpiscope. Results. An overall seroprevalence of 53.83% (95%CI:48.84-58.75), per municipality of 100% (95%CI :71.66-100) and per flock of 92.73% (95%CI: 81.58-97.65) were noted. The highest prevalence by region was 58.82% (95%CI:%:50.57-66.62) for Los Tuxtlas (p= 0.218) and per municipality 86.36% (95%CI:71.95-94.33) for Ángel R. Cabada. The predominant serogroup was Hardjo (45.93%; 95%CI:41.02-50.92). By age, the highest values were 55.93% (95%CI:48.29-63.31) in the group of 19-36 months. The main recognized risk factors were region and municipality. Los Tuxtlas Region (OR =1.92; 95%CI:1.08-3.43) and the municipalities of Ángel R. Cabada (OR=15.5; 95%CI:5.1-47.2), Ayahualulco (OR=10.1; 95%CI :3.6-28.7), and Coatzintla (OR=6.1; 95%CI: 30.3 - 95.0). Implications. This study explores the presence of antibodies against Leptospira spp. in sheep, its associated serogroups and risk factors in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. This is this first report on the presence and relevance of this infection in sheep of this region. The role of sheep as a maintenance host for Leptospira spp. in endemic areas is stressed.

Didymozoid infection route during the early life cycle was inferred combining morphological (light microscopy) and molecular (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, cox1) evidence. Didymozoid rediae parasitizing F. desmarestia were observed, just after field collection of the host, containing hundredths of completely developed cystophorous cercariae, releasing them though the birth pore at approximately one cercaria every 12 s. Cercariae lost their tails developing into a ‘young metacercaria’ in 1 d at 22 °C without need of an intermediate host. Molecular analysis of cox1 showed that rediae found in F. desmarestia belong to two distinct didymozoid species (Didymozoidae sp. 1 and sp. 2). Metacercariae parasitizing chaetognaths were morphologically identified as Didymozoidae type Monilicaecum and cox1 sequences showed that metacercariae of chaetognaths matched with these two Didymozoidae sp. 1, and sp. 2 species found parasitizing F. desmarestia, plus a third distinct Didymozoidae sp. 3. These are the first DNA sequences of cox1 gene from didymozoid larvae for any zooplankton taxonomic group in the world. We concluded that F. desmarestia is the first intermediate host of rediae and cercariae, and the chaetognaths are the second intermediate hosts where non-encysted metacercariae were found. The definitive host is still unknown because cox1 sequences of present study did not genetically match with any available cox1 sequence of adult didymozoid. Our results demonstrate a potential overlap in the distribution of two carnivorous zooplankton taxonomic groups that are intermediate hosts of didymozoids in the pelagic habitat. The didymozoid specimens were not identified to species level because any of the cox1 sequences generated here matched with the sequences of adult didymozoids currently available in GenBank and Bold System databases. This study provides baseline information for the future morphological and molecular understanding of the Didymozoidae larvae that has been previously based on the recognition of the 12 known morphotypes.;Carnivorous zooplankton | Cox1 | Cystophorous cercariae | Gulf of California | Metacercariae | Rediae;1;0;repositoryam;Green;UQ;20150113;University of Queensland

Our research group has shown that the combined treatment of metformin (MTF) and exercise has beneficial effects for preventing muscle loss and fat accumulation, by modulating the redox state. To get an insight into the mechanism of the combined treatment, the mitochondrial bioenergetics was studied in the mitochondria isolated from old female Wistar rats quadriceps muscles. The animals were divided into six groups; three performed exercise on a treadmill for 5 days/week for 20 months, and the other three were sedentary. Also, two groups of each were treated with MTF for 6 or 12 months. The rats were euthanized at 24 months. The mitochondria were isolated and supercomplexes formation along with oxygen consumption, ATP synthesis, and ROS generation were evaluated. Our results showed that the combined treatment for 12 months increased the complex I and IV activities associated with the supercomplexes, simultaneously, ATP synthesis increased while ROS production decreased, indicating a tightly coupled mitochondria.

We detected a strong impact of seasonality on the structure of ecological interactions, with more complex and robust interactions among bee and plant species in the rainy season. We did not find statistical support for a relationship among disturbance, nestedness, or niche overlap. We did find disturbance negatively affected plant robustness to secondary extinctions. Four plants: Echinocactus platyacanthus, Opuntia stenopetala, Senna wislizeni var. painteri and Cylindropuntia imbricata comprised the core species that were primarily responsible for the resilience of the bee communities. The following bees conformed the generalist core of species: Diadasia rinconis, Lasioglossum (Dialictus) sp. 1, Apis mellifera, and Augochlorella pomoniella. Overall, network nestedness and robustness differed significantly between seasons but not among sites with different levels of disturbance.;ecological interactions | human activities | Mexico | network nestedness | pollinators | Querétaro | resilience;1;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;CONCYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, Guatemala

By proposing a series of predictions regarding such relationship, we evaluate the existence of a link between gut microbiota and primate social behavior. Overall, we find that enough empirical evidence already supports these predictions. Nonetheless, we conclude that studies with the necessary, sufficient, explicit, and available evidence are still scarce.

Present-day Kumiai recognize that their traditional diet was more nutritious and more connected with nature than their current diet, and express concern over transmitting existing knowledge about it to younger generations. We conclude that the characteristics of the Kumiai traditional food system not only strengthen their cultural identity and community economies, but also present potential solutions to the problem of food system sustainability by way of wild food resource management, as well as containing elements of a strategy for improving the health of community members.;Kumiai ethnobotany | Kumiai native group | sustainable food systems | traditional food knowledge | traditional food systems | traditional foods and health | wild foods;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

After a seven-week feeding trial, growth performance, hepatopancreas and muscle fatty acid (FA) composition, expression of lipid-relevant genes, and blood parameters were evaluated. Four isoproteic and isolipidic experimental diets were formulated to contain 44% crude protein and 11% lipids with graded inclusion levels of ARA, 0% (Control), 0.4, 0.9, and 1.4% of the total diet. S. dorsalis juveniles (14.54 ± 0.18 g) were randomly divided into twelve tanks with fifteen animals each. The animals were hand fed three times per day to apparent satiation. Dietary treatments did not significantly affect the growth performance, SGR, FCR, and feed intake of fish. Different levels of ARA in the experimental diets directly influenced liver and muscle FA profiles, with significant changes in ARA and EPA deposition between Control treatment and 1.4%, in both tissues. The expression of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (alox5), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain (acadvl), carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1(cpt1a) was significantly affected by dietary treatments, with an expression increasing accordingly to the increasing ARA levels. In contrast, a reduction of fatty acid synthase (fas) and proliferator-activated receptor alpha (ppara) expression was significantly reduced as ARA increased in the diet. In addition, a significant reduction in blood cortisol and glucose was found at a 0.9% ARA level compared to the other treatments. Based on the performance, cortisol levels, the gene expression for eicosanoids synthesis, and lipid metabolic pathways, the present study suggests a maximum ARA inclusion of 0.9% in diets for California yellowtail juveniles, S. dorsalis.;aquafeed | gene expression | lipid replacement | marine fish | stress response;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;FAPESP;22a/403/1/C/10/22;Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo

The anurofauna of Mexico’s tropical dry forest ecosystem host a high proportion of the species and endemism registered in the country. In terms of conservation, both dry forests and amphibians are at risk due to climate change because it is expected that as the temperature becomes higher and precipitation decreases, this vegetation type may experience water stress. We applied the MaxEnt algorithm to estimate the potential current and future (year 2070) geographic distribution patterns of 95 endemic Mexican anuran species inhabiting the country’s tropical dry forests by considering two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5/RCP8.5) and analyzed the potential distributional pattern changes. The results indicated that overall, species would experience enough of a significant warming effect to cause a reduction in the original distribution area, with 44% of species losing an average of 50% of their original range (9 spp. in threatened category); additionally, 22% of the species in the dry forest ecosystem will experience an average increase of almost 50% in their original area, two species will lose more than 80% of their range, and one will disappear.";Anura | climate change | endemic | MaxEnt | Mexico | tropical dry forest;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;592795;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This process is mediated by the concerted action of the Elongation Factor-like 1 (human EFL1, yeast Efl1) GTPase and its effector, the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome protein (human SBDS, yeast Sdo1). Mutations in these proteins prevent the release of eIF6 and cause a disease known as Shwachman–Diamond Syndrome (SDS). While some mutations in EFL1 or SBDS result in insufficient proteins to meet the cell production of mature large ribosomal subunits, others do not affect the expression levels with unclear molecular defects. We studied the functional consequences of one such mutation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae Efl1 R1086Q, equivalent to human EFL1 R1095Q described in SDS patients. We characterised the enzyme kinetics and energetic basis outlining the recognition of this mutant to guanine nucleotides and Sdo1, and their interplay in solution. From our data, we propose a model where the conformational change in Efl1 depends on a long-distance network of interactions that are disrupted in mutant R1086Q, whereby Sdo1 and the guanine nucleotides no longer elicit the conformational changes previously described in the wild-type protein. These findings point to the molecular malfunction of an EFL1 mutant and its possible impact on SDS pathology.;conformational change | EFL1 | guanine nucleotides | ITC | magnesium ions | SBDS | SDS;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;283909;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Due to risks associated with human exposure to glyphosate and its potential harmfulness, the need to develop specific, accurate, online, and sensitive methods is imperative. In accordance with this, the present review is focused on recent advances in developing nanomaterial-based sensors for glyphosate detection. Reported data from the literature concerning glyphosate detection in the different matrices using analytical methods (mostly chromatographic techniques) are presented; however, they are expensive and time-consuming. In this sense, nanosensors’ potential applications are explained to establish their advantages over traditional glyphosate detection methods. Zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three- dimensional (3D) materials are reviewed, from biomolecules to metallic compounds. Bionanomaterials have generated research interest due to their selectivity with respect to using enzymes, DNA, or antibodies. On the other hand, Quantum Dots also are becoming relevant for their vast surface area and good limit of detection values (in the range of pM). This review presents all the characteristics and potential applications of different nanomaterials for sensor development, bearing in mind the necessity of a glyphosate detection method with high sensitivity, selectivity, and portability.";glyphosate | herbicide | nanomaterials | sensor | water-detection;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;364335;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

However, little is known about longitudinal changes within the vaginal microbiota composition from the third trimester of pregnancy to childbirth in healthy women. Thus, we conducted an exploratory longitudinal study of vaginal microbiota composition of 10 Mexican pregnant women, sampling from the same volunteer at two-time points: third trimester of pregnancy and active childbirth. Vaginal bacterial microbiota was characterized by V3-16S rDNA libraries by high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics methods. Out of ten, vaginal microbiota from eight women was dominated by the Lactobacillus genus at both time points, whereas the other two women showed vaginal microbiota composition with high abundance of genera Gardnerella, Prevotella, and members of the Atopobiaceae family, without any preterm birth correlation. Importantly, we found no statistically significant differences in relative abundances, absolute reads count, alpha and beta diversity between the third trimester of pregnancy, and active childbirth time points. However, compared to the third trimester of pregnancy, we observed a trend with higher absolute reads counts for Gardnerella, Faecalibaculum, Ileibacterium, and Lactococcus genus at active childbirth and lower absolute reads count of Lactobacillus genus. Our results suggest that the vaginal microbiota composition is stable, and Lactobacillus genus is the dominant taxa in Mexican women’s vagina at the third trimester of pregnancy and childbirth.;;1;0;;;CONACYT;513607;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Dietary interventions that promote anti-stress mechanisms could also increase health and lifespan. To test whether a lipophilic native tomato extract with high antioxidant activity extends health and lifespan, we treated the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and found that tomato extract increases resistance to oxidative and thermal stress, and extended lifespan in wild type. These effects were lost in mutants of the insulin/insulin-like signalling pathway indicating that tomato extract acts by this pathway. In addition, beneficial effects on oxidative and thermal stress resistance were dependent on stress-related transcription factors, but independent of caloric restriction. These results suggest that the antioxidant activity of the tomato extract was, at least in part, mediated by insulin/insulin-like signalling pathway and transcription factors.

The actinobacteria with the most significant biosynthetic potential are the genus Streptomyces, Saccharopolyspora, and Micromonospora containing groups of biosynthetic genes such as polyketide synthase systems, non-ribosomal peptide synthase systems, terpenoid systems, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide systems, among others. This review focuses on genomic mining techniques and current helpful software to search for new natural products in actinobacteria. Currently, molecular techniques have been developed to improve the isolation of natural products, and bioinformatics programs, many are free to access, have been designed to analyze genes and microbial genomes that predict new molecule production. Thanks to these techniques, new natural products of industrial interest have been found in rare actinobacteria such as Nocardia and Rhodococcus.;Actinobacteria | bioinformatics | genomic mining;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Disease severity may be associated with a metabolic imbalance related to amino acids, lipids, and energy-generating pathways. The aim of this study was to characterize the profile of amino acids and acylcarnitines in COVID-19 patients. A multicenter, cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 453 individuals were classified by disease severity. Levels of 11 amino acids, 31 acylcarnitines, and succinylacetone in serum samples were analyzed by electrospray ionization–triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Different clusters were observed in partial least squares discriminant analysis, with phenylalanine, alanine, citrulline, proline, and succinylacetone providing the major contribution to the variability in each cluster (variable importance in the projection >1.5). In logistic models adjusted by age, sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and nutritional status, phenylalanine was associated with critical outcomes (odds ratio=5.3 (95% CI 3.16-9.2) in the severe vs. critical model, with an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.90). In conclusion the metabolic imbalance in COVID-19 patients might affect disease progression. This work shows an association of phenylalanine with critical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, highlighting phenylalanine as a potential metabolic biomarker of disease severity.;amino acids | COVID-19 | metabolomics | phenylalanine | SARS – CoV – 2;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;INP;14080;Instituto Nacional de Pediatria

Their relationship with oxidative stress has motivated the research to find therapies and medications capable of suppressing oxidative damage and therefore slowing the progression of these diseases. Glutathione (GSH) is the most important cellular antioxidant in living beings and is responsible for regulating the cellular redox state. However, GSH cannot be administered by any route of administration, so molecules that increase its levels by activating Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway are explored; since Nrf2 regulates the main genes involved in GSH de novo synthesis and recycling. Astrocytes are the most important cell-type in the antioxidant cell response and are responsible for providing GSH and other substrates for neurons to have an efficient antioxidant response. Methotrexate (MTX) is an anti-inflammatory agent that has different cellular effects when administered at low or high concentrations. So in this study, we used MTX different concentrations and exposure times to induce a hormetic antioxidant response in rat primary astrocytes. Our results showed that 20 nM MTX pre-conditioning for 12 h augmented the GSH/GSSG ratio and protected cellular viability against a toxic MTX and H2O2 insult, which was abrogated when Nrf2 was inhibited by brusatol. Hence, MTX subsequent studies as a drug to counteract the progression of some stress-associated neurodegenerative diseases are suggested.";astrocytes | glutathione | hormesis | methotrexate | neurodegeneration | redox state;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;919024;

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of T. stans on a hypercaloric diet-induced metabolic syndrome model. An organic fraction obtained using liquid–liquid separation from the hydroalcoholic extract of T. stans and four subfractions of this organic fraction were administered for ten weeks to C57BL6J male mice previously fed with a hypercaloric diet. The hypercaloric diet caused changes in glucose levels (from 65.3 to 221.5 mg/dL), body weight (31.3 to 42.2 g), triglycerides (91.4 to 177.7 mg/dL), systolic (89.9 to 110.3 mmHg) and diastolic (61.6 to 73.7 mg/dL) blood pressure, and insulin resistance (4.47 to 5.16). Treatment with T. stans resulted in improvements in triglycerides (83.4–125.0 mg/dL), systolic blood pressure (75.1–91.8 mmHg), and insulin resistance (4.72–4.93). However, the organic fraction and hydroalcoholic extract produced a better response in diastolic blood pressure (52.8–56.4 mmHg). Luteolin, apigenin, and chrysoeriol were the major constituents in the most active subfractions.

Hsd:ICR male mice are divided into groups of the following five individuals each: (a) control 1, distilled water; (b) control 2, ethanol 30%; (c) resveratrol, 50 mg/kg by gavage; (d) CrO3, 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally; (e) resveratrol + CrO3, resveratrol administered 4 h prior to CrO3. The assessment is performed on peripheral blood. Micronuclei (MN) kinetics are measured from 0 to 72 h, while 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) adduct repair levels, endogenous antioxidant system biomarkers, and apoptosis frequency were quantified after 48 h. Resveratrol reduces the frequency of Cr(VI)-induced MN and shows significant effects on the 8-OHdG adduct levels, suggesting that cell repair could be enhanced by this polyphenol. Concomitant administration of resveratrol and Cr(VI) results in a return of the activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase to control levels, accompanied by modifications of superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels. Thus, antioxi-dant properties might play an important role in resveratrol-mediated inhibition of Cr(VI)-induced oxidant genotoxicity. The increase in apoptotic cells and the decrease in necrosis further confirmed that resveratrol effectively blocks the actions of Cr(VI).";8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine adduct repair | antigenotoxic | apoptosis | endogenous antioxidant system | hexavalent chromium | resveratrol;0;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;703847;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Urban blue spaces are critical for biodiversity, provide a range of ecosystem services, and can promote human health and wellbeing. Despite this, access to blue space is often unequally distributed across socioeconomic gradients, and the availability of quality blue space could extend to environmental justice issues. Three stages of analysis were carried out in Mexico City, Mexico and Bristol, UK to (i) assess associations between blue space and socioeconomic metrics at a regional scale, (ii) apply a rapid assessment tool to assess amenity, access and environmental quality, (iii) consider local quality across socioeconomic gradients at a regional scale. Still water availability was indicative of higher socioeconomic status, but contrasting city evolutions underpinned differences. Locally, there were environmental gradients from more complex to disturbed habitats that influenced potential wellbeing and amenity benefits. In combination, this may exacerbate inequalities and risk increasing ecosystem disservices. If cities are to be socially, and environmentally resilient to higher levels of disturbance in the future, healthy ecosystems will be key. However, further research is needed to address various dimensions of injustice in urban areas beyond blue space distribution.;Blue spaces | Freshwater distribution | Freshwater network | Habitat quality | Urban landscapes;0;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;ES/S006443/1;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

However, the rate of newborns produced using this technique remains low. Embryos produced through SCNT exhibit abnormal gene expression, often regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications, which establish the genome imprinted for the ontogenetic development of mammals. The objective of the present review was to describe the current state of the efficiency of sheep embryo production and newborn lamb generation through SCNT to offer an up-to-date reference. The primary strategy to improve SCNT in sheep is nuclear reprogramming. As such, the supplementation of vitamin C, scriptaid, zebularine, and oocyte extracts during somatic cell and embryo culture could improve nuclear reprogramming in cloned sheep embryos. Further, the modification of somatic cell chromatin and substitution of histones with protamines have been explored as additional strategies to improve SCNT. Elucidating the complexity of these processes will allow for the application of treatments or strategies aimed at improving the efficiency of SCNT and ensuring the quality of the produced offspring.;Efficiency | Embryos | SCNT | Sheep;0;0;;;CONACYT;570413;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the birth order and dam’s size during spontaneous labor and the alterations during the first minute of life. The results indicate that the dam’s size and the birth order have considerable physiological and metabolic effects in the puppies, mainly in birth order 1 (BO1) in small-size dogs, while in the medium size, the last puppy presented more alterations, probably because of a prolonged whelping which could have fostered hypoxic processes and death.

In addition, a simulation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of EOs on the economic and environmental impact of beef production. Data were extracted from 34 peer‐reviewed studies and analyzed using random‐effects statistical models to assess the weighted mean difference (WMD) between control and EOs treatments. Dietary supplementation of EOs increased (p < 0.01) dry matter intake (WMD = 0.209 kg/d), final body weight (WMD = 12.843 kg), daily weight gain (WMD = 0.087 kg/d), feed efficiency (WMD = 0.004 kg/kg), hot carcass weight (WMD = 5.45 kg), and Longissimus dorsi muscle area (WMD = 3.48 cm2). Lower (p < 0.05) ruminal concentration of ammonia nitrogen (WMD = −1.18 mg/dL), acetate (WMD = −4.37 mol/100 mol) and total protozoa (WMD = −2.17 × 105/mL), and higher concentration of propionate (WMD = 0.878 mol/100 mol, p < 0.001) were observed in response to EOs supplementation. Serum urea concentration (WMD = −1.35 mg/dL, p = 0.026) and haptoglobin (WMD = −39.67 μg/mL, p = 0.031) were lower in cattle supplemented with EOs. In meat, EOs supplementation reduced (p < 0.001) cooking loss (WMD = −61.765 g/kg), shear force (WMD = −0.211 kgf/cm2), and malondialdehyde content (WMD = −0.040 mg/kg), but did not affect pH, color (L* a* and b*), or chemical composition (p > 0.05). Simulation analysis showed that EOs increased economic income by 1.44% and reduced the environmental footprint by 0.83%. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of EOs improves productive performance and rumen fermentation, while increasing the economic profitability and reducing the environmental impact of beef cattle.

Thus, it is important that psychotherapists constantly regulate their own perspective and emotions to better understand the other's affective state. We compared the empathic abilities of a group of 52 psychotherapists with a group of 92 non-psychotherapists and found psychometric differences. Psychotherapists showed greater scores in Fantasy and Perspective Taking, both cognitive empathy constructs, and lower scores in the use of expressive suppression, an emotional regulation strategy that hampers the empathic response, suggesting that psychotherapists exert top-down processes that influence their empathic response. In addition, the expected sex differences in empathic concern and expressive suppression were only present in the non-psychotherapist group. To see if such psychometric differences were related to a distinctive functional organization of brain networks, we contrasted the resting state functional connectivity of empathy-related brain regions between a group of 18 experienced psychotherapists and a group of 18 non-psychotherapists. Psychotherapists showed greater functional connectivity between the left anterior insula and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and less connectivity between rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the orbito prefrontal cortex. Both associations correlated with Perspective Taking scores. Considering that the psychometric differences between groups were in the cognitive domain and that the functional connectivity associations involve areas related to cognitive regulation processes, these results suggest a relationship between the functional brain organization of psychotherapists and the cognitive regulation of their empathic response.;dmPFC | empathy | fantasy | lAi | oPFC | perspective taking | rACC | rs-fMRI;3;0;;;CONACYT;IN202119;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This study aims to compare the growth-related allometric relationships between Pilosocereus leucocephalus (Poselg.) Byles & G.D. Rowley and Cephalocereus scoparius (Poselg.) Britton & Rose, two conspicuous species of columnar cacti in the TDF of Mexico. Nonlinear regression models were used to estimate maximum height (Hmax) from diameter and Reduced Major Axis (RMA) regression models to relate crown cover a height and diameter. The scaling exponents in both species were similar to other pachycaulous plant species. However, despite a lower maximum height (Hmax) in the species P. leucocephalus, it has an allometric height exponent than that recorded in C. scoparius, which suggests that P. leucocephalus allocates more biomass to vertical development in the early stages of growth. Our results showed that the stems of C. scoparius increased in height at a far less rate concerning high than P. leucocephalus, demonstrating that cacti display different interspecific strategies to coexist in TDF. In contrast, greater height enables C. scoparius to reach the forest canopy and compete with C-3 tree species. The columnar cacti also differed in size and branch number through their development, thus representing two biomass allocation strategies to optimize light capture or cope with seasonal drought stress.;Allometric | Architecture | Branching | Crown | Plant morphology | Regression models;0;0;;;CONACYT;UVER-PTC-223;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Many toxic compounds can interfere in this process, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which belong to the perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Since both substances are found in many everyday materials and are highly persistent, they accumulate in organisms where they have been associated with fertility problems. This study analyzes the effects of PFOS and PFOA on the functionality of boar spermatozoa, and changes in the plasma membrane (PM) during capacitation. The median lethal concentrations (LC50) of PFOS and PFOA were 460 and 1894 µM, respectively, while the mean inhibitory concentrations of capacitation (ICC50) were 274 µM and 1458 µM, respectively. The ICC50 of PFOA was insufficient to reduce the capacitation, but 950 µM (½ LC50) of PFOA and the ICC50 of PFOS significantly reduced the number of capacitated spermatozoa. PFOS and PFOA also impeded the progesterone (P4)-induced acrosomal reaction (iAR). These effects occur despite the accumulation of [Ca2+]i under capacitating conditions. The accumulation of [Ca2+]i produces saturation, which prevents its entry through ionophore A23187 and P4 in the presence of PFOS. Membrane potential (Emv) was deregulated. Both PFAS affected lipid membrane conductance mediated by valinomycin. The spermatozoa presented 49% and 47% of membrane dysfunction with PFOS and PFOA, respectively.

The LAB isolates were identified by sequencing of their 16S rRNA as belonging to four different genera of the Lactobacillaceae family: Lactiplantibacillus, Levilactobacillus, Lacticaseibacillus and Liquorilactobacillus, corresponding to the species plantarum, brevis, paracasei and ghanensis, respectively. Most of the strains showed resistance to high acidity (pH 2) and bile salts (0.5%), with survival rates up to 87 and 92%, respectively. In addition, most of the strains presented good antimicrobial activity against the foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, ECEC and Salmonella Typhi. The strain Liquorilactobacillus ghanensis RVG6, newly reported in pulque, presented an outstanding overall performance on the probiotic activity tests. In terms of their probiotic activity traits assessed in this work, the strains compared positively with the control L. acidophilus NCFM, which is a very-well documented probiotic strain. For the antimicrobial peptide studies, four strains presented bacteriocin-like mediated antibiosis and six had significant PGH activity, with two strains presenting outstanding overall antimicrobial peptide production: Lacticaseibacillus paracasei RVG3 and Levilactobacillus brevis UTMB2. The probiotic performance of the isolates was mainly dependent on strain specificity. The results obtained in this work can foster the revalorization of pulque as a functional natural product.;Antimicrobial peptides | Bacteriocins | Lactic acid bacteria | Peptidoglycan hydrolases | Pulque | Traditional fermented beverage;0;0;;;CONACYT;239567;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Among the alternatives proposed to improve conidia production, the use of packed column bioreactors allows controlled processes with higher levels of production and productivity than those obtained with the traditional process in plastic bags. However, problems associated with overheating, low CO2 removal, and inadequate oxygen supply in packed columns limit the scale-up and operation at an industrial scale. RESULTS: Packed densities, up to 1.5 times higher than those obtained in lab-scale column bioreactors, negatively affected growth and conidia production by Metarhizium robertsii (ENCB-MG-81). Therefore, a spherical-style packing was added to decrease packed density and improve the culture conditions in packed column bioreactors. The addition of spherical-style packing reduced the axial temperature gradient (up to 50%), increased the maximum CO2 production rate and the total CO2 production (up to 2.5 times), and enhanced the volumetric conidia productivity in packed column bioreactors from 5.28 ± 1.36 to 6.77 ± 0.89 × 108 conidia cm−3. CONCLUSION: The use of spherical-style packing within the culture bed in column bioreactors improves the production of conidia by Metarhizium robertsii, as well as the gas exchange and heat removal from the bed. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).;entomopathogenic fungus | forced aeration | heat removal | packed density | respirometric analysis;2;0;;;CONACYT;536865;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The aim was to estimate the prevalence and the characteristics of symptomatic axial OA in Spain. Methods: EPISER2016 is a cross-sectional multicenter population-based study of people aged 40 years or older. Subjects were randomly selected using multistage stratified cluster sampling. Participants were contacted by telephone to complete rheumatic disease screening questionnaires. Two phenotypes were analyzed, patients with Non-exclusive axial OA (NEA-OA) and Exclusive axial OA (EA-OA). To calculate the prevalence and its 95% confidence interval (CI), the sample design was considered and weighting was calculated according to age, sex and geographic origin. Results: Prevalence of NEA-OA by clinical or clinical-radiographic criteria was 19.17% (95% CI: 17.82–20.59). The frequency of NEA-OA increased with age (being 3.6 times more likely in patients aged 80 s or more than in those between 40 and 49 years) and body mass index. It was significantly more frequent in women, as well as in the center of Spain. It was less frequent in those with a higher level of education. Lumbar OA was more frequent than cervical OA. This difference grew with increasing age and was not associated with gender. It was also greater in overweight and obese subjects. Conclusions: This is the first study on the prevalence of axial OA phenotypes in Europe describing the associated socio-demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle variables.;Osteoarthritis | Phenotypes | Prevalence | Spine;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;ERDF;undefined;European Regional Development Fund

This EPS consists of glucose and galactose units, linked by β 1-4/6 bonds. The optimum temperature of EPS biosynthesis at pH 4.6 was 37°C (0.274 mg/mL of whey). Four different requesón formulations were prepared and analyzed in terms of texture properties and color. The addition of EPS increased the production yields, improved hardness, elasticity, and adhesiveness, and slightly decreased the L* component of color (luminosity). This study supports the utilization of acid whey wastes to obtain functional cheese such as requesón in which the EPS component can not only improve processing yields but also increase the values of hardness, elasticity and adhesiveness and slightly decrease luminosity of the product. Practical applications: In this manuscript, we show the feasibility of obtaining an acid whey cheese functionalized with exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced in situ by fermentation with Lactobacillus delbrueckii. The presence of EPS improved production yield, textural properties, and worked as a carrier for Lactobacillus paracasei (probiotic).;;2;0;;;ISTA;undefined;Institute of Science and Technology Austria

Current guidelines recommend measuring ER with indirect calorimetry (IC) when possible. Due to clinical settings, the use of simple formulas is preferred. Few studies have modeled equations for estimating ER for CKD. Nevertheless, variables of interest such as nutritional status and strength have not been explored in these models. This study aimed to develop and validate a model for estimating REE in patients with CKD stages 3–5, who were not receiving renal replacement therapy (RTT), using clinical variables and comparing it with indirect calorimetry as the gold standard. Methods: In this study 80 patients with CKD participated. Indirect calorimetry (IC) was performed in all patients. The calorimeter analyzed metabolic measurements every minute for 15 min after autocalibration with barometric pressure, temperature, and humidity. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) was performed. Fat-free mass (FFM) was registered among other bioelectrical components. Handgrip strength (HGS) was evaluated and an average of 3 repetitions was recorded. Nutritional status was assessed with the subjective global assessment (SGA). Patients categorized as B or C were then considered as having malnutrition. Results: We analyzed 71 patients and 3 models were generated. Model 1a included FFM; Model 2a included weight; Model 3c included handgrip strength (HGS). All other variables were stepwise, computer-selected with a p < 0.01 significance level; Malnutrition was consistently associated with ER among other clinical variables in all models (p < 0.05). The model that included BIA-FFM had R2adjusted = 0.46, while the model that included weight (Kg) had an adjusted R2adjusted = 0.44. The models had moderate concordance, LC = 0.60–0.65 with the gold standard, whereas other energy expenditure estimation equations had LC = 0.36 and 0.55 with indirect calorimetry. Using these previously validated equations as a reference, our models had concordance values ranging from 0.66 to 0.80 with them. Conclusion: Models incorporating nutritional status and other clinical variables such as weight, FFM, comorbidities, gender, and age have a moderate agreement with REE. The agreement between our models and others previously validated for the CKD patient is good; however, the agreement between the latter and IC measurements is moderate.

The aim of this study was to analyze the differences in species richness, composition, and vertical distribution of epiphytic angiosperms between areas with natural and disturbed forest at the Northern Coast of Jalisco state, Mexico. Methods: The presence/absence of epiphytic angiosperms was evaluated in each vertical zone of a selected tree, as well as those present in the understory, both in natural and disturbed sites in three types of vegetation (gallery forest, oak forest, tropical semideciduous forest) with a total of 30 plots of 20 m × 20 m in six sites. Alpha diversity was calculated for each site, as well as species turnover (beta diversity) between habitats. An analysis of variance was performed to determine if there was a significant difference in species richness between sites and, also to compare the height and diameter at breast height (DBH) of the host trees. Multivariate analyzes were used to group the sites according to their floristic composition. Furthermore, a linear regression was performed to detect any relationship between the number of species and the phorophyte structure. Results: We recorded 45 species, 29 genera and nine families of epiphytic angiosperms. The most diverse families were Bromeliaceae and Orchidaceae and the richest genus was Tillandsia. Although the disturbed sites had more species, a significant difference in richness was not found, except for the disturbed gallery forest. Epiphytic angiosperms presented a high beta diversity, since the sites shared only between 2 and 18% of the recorded species. The inner portion of the canopy (Z3 and Z4) hosted most of the species in all sites and the understory had a high representation of epiphytes except for the disturbed oak forest, where these were absent. A relationship between the DBH and the number of species was found only at the disturbed sites, however, it was highly influenced by the high number of taxa registered in disturbed gallery forest. Therefore, the size of the trees could not be considered a factor in determining the diversity of epiphyte species. Conclusion: The diversity of epiphytic angiosperm species from the North Coast of Jalisco has not been severely affected by the human disturbance. Most of the species have morphological and physiological adaptations that allow their establishment and survival in adverse climatic conditions. Our results suggest that epiphytic angiosperms cannot be considered as a good indicator for natural or disturbed environments in this region but should be considered in environmental conservation, as they present a high beta diversity.;beta diversity | bromeliads | disturbance | floristic composition | orchids;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the most widely used drugs worldwide and over the counter. The lack of legal norms that limit emission ranges in water bodies has been one of the main factors in the increase of these emerging pollutants (EC) in aquatic ecosystems. Studies based on the monitoring of these pharmaceutical compounds allow us to understand all aspects related to fate, concentration, distribution, effects, and physiological alterations that they cause in aquatic biota, for this reason, it is necessary to highlight the importance of bivalves as organisms, model and bioindicators. This review presents an overview of ecotoxicological studies that monitor NSAIDs and evaluates the responses of some species of bivalves in biomonitoring programs and toxicity tests. Negative effects of NSAIDs have been reported in aquatic environments to wild bivalves, in addition to causing biomagnification. With this study, it is expected to promote interest in scientific research in this little-explored area necessary for pharmacovigilance and biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems.;biomonitoring | concentrations | drugs | effects | water;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Mesquite is a shrubby legume that dominates the vegetation of arid regions with multiple benefits in controlling erosive process, improving micrometeorology, and as feed source for livestock species. In addition, mesquite pods contain secondary components that could represent an option to mitigate emissions of enteric methane in ruminants. Objective. To evaluate in vitro fermentation patterns and methane production of mesquite pods (Prosopis spp.) in the arid ecoregion of the State of Hidalgo. Methodology. Mesquite pod samples were obtained from four municipalities in the arid ecoregion of the state of Hidalgo: Actopan (ACT), Tula de Allende (TUL), San Salvador (SAL) and Zimapán (ZIM). In vitro fermentation of the mesquite pods was carried out during 72 h to 39 °C in a culture medium with ruminal bacteria and mineral solutions. The fractional gas volume (Vf), cumulated gas volume (Va), maximum volume (V), gas production rate (S) and lag time (L) were calculated. The volume of methane was quantified by displacement of a NaOH 2N solution. Results. Some chemical composition characteristics of the mesquite pods were different between municipalities. V showed significant differences between localities (p≤0.05), with mesquite pods collected in SAL showing the highest values (163.2 mL g-1 MS). A municipality x time interaction was observed for Vf (p≤0.05) and differences between municipalities were observed. The values of volume partial of CH4 observed at 24 hours were different between collection sites (p≤0.05), with higher emission values observed in mesquite pods collected in SAL (16.3 mL/g MS) and ACT (17.3 mL/g MS). Conclusion. The results of the current study provide evidence of differences of in vitro fermentation patterns and methane emissions from the mesquite pods regarding to origin place. Implications. These results should be considered in the design and implementation of future nutritional and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies.;rumen bacteria | ruminal degradation | Ruminal fermentation | ruminants | secondary components;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;SEP;UAEH-PTC-823;Secretaría de Educación Pública

Twenty-eight Pelibuey × Katahdin lambs (20.52 ± 0.88 kg body weight (BW)) were housed in individual pens and assigned to four treatments (n = 7) with different doses of PA: 0 (CON), 1 (PA1), 2 (PA2), and 3 (PA3) g of PA kg−1 of DM for 56 days. Compared to the CON, lambs in PA1 treatment had higher average daily gain (p = 0.03), higher dietary energy utilization (p = 0.01), greater backfat thickness (p = 0.02), greater Longissimus dorsi muscle area (p = 0.01), and better feed conversion ratio (p = 0.02). PA supplementation did not affect (p > 0.05) dry matter intake, carcass yield, biometric measures, and meat chemical composition. All hematological and most of the blood biochemical parameters were similar in lambs of all treatments (p > 0.05). However, compared to the CON, lambs assigned to the PA3 treatment had lower serum urea concentration (p = 0.05) and higher serum albumin concentration (p = 0.03). In conclusion, low doses of PA could be used as a growth promoter in finishing lambs without affecting dry matter intake, carcass yield, meat chemical composition, and health status of the lambs. However, more in vivo research is needed to better understand the impact of bioactive compounds from PA used on productivity, metabolism, and health status of finishing lambs.;bioactive compounds | growth promoters | hematological profile | meat composition;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) descriptors were used to establish a mathematical model to predict the corrosion inhibition efficiency (IE%) of several commercial drugs on steel surfaces. These descriptors were calculated through third-order density-functional tight binding (DFTB) methods. The mathematical modeling was carried out through autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) framework and tested by fivefold cross-validation. Another set of drugs was used as an external validation, obtaining SD, RMSE, and MSE, obtaining 6.76%, 3.89%, 7.03%, and 49.47%, respectively. With a predicted value of IE% = 87.51%, lidocaine was selected to perform a final comparison with experimental results. By the first time, this drug obtained a maximum IE%, determined experimentally by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements at 100 ppm concentration, of about 92.5%, which stands within limits of 1 SD from the predicted ARX model value. From the qualitative perspective, several potential trends have emerged from the estimated values. Among them, macrolides, alkaloids from Rauwolfia species, cephalosporin, and rifamycin antibiotics are expected to exhibit high IE% on steel surfaces. Additionally, IE% increases as the energy of HOMO decreases. The highest efficiency is obtained in case of the molecules with the highest ω and ∆N values. The most efficient drugs are found with pKa ranging from 1.70 to 9.46. The drugs recurrently exhibit aromatic rings, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups with the highest IE% values.;ARX model | corrosion inhibition | FROLS algorithm | lidocaine | lidocaine | QSAR | tight binding;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;ITESM;undefined;Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey

In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of E. coli and Salmonella spp. strains present in carnivores from Janos Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. These microorganisms had been isolated from a wide range of domestic and free-range animals, including wild carnivores. Fifty-five individuals were sampled, and the presence of Salmonella and E. coli was determined by bacteriological standard methods. Strains isolated were characterized by molecular methods and in vitro infection assays. Eight different species of carnivores were captured, including coyotes (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), desert foxes (Vulpes macrotis), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), hooded skunks (Mephitis macroura), lynxes (Lynx rufus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and badgers (Taxidea taxus). Salmonella spp. and E. coli were isolated from four species of carnivores. Five Salmonella spp. strains were isolated, and their molecular characterization revealed in three of them the presence of fimbrial and virulence genes associated with cell invasion. In vitro evaluation of these strains showed their capability to invade human Hep2 cells. Sixty-one E. coli strains were isolated; different serotypes and phylogroups were observed from these strains.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of orientation on diverse aspects of the reproductive biology of Myrtillocactus geometrizans. Phenology was studied in north- and south-facing branches. Floral cycle events, floral visitors, reproductive traits associated with sexual and attraction functions, and reproductive success were estimated from reproductive structures with contrasting orientation. Pollination experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of orientation on mating system. Our results showed that south-facing branches had a longer duration of the mature fruit phenophase. Moreover, flower synchrony, production of reproductive structures, and floral traits associated with the male (number of anthers and pollen grains per floral bud), female (number and size of ovules and dimensions of both ovary and ovary cavity), and attraction (petal size) functions had higher values in south-facing flowers. The beginning and ending of the male function and the end of flower anthesis occurred earlier in south-facing flowers. Diversity of floral visitors was similar between orientations, except for beetles whose abundance was greater in flowers oriented towards the south. North- and south-facing flowers had a mixed mating system, with similar reproductive success. Our results showed strong differences in the reproductive biology of an intertropical columnar cactus, probably in response to the uneven PAR interception and resource availability in branches and flowers with contrasting orientation.;floral cycle | floral traits | mating system | photosynthetic active radiation | reproductive phenology;0;0;;;CONACYT;143.05.27;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The aim of this study was to make a spatio-temporal characterization of Términos Lagoon (TL) using a multivariate approach enabling us to better understand the high variability of the system and to recognize underlying gradients. Five samplings were carried out at TL in a period of two years during which physicochemical variables were measured along 25 stations. A principal component analysis was made to analyze changes and interactions between variables in the lagoon, using the scores values at each station to represent the spatial variation for each component. The mapped scores allowed us to detect multivariate gradients generated by the variable interactions in the new components. Each sampling displayed multivariate gradients composed by the interaction of different variables correlated to the principal components. Our results allow us to recognize the processes occurring in TL that are responsible for these gradients. One of the main processes was freshwater discharge, whose influence was irregular. The multivariate gradients proposed evidenced the high variability that characterizes TL and, likely, coastal systems in general. We thus consider that the present methodological approach is adequate for modeling both spatial and time variations in a coastal system.;Brackish water environment | Environmental gradients | Estuaries | Principal component analysis (PCA) | Términos lagoon;0;0;;;IPN;undefined;Instituto Politécnico Nacional

However, this may represent an additional potential risk for kidney integrity, which is already compromised by the cholestatic process itself (cholemic nephropathy). Therefore, in the present work, we studied the renal damage caused by ANIT-induced cholestasis and whether it is aggravated or, on the contrary, counteracted by HGF; if the latter holds, the involvement of its antioxidant properties will be ascertained. ANIT-induced cholestatic deleterious renal effects were corroborated by the presence of urine bile salts, impairment of renal function, and the alterations of renal damage markers, such as HSP72, creatinine clearance, and albuminuria. HGF fully reverted all these, and the cast formation in the tubules was significantly decreased. These findings were associated with the control of renal oxidative stress. In summary, despite HGF enhancing the overload of potentially harmful biliary constituents that the kidney should remove from the bloodstream as an alternative depuration organ in cholestasis, it simultaneously protects the kidney from this damage by counteracting the prooxidant effects resulting from this harmful exposure.";Cholemic nephropathy | Cholestasis | HGF | Oxidative stress;0;0;;;CONACYT;280788;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Its fruit is marketed regionally but it contributes to the diversification of agricultural crops. To date, the studies about the quality of ripe fruits from cultivars with suitable characteristics to be commercialized are limited. In the present study, some physical and chemical characteristics were evaluated in fruit samples collected from 80 trees located in 16 states of the Mexican Republic. The basic data thus generated will allow the improvement of the postharvest handling practices of this fruit. Results indicated that the weight of the fruits fluctuated between 4.5 and 55 g while their dimensions did not show great variability (CV=17-18%). A great diversity of colors was found, from purple to yellow-green. Total soluble solids and titratable acidity ranged from 3.1 to 24.3% and from 0.1 to 2.3%, respectively. Among the sugars and organic acids, fructose and oxalic acid were present in the highest concentration followed by sucrose and glucose and tartaric and citric acid, respectively. The concentration of antioxidant compounds (phenolics, flavonoids, carotenoids and vitamin C) as well as the antioxidant activity, measured by DPPH, FRAP and ABTS methods, were higher in the peel than in the pulp.;antioxidant activity | carotenoids | color | phenolic compounds | vitamin C;0;0;;;;undefined;

In this study, fruits from the ecotypes 'Ticumán' and 'Del Campo' were harvested at the -ripe and -ripe stages of maturity, stored at room temperature (26±1°C; 50±5% RH), and evaluated periodically in accordance with different quality and physiological parameters. In both ecotypes, peak CO2 production occurred after 6 d; however, the highest rates were present in 'Del Campo'. Ethylene production was detected in 'Ticumán' only, with maximum values occurring 3 d after harvest. In both cultivars, firmness decreased after 2 d in fruits harvested at the -ripe stage and after 4 d in those harvested at the -ripe stage. Total soluble solids, on the other hand, ranged from 6.1 to 14% regardless of the ecotype or stage of maturity at harvest.

There is evidence of the interaction between the gut microbiota metabolic regulation, and obesity. The global problem of obesity has prompted the study of new preventive and/or therapeutic proposals. Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is projected as a possible treatment for obesity and its associated comorbidities. The objective of this study is to synthesize the current documentation that exists on the effect in metabolic and clinical parameters produced by FMT in humans with obesity, as well as to make evident the methodology used in FMT. Primary results indicated the existence of significant changes in the composition of gut microbiota and improvement in some metabolic markers such as a decrease in insulin resistance (IR) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), as well as an increase in high-density cholesterol (HDL). Further changed were noted in clinical markers such as the decrease in body mass index and waist circumference. Secondary results supported the need to standardize the experimental design of FMT, starting with establishing the correct selection of donors to determine the long-term follow-up of FMT. In conclusion, even though there is a limited number of studies and a lack of standardization on the methodology to carry out FMT, some positive metabolic associations have been shown, which is why FMT remains a potentially promising option for treatment adjuvant of obesity.;Fecal donors | Fecal microbiota transplant | Metabolic syndrome | Obesity | Obesogenic gut microbiota;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Exhibiting animals in circuses continues to be a popular practice today in some countries such as Germany, Spain, or Australia. However, animals' biological needs are not always prioritized due to the inadequate diets, reduced housing spaces, deficient social interaction, and handling that predisposes them to develop stereotypies and alter mental states due to chronic stress. Animal circuses are considered a controversial practice that can decrease the welfare of animals. Understanding the possible negative consequences on animal welfare (mental state and physical health) could contribute to planning strategies to improve the quality of life of wildlife animals exhibited in circuses worldwide.;animal ethics | keeper-animal relationships | mental alteration | pathological behaviors | stereotypies;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The present review article analyzes the frequency of skin injuries suffered by water buffaloes during transport and several key contributing factors. It also discusses the consequences of injuries on the quality of carcasses. Important aspects identified include inappropriate vehicle design that does not comply with the dimensions recommended by international institutions (e.g., height, type of flooring, characteristics of the ramp), handling methods, and the ability of stockpeople to manage water buffaloes, all of which impact the incidence of injuries. Our analysis of these elements will contribute to identifying critical control points and areas of opportunity while also suggesting strategies to ensure the welfare of these animals during transport and the quality of water buffalo products and by-products.;animal welfare | antemortem | bruises | carcass | injuries | transport;1;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The B.1.1.7 lineage was first detected in Mexico during December 2020, showing a slow progressive increase in its circulation frequency, which reached its maximum in May 2021 but never became predominant. In this work, we analyzed the patterns of diversity and distribution of this lineage in Mexico using phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses. Despite the reported increase in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 lineage, in most Mexican states, it did not displace cocirculating lineages, such as B.1.1.519, which dominated the country from February to May 2021. Our results show that the states with the highest prevalence of B.1.1.7 were those at the Mexico-U.S. border. An apparent pattern of dispersion of this lineage from the northern states of Mexico toward the center or the southeast was observed in the largest transmission chains, indicating possible independent introduction events from the United States. However, other entry points cannot be excluded, as shown by multiple introduction events. Local transmission led to a few successful haplotypes with a localized distribution and specific mutations indicating sustained community transmission.;Alpha | genomic surveillance | Mexico | SARS-CoV-2;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;UM;PP-F003;University of Miami

Evaluation of sex-and hormone-dependent changes in body weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, oxidative stress markers, and alterations in different types of memory in Sprague–Dawley rats fed with a high fat and high fructose (HFHF) diet were evaluated. After 12 weeks of feeding the male and female rats with HFHF, body weight gain, increase in blood pressure, and generation of dyslipidemia compared to the animals fed with chow diet were observed. Regarding memory, it was noted that gonadectomy reverted the effects of HFHF in the 24 h novel object recognition task and in spatial learning/memory analyzed through Morris water maze, males being more affected than females. Nevertheless, gonadectomy did not revert long-term memory impairment in the passive avoidance task induced by HFHF nor in male or female rats. On the other hand, sex-hormone–diet interaction was observed in the plasma concentration of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide. These results suggest that the changes observed in the memory and learning of MetS animals are sex-and hormone-dependent and correlate to an increase in oxidative stress.;memory | metabolic syndrome | orchiectomy | ovariectomy | oxidative stress;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Specifically, we first model, simulate, validate, and calibrate the behavior of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cancer-related signaling pathway. Subsequently, once the behavior of the simulated signaling network matches the expected behavior, the capacity of the computational simulation is increased to grow data (data farming). First, we use big data techniques to extract, collect, filter, and store large volumes of data describing all the interactions among the simulated cell signaling system components over time. Afterward, we apply data mining and machine learning techniques—specifically, exploratory data analysis, feature selection techniques, and supervised neural network models—to the resulting biological dataset to obtain new inferences and knowledge about this biological system. The results showed how the traditional approach to the simulation of biological systems could be enhanced and improved by incorporating big data, data mining, and machine learning techniques, which significantly contributed to increasing the predictive power of the simulation.;Big data techniques | cell signaling networks | machine learning techniques | modeling and simulation approach | predictive analytics;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Animal cruelty encompasses any act that causes a non-human animal unnecessary pain or suffering, including negligence, abandonment, abuse, torture, bestiality, and even theriocide. This represents a red flag for society as a whole because people who commit such acts can escalate violence and direct it to other individuals. Animal cruelty and interpersonal violence—as well as other socially undesirable conduct such as bullying, antisocial personality disorder, rape, and serial murder—are closely related, so timely diagnoses of either one can help prevent acts of aggression. It is necessary, therefore, to analyze and try to understand whether there are early indicators that may help identify potentially violent individuals. It is well known that kids from homes with actual violence in their homes show a high tendency to reproduce such behaviors with both animals and other people. In conclusion, much research and rethinking of the importance of the veterinarian in detecting animal abuse and cruelty is needed to help detect and prevent cases of interpersonal violence that may arise over time.;animal cruelty | animal welfare | one welfare | the link | veterinary social work | violence;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Behavior is the expression of several physiological, endocrine, motor and emotional responses that are coordinated by the central nervous system from the processing of internal and external stimuli. In mammals, seven basic emotional systems have been described that when activated by the right stimuli evoke positive or negative innate responses that evolved to facilitate biological fitness. This review describes the process of how those neurobiological systems can directly influence animal welfare. We also describe examples of the interaction between primary (innate) and secondary (learned) processes that influence behavior.;emotions | learning | neurobiology | Panksepp | welfare | well-being;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

However, it may not be necessary to measure the LCA from the first surface of the cornea to the retina, as it is known that most of the changes that can modify the path of light occur from the first surface of the cornea to the last surface of the crystalline lens. This investigation presents the study of an objective technique that allows the measurement of longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) on the last crystalline lens surface by developing a pulse width wavefront system using a Hartmann test, Purkinje image, and Zernike polynomial. A blue pulse (440–480 nm) and a red pulse (580–640 nm) were used to generate a pattern of spots in the human eye. This pattern generated on the posterior surface of the crystalline lens of the human eye allows the reconstruction of the wavefront via a modal method with Zernike polynomials. Once the wavefront is reconstructed, Zernike coefficients can be used to quantify the LCA. The methodology and objective measurements of the magnitude of the longitudinal chromatic aberration of five test subjects are explained in this article.;chromatic aberration | Hartmann test | longitudinal chromatic aberrations | Purkinje image detection | Purkinje images | Zernike polynomials;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

This study aimed to assess the effects of a long-term moderate aerobic exercise protocol on bone microarchitecture and fragility associated with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in aging. Male BALB/c mice (n = 10 per group) underwent a moderate exercise protocol from 13 weeks to 27 (adulthood age) or 108 weeks of age (elderly age) and were then sacrificed. Age-match sedentary mice were included as a control group. Serum cortisol concentrations were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay, C-reactive protein (CRP) by a turbidimetric assay, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) by fluorescent spectroscopy, and total glutathione (GSH) by colorimetric method. The right femur was dissected for morphometric and densitometric analysis by computerized microtomography (µCT), and biomechanical properties were assessed using a three-point bending device. Muscle from the same extremity was obtained to determine relative mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) by RT-qPCR. Statistical differences were evaluated by two-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak method post hoc with P < 0.05. In elderly mice, moderate exercise increased glutathione levels and microarchitecture complexity but decreased bone fragility and oxidative stress markers, cortisol, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, these results suggest a strong link between a pro-inflammatory state and age-conditioned oxidative stress on bone quality. Thus, on a human scale, moderate aerobic exercise may improve bone quality during aging.;Aging | Inflammation | Moderate exercise | Oxide-reduction system | Quality bone;0;0;;;CONACYT;176060;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Among the devices that use magnetic fields generated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging is Quantum Magnetic Resonance Therapy (QMRT). Methods: Five children diagnosed with DBG in our institution in Mexico City underwent treatment of compassionate use with QMRT between December 2018 and July 2019. A survival analysis was performed with previously reported historical data (n = 15). Results: Two patients (40%) survived after three years of follow-up; the log-rank test showed a statistically significant difference in overall survival between both groups (p = 0.032). All patients tolerated the treatment adequately without reporting any severe clinical or neuroradiological adverse effects. Of the patients included, all showed a decrease in the tumor one month after the end of the treatment, although there was great variability in the response and the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Conclusions: Although future investigations are needed to confirm the findings reported in the present study, the improvement in survival is promising for a group of patients whose prognosis has been catastrophic over the years.

For this, a revision of the conservation and training programs was carried out, 209 household surveys were applied, and 15 key stakeholders were interviewed. The adaptive capacity index (ACI), made up of 7 determinants and 40 indicators, shows significant differences in the adaptive capacity (AC) of localities analyzed inside and outside the PCBR. These differences can be attributed to social factors, information, and competence at the community, institutional, and human determinants. The results of this research suggest that decision-makers should encourage policies that promote AC in the studied localities to strengthen the determinants with low values in the institutional, human, and economic aspects.;Adaptation | Coastal-marine ecosystems | Extreme hydro-meteorological events | Protected areas;1;0;;;CONACYT;402149;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Increasing concerns about human health and environmental protection have driven the application of biological control techniques that can inhibit fungal contaminants. In this study, the growth inhibition of the ochratoxigenic fungus Aspergillus carbonarius Ac 162 was evaluated using 5 lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The LAB studied were Lactobacillus plantarum MZ801739 (J), Lactobacillus plantarum MZ809351 (31) and Lactobacillus plantarum MZ809350 (34), isolated in the Ivory Coast, and Lactobacillus plantarum MN982928 (3) and Leuconostoc citreum MZ801735 (23), isolated in Mexico. J, 31, 34, 3 and 23 are the internal strain codes from our laboratory. LAB were cultivated in De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) broth, and different polyols (glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol) were added to the culture broth to stimulate the production of antifungal compounds. The fungal inhibition studies were performed using the poisoned food technique. The highest inhibition of A. carbonarius growth was obtained by cultivating L. plantarum MZ809351 in the presence of xylitol and glycerol. Under these conditions, 1 L of the L. plantarum MZ809351 cultures were used to identify antifungal compounds. The compounds were concentrated by solid-phase extraction and then characterized by GC–MS. In addition to 9-octadecenoic acid, 3 diketopiperazines or cyclic dipeptides were identified, including cyclo (Leu-Leu), cyclo (Pro-Gly) and cyclo (Val-Phe), which were compounds related to microbial antifungal activities. Xylitol and glycerol induced the production of these antifungal compounds against A. carbonarius Ac 162. On the other hand, adding xylitol and glycerol to the MRS broth reduced the Ochratoxin A (OTA) content to 56.8 and 54.7%, respectively. This study shows the potential for using L. plantarum MZ809351 as a biocontrol agent to prevent the growth of A. carbonarius and reduce the production of OTA in foods.;;0;0;;;ANR;613157;Agence Nationale de la Recherche

However, biocrust research in Mexico have also increased in the last two decades. Mexico has deserts (Chihuahuan and Sonoran) and semideserts (Querétaro and Tehuacán) with particular environmental characteristics that likely have different effects on biocrust structure and function. We synthesize studies on biocrusts performed in Mexican deserts and semideserts in the last 24 years to describe their species composition, ecology, and ecosystem function, and to identify new lines of research. Biocrusts are composed by 52 genera and 148 species of algae, fungi, cyanobacteria, lichens, and mosses, some of which are new records for biocrust diversity worldwide. Biocrust composition and distribution is determined by soil properties, vegetation cover, and geological history. However, biocrusts in the Tehuacán semidesert differ in their composition from biocrusts in other Mexican and American deserts. Biocrusts have opposite effects on germination, seedling survival and growth, and on soil invertebrate diversity. Moreover, biocrusts have opposite effects on infiltration, although biocrusts increase soil stability. Biocrusts contribute to soil nutrient dynamics and may form fertility mantles that regulate soil fertility. However, grazing, rainfed agriculture, and firewood extraction alter biocrust structure and function. Even though biocrusts are essential in the Mexican deserts and semideserts, there are still information gaps in the understanding of biocrusts such as the biological conservation of biocrust species, the utility of biocrusts to restore degraded soils, and the effect of global change on the structure and function of biocrusts.;Biological soil crusts | Germination and seedling survival | Infiltration rate and soil stability | Soil C and N dynamics | Xeric shrubland;2;0;;;;undefined;

No other medical advance has ever had the same impact in the clinical practise. The fungus Penicillium chrysogenum (reclassified as P. rubens) has been used for industrial production of penicillin ever since the forties of the past century; industrial biotechnology developed hand in hand with it, and currently P. chrysogenum is a thoroughly studied model for secondary metabolite production and regulation. In addition to its role as penicillin producer, recent synthetic biology advances have put P. chrysogenum on the path to become a cell factory for the production of metabolites with biotechnological interest. In this review, we tell the history of P. chrysogenum, from the discovery of penicillin and the first isolation of strains with high production capacity to the most recent research advances with the fungus. We will describe how classical strain improvement programs achieved the goal of increasing production and how the development of different molecular tools allowed further improvements. The discovery of the penicillin gene cluster, the origin of the penicillin genes, the regulation of penicillin production, and a compilation of other P. chrysogenum secondary metabolites will also be covered and updated in this work.";classical strain improvement | penicillin | penicillin historical development | Penicillium chrysogenum | Penicillium rubens | phylogeny of penicillin genes | secondary metabolism | synthetic biology | transcriptional regulation;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;CB-2013-01 222207;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In this work, we present a model of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which plays a key role in cell cycle regulation and is related to cell survival, proliferation, and growth in cancer, as well as resistance to antitumor therapies, so finding drugs that act on this pathway is ideal to propose a new adjuvant treatment. The aim of this work was to model, simulate and predict in silico using the Big Data-Cellulat platform the possible targets in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway on which the Opuntia joconostle extract acts, as well as to indicate the concentration range to be used to find the mean lethal dose in in vitro experiments on breast cancer cells. The in silico results show that, in a cancer cell, the activation of JAK and STAT, as well as PI3K and Akt is related to the effect of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis, and that the extract of O. joconostle has an antiproliferative effect on breast cancer cells by inhibiting cell proliferation, regulating the cell cycle and inhibiting apoptosis through this signaling pathway. In vitro it was demonstrated that the extract shows an antiproliferative effect, causing the arrest of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of in silico tools is a valuable method to perform virtual experiments and discover new treatments. The use of this type of model supports in vitro experimentation, reducing the costs and number of experiments in the real laboratory.;breast cancer | cell signaling pathways | in silico prediction | in vitro evaluation | Modeling and simulation;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;UAM;undefined;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

In this protocol, the three-dimensional architecture of a pancreatic islet is firstly reconstructed from experimental data using a novel computational algorithm. Next, the morphological and connectivity properties of the reconstructed islet, such as the number and percentages of the different type of cells, cellular volume, and cell-to-cell contacts, are obtained. Then, network theory is used to describe the connectivity properties of the islet through network-derived metrics such as average degree, clustering coefficient, density, diameter, and efficiency. Finally, all these properties are functionally evaluated through computational simulations using a model of coupled oscillators. Overall, here we describe a step-by-step workflow, implemented in IsletLab, a multiplatform application developed specifically for the study and simulation of pancreatic islets, to apply a novel computational methodology to characterize and analyze pancreatic islets as a complement to the experimental work.;;1;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

However, evidence of the effectiveness of the thermal windows used in dogs and cats is discrepant. This review aims to analyze and discuss the usefulness of IRT in diverse body regions in household animals (pets) related to recent scientific evidence on the use of the facial, body, and appendicular thermal windows. IRT is a diagnostic method that evaluates thermal and circulatory changes under different clinical conditions. For the face, structures such as the lacrimal caruncle, ocular area, and pinna are sensitive to assessments of stress degrees, but only the ocular window has been validated in felines. The usefulness of body and appendicular thermal windows has not been conclusively demonstrated because evidence indicates that biological and environmental factors may strongly influence thermal responses in those body regions. The above has led to proposals to evaluate specific muscles that receive high circulation, such as the biceps femoris and gracilis. The neck area, perivulvar, and perianal regions may also prove to be useful thermal windows, but their degree of statistical reliability must be established. In conclusion, IRT is a non-invasive technique that can be used to diagnose inflammatory and neoplastic conditions early. However, additional research is required to establish the sensitivity and specificity of these thermal windows and validate their clinical use in dogs and cats.;Cats | Dogs | Infrared thermography | Thermal window;9;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The rats were distributed in three groups: control, CR at 15%, and CR at 35% for 6 (up to 18 months of age) and 12 months (up to 24 months of age). At the end of CR treatment, we evaluated reproductive (male sexual behavior (MSB), sperm quality) and biochemical parameters (plasma glucose, glucose-regulating hormone, and sex steroid levels), and quantified annexin V in the seminiferous epithelium. Results showed that MSB and sperm quality were improved after 6 months of CR associated with increases in plasma testosterone and decrease annexin V in the seminiferous epithelium of the testicles compared to their control group. The metabolic profile of the CR rats also improved compared to controls. However, these effects of CR on reproductive parameters were not maintained after 12 months of CR. Findings suggest that beginning CR at the age of maturity reestablishes the behavioral sexual response and reproductive function in older animals after 6 months of CR and improves endocrine functioning during aging.;Calorie restriction | Male sexual behavior | Seminiferous tubules | Testis | Testosterone;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;718777;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The information was obtained from three FMPs, considering the silvicultural regimes, the original stand or sub-stand structure, and the species that promoted cutting regeneration. These FMPs represent different management periods; the forest inventory of the first FMP indicates the condition of the forest originated under state control, while the two subsequent ones evaluate the condition of the forest under community forestry. Sub-stand variables of the three FMPs were compared using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test. The results indicated that, in the first FMP, the sub-stands were of old growth, and intensive thinning was applied. In the two subsequent plans, alternate strip clearcutting and single-tree selection were implemented. It was shown that, with increased management intensity in the sub-stands, better characteristics were obtained in terms of increment in basal area and volume variables, promoting regeneration and establishment of Pinus and displacing dominance of Quercus genus, without affecting forest richness and diversity.";Community forestry | Conservation | Forest management | Forests | Kruskal–Wallis test | Land use | Productivity | Silvicultural regimes | Trees;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

It includes a broad literature review emphasizing the most recent and specialized publications examining key findings to improve our understanding in the performance of the buffalo species (Bubalus bubalis). The complementary topics addressed include reproductive management, parturition, the dam–calf bond, milking routines, and models of confinement and management, in addition to aspects related to milk commercialization. This article summarizes the advances made to date in this production system and its current margins for improvement. The development of dual-purpose water buffalo production systems in Mexico’s tropical wetlands is a relatively recent phenomenon that has progressed and improved due to herd management. Buffaloes are an interesting alternative for dual purpose systems that offer several advantages. The lower milk production of this species compared to cattle is its main limitation. However, the properties of their milk allow one to obtain an added value and make this type of farms competitive. In synthesis, consolidating buffalo production in Mexico’s tropical wetlands will require broadening our knowledge of this species, and perfecting the most appropriate handling procedures. The activities of government agencies and processing enterprises will play vital roles in achieving the integral modernization of this potentially important economic activity.;Allosuckling | Bubalus bubalis | Calving | Imprinting | Mexico wetlands;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Microencapsulation offers advantages such as facilitating handling and control of the release and solubilization of active substances, thus offering a great area for food science and processing development. For instance, the development of functional food products, fat reduction, sensory improvement, preservation, and other areas may involve the use of microcapsules in various food matrices such as meat products, dairy products, cereals, and fruits, as well as in their derivatives, with good results. The versatility of applications arises from the diversity of techniques and materials used in the process of microencapsulation. The objective of this review is to report the state of the art in the application and evaluation of microcapsules in various food matrices, as a one-microcapsule-core system may offer different results according to the medium in which it is used. The inclusion of micro-capsules produces functional products that include probiotics and prebiotics, as well as antioxidants, fatty acids, and minerals. Our main finding was that the microencapsulation of polyphenolic extracts, bacteriocins, and other natural antimicrobials from various sources that inhibit microbial growth could be used for food preservation. Finally, in terms of sensory aspects, microcapsules that mimic fat can function as fat replacers, reducing the textural changes in the product as well as ensuring flavor stability.;Fat substitute | Functional food | Microencapsulation | Preservatives | Sensory improvement;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Among these, MEL binds to calmodulin (CaM) with high affinity. In presence of Ca2+, CaM binds to CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). The Ca2+-CaM/CaMKII pathway regulates a myriad of brain functions in different cellular compartments. Evidence showing the regulation of this cellular pathway by MEL is scarce. Thus, our main objective was to study the interaction of MEL with CaM and its effects on CaMKII activity in two microenvironments (aqueous and lipidic) naturally occurring within the cell. In addition, colocalization of MEL with CaM in vivo was explored in mice brain hippocampus. In vitro CaM-MEL interaction and the structural conformations of CaM in the presence of this indoleamine were assessed through electrophoretic mobility and isoelectric point. The functional consequence of this interaction was evaluated by measuring CaMKII activity. Ca2+-CaM-MEL increased the activity of CaMKII in aqueous buffer but reduced the kinase activity in lipid buffer. Importantly, MEL colocalizes in vivo with Ca2+-CaM in the hippocampus. Our evidence suggests that MEL regulates the key cellular Ca2+-CaM/CaMKII pathway and might explain why physiological MEL concentrations reduce CaMKII activity in some experimental conditions, while in others it drives biological processes through activation of this kinase.;Calmodulin | Calmodulin kinase II | Colocalization | Hippocampus | Melatonin;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;290526;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Social media has become a common way of exchanging information; therefore, we proposed to use it as a tool for exploring beer-food pairing and eating behavior. Twitter and Instagram were selected as they are among the most popular platforms. Although texts from Twitter could provide an accurate verbal description of consumer's food experiences, Instagram could offer the possibility of exploring the consumption context through images, leading to a better understanding of consumers' eating behavior, with a focus on food and beverage combinations. We hypothesize that images from Instagram will provide further information than texts from Twitter, regarding beer-food pairing and consumption context. A social media study was performed in Mexico comparing texts vs. images, selected from a one-year period, and manually classified through content analysis. Foods extracted from images and texts were categorized into frequencies and analyzed using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and hierarchical clustering (AHC). MCA showed the most frequently mentioned foods paired with beer for each platform. Data extracted from images and texts about consumption context was also analyzed and categorized into frequencies according to several themes: consumption behavior, type of consumption, way of beer consumption, place of consumption, and consumption occasion. Data extracted from the two platforms was compared by using a chi-square test per theme. Several differences were found, depending on the social media platform, texts being the one with less extracted and meaningful information. In general, while texts provided less extracted and meaningful information, images offered more details regarding beer-food pairing and context of consumption, the same as beer information such as type, color, brand, and style. Overall, images gave more information on beer-food pairing compared to texts. The methods and results from this paper could be applied by culinary professionals, sommeliers, and researchers in the gastronomy and food and hospitality areas.";Beer | Context of consumption | Food pairing | Instagram | Social media | Twitter;1;0;;;CONACYT;314318;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The information obtained from 64 interviews with members of the six cooperatives that operate in the study area revealed how the Mexican civil association that promoted this certification initiative placed its own economic interests above conservationist arguments, and how its actions generated problems by (i) excluding diverse local fishers from the design and instrumentation of the certification, and (ii) producing unequal economic benefits for the organizations and localities where this activity is practiced. The study demonstrates that fishing certifications proposed from the Global South (Southern Certifications) can reproduce problems of legitimacy similar to those that conventional certifications (pragmatic legitimacy) confront, with scant benefits for small-scale, artisanal fisheries in developing countries. We conclude that constructing moral (i.e., a balance between strong and weak networks) and cognitive (i.e., sociocultural proximity) legitimacy is crucial for instrumenting certifications that will be more effective in attending to the socioeconomic and environmental challenges of fishing in specific territorial contexts.;Cognitive legitimacy | Local participation | Moral legitimacy | Pragmatic legitimacy | Southern environmental certifications | Territoriality;1;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

A limitation to producing maguey seedlings is the low availability of organic substrates that favor plant adaptation in the field. The objective was to evaluate the effect of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) found in substrates in response to vegetative and root growth of A. salmiana in agricultural areas of Huichapan, Hidalgo, Mexico. The treatment consisted of earthworm humus (EH) and leaf compost (LC) substrates with materials from the region with different percentages of EH (100, 75, 50%), LC (5, 10%), and sand (20, 40%). The treatments were applied with 14 random replications in two phases in seeds and 40-day-seedlings. The variables evaluated were NPK amount and pH in substrates. The physiological variables measured were plant height, leaf number, stem diameter, root length, and volume. Significant differences (P≤0.05) were observed in seedling physiology due to the effect of the treatment. The best agronomic responses (plant growth and root length/weight) of Agave seedlings were T5 (75% earthworm humus + 20% sand + 5% leaf-soil) and T6 (50% earthworm humus + 40% sand + 10% leaf-soil); in both treatments, the NPK percentages were different from the control (Haplic Phaeozem soil) group. The final concentration of NPK in T6 was N = 0.04%, P = 398.13 mg Kg-1 and K = 11.88 meq 100g-1 . The results infer that NPK availability in soil and progressive acidification (initial pH = 8.6, final pH = 7.4) of the substrate can favorably influence the plant response. The interactions between NPK availability in the substrate and their use for a better response in maguey seedling adaptability open up new lines of research on the productive systems in the region of Huichapan, Hidalgo, Mexico.";maguey | nutritional quality | plant physiology | productive soils | seedling;0;0;;;;undefined;

Short-term HRV time series are of great clinical interest to study autonomic impairments manifested in chronic diseases such as the end stage renal disease (ESRD) and the response of patients to treatment with hemodialysis (HD). In contrast to Iterative Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform (IAAFT), the Pinned Wavelet Iterative Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform (PWIAAFT) surrogates preserve nonstationary behavior in time series, a common characteristic of HRV. We aimed to test synthetic data and HRV time series for the existence of nonlinearity. Recurrence Quantitative Analysis (RQA) indices were used as discriminative statistics in IAAFT and PWIAAFT surrogates of linear stationary and nonstationary processes. HRV time series of healthy subjects and 29 ESRD patients before and after HD were tested in this setting during an active standing test. Contrary to PWIAAFT, linear nonstationary time series may be erroneously regarded as nonlinear according to the IAAFT surrogates. Here, a lower proportion of HRV time series was classified as nonlinear with PWIAAFT, compared to IAAFT, confirming that the nonstationarity condition influences the testing of nonlinear behavior in HRV. A contribution of nonlinearity was found in the HRV data of healthy individuals. A lower proportion of nonlinear time series was also found in ESRD patients, but statistical significance was not found. Although this proportion tends to be lower in ESRD patients, as much as 60% of time series proved to be nonlinear in healthy subjects. Given the important contribution of nonlinearity in HRV data, a nonlinear point of view is required to achieve a broader understanding of cardiovascular physiology.;active standing | heart rate variability | hemodialysis | nonlinear dynamics | nonstationarity | recurrence analysis | surrogate data;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;DGAPA PAPIIT IN216318;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy is the clinical manifestation of hypoxic injury to the brain and is usually graded as mild, moderate, or severe. The search for useful biomarkers to precisely predict the severity of lesions in perinatal asphyxia and hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a field of increasing interest. As pathophysiology is not fully comprehended, the gold standard for treatment remains an active area of research. Hypothermia has proven to be an effective neuroprotective strategy and has been implemented in clinical routine. Current studies are exploring various add-on therapies, including erythropoietin, xenon, topiramate, melatonin, and stem cells. This review aims to perform an updated integration of the pathophysiological processes after perinatal asphyxia in humans and animal models to allow us to answer some questions and provide an interim update on progress in this field.;Brain injury | Human and animal models | Hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy | Meconium aspiration syndrome | Perinatal asphyxia;5;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The differences between species, forms of management and regions were estimated with a Nested ANOVA. A Multiple Correlation Analysis was followed between all traits at the species level and forms of management within each species. We found differences in mean values between species, forms of management and regions. Significant correlations between damage, defense strategies and fitness were detected in both species and forms of management, some of them concordant with domestication syndrome: More damage/less resistance, or more damage/more branching rate. Our results suggest that S. pruinosus evolved a tolerance response under human management, while S. stellatus has not modified any of them through the same process.

They sense and respond to physiological and environmental changes of their host plant and microbiome. The inter-organism interactions are largely driven by chemical networks mediated by specialized metabolites. The balance of these complex interactions leads to healthy and strong host plants. Endophytic strains have particular machinery to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites with a variety of bioactivities and unknown functions in an ecological niche. Terpenoids play a key role in endophytism and represent an important source of bioactive molecules for human health and agriculture. In this review, we describe the role of endophytic fungi in plant health, fungal terpenoids in multiple interactions, and bioactive fungal terpenoids recently reported from endophytes, mainly from plants used in traditional medicine, as well as from algae and mangroves. Additionally, we highlight endophytic fungi as producers of important chemotherapeutic terpenoids, initially discovered in plants. Despite advances in understanding endophytism, we still have much to learn in this field. The study of the role, the evolution of interactions of endophytic fungi and their terpenoids provide an opportunity for better applications in human health and agriculture.;Bioactivity | Chemotherapeutic | Endophytic fungi | Endophytism | Terpenoids;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;375987;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

If maintenance actions are not taken after scouring events, the scour depth increases over time until the bridge collapses. A methodology to estimate the scour hazard considering both the scour–fill interaction and the Monte Carlo simulation method is proposed. The general extreme value probability distribution is used to characterize the intensity of the scouring events, the lognormal distribution is used to characterize the sedimentation process (fill), and a homogeneous Poisson process is used to forecast the occurrence of both types of events. Based on the above, several histories of scour–fill depths are made; such simulations are then used to develop time-dependent scour hazard curves.

The study was carried out in two main stages. First, the sensory appeal of a nopal beverage was evaluated before and after tasting with expected and actual sensory characterization, respectively, distributed into three different groups: Control, Advantages, and Inconveniences. Secondly, a Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ) was applied to learn more about expectations, experiences, and emotions involved in the food pattern of this population. The expected sensory properties for the Inconveniences group showed the lowest grades for all variables, mainly compared to the Advantages group, which showed a difference of 21.98% for nutritious, 16.47% for overall liking, and 55.13% for acceptance. However, after tasting in the Inconveniences group, the acceptance changed from “I would hardly ever eat this” to “I would frequently eat this”. In a similar way, the overall liking had an increase of 25.35% from before to after tasting. The interrelationship between the socio-economic characteristics and the treatments revealed significant effects for education level, household income, and gender on the beverage acceptance. The Multiple Factor Analysis showed how socio-demographic aspects impact emotions. For the majority of participants, the attribute they are most concerned about when choosing a food is that it needs to fill them (satisfy their hunger). Therefore, this is the first study of its kind in Brazil, and the results provide good insights on factors that influence food choices of low-income and food-insecure Brazilian potential consumers.;Cactus | Emotions | Food Choice Questionnaire | Product information | Sensory analysis | Unfamiliar food;1;0;;;CAPES;CAPES/PROEX 1734/2015;Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

The objectives were to obtain a broader profile of this system and capture values related to buffalo breeding in that area. The study identified a group of producers with high levels of education (17 ± 1.15 years) and years of experience i n agricultural systems (28.75 ± 10.81), especially with buffaloes (9 ± 1.83 years). Land tenure is private, and the average surface area of ranches is 428.75 ± 245.57 hectares, located mainly (92%) in flatlands and floodplains with an average number of animals per hectare 2.03 ± 0.69 AU/h. The area has various vegetable strata (grasses, bushes, trees). Feeding is based on the consumption of vegetable species like Camalote grass (Paspalum fasciculatum), West Indian Azuche grass (Hymenachne amplexicaulis), and Aleman grass (Echinochloa polystachya), complemented with minerals. Production units (PU) 2 and 3 add a low proportion of balanced feed. The average number of animals per PU is 611 ± 50. Dams and calves represent the largest proportions in the herds. The main breed raised in these buffalo production systems is Buffalypso (58% ± 21%), followed by Italian Mediterranean (24% ± 5%) and Murrah (10% ± 14%). The data collected show that the reproduction methods most often utilized, in order of frequency, are fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI), direct mounting (DM), and estrus-detected artificial insemination (EDAI). Proportions are 61% ± 18%, 24% ± 25% and 14% ± 17%, respectively. The DPBPS studied are distinguished by the presence of owners and managers with high levels of education, extensive experience in agricultural systems, and the capacity and willingness to implement new technologies that permit continuous improvement. However, their experience in buffalo production is still limited, so there is ample room for improvement.;Bubalus bubalis | production system | River buffalo | tropical wetlands;1;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

However, the effect of land use on biocrusts has not been evaluated in tropical semiarid regions. This study evaluated the effect of rainfed agriculture and firewood extraction on the taxonomic and functional structure of biocrusts in a tropical semiarid region of Central Mexico. We collected biocrusts in sites of rainfed agriculture and firewood extraction to identify species by morphology and then, to count the number of species and to estimate the cover of total biocrust, taxonomic groups (cyanobacteria, lichens, and bryophytes), and functional groups (cyanobacteria with and without heterocysts, chlorolichens, cyanolichens, and bryophytes). In addition, we analyzed the relationship between the cover of total biocrust, taxonomic, and functional groups, and vegetation and soil traits of sites of rainfed agriculture and firewood extraction. In sites of rainfed agriculture, biocrusts had 14–18 species, with 50–70% cover, and were dominated by cyanobacteria with heterocysts. Biocrusts were associated with high bare soil cover and compact soil with a high pH. In sites of firewood extraction, biocrusts had 23–29 species, with 70–90% cover, and were dominated by cyanolichens and bryophytes. Biocrusts were associated with soils with high infiltration and nutrient content. These differences suggest that rainfed agriculture has negative effects on biocrusts, similar to the effects of livestock production and irrigation agriculture in temperate arid regions. In comparison to rainfed agriculture, firewood extraction had less detrimental effects on biocrusts.;Cyanobacteria with heterocysts | Cyanolichens | Livestock grazing | Subsistence activities | Tehuacán-Cuicatlán valley;3;0;;;UNAM;IN215916;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

This study aims to explore novel 4D-flow MRI parametric voxel-by-voxel forward flow, reverse flow, kinetic energy and stasis in BAV disease. We hypothesize that novel parametric voxel-by-voxel markers will be associated with aortic dilation and referral for surgery and can enhance our understanding of BAV hemodynamics beyond standard metrics. Methods: A total of 96 subjects (73 BAV patients, 23 healthy controls) underwent MRI scan. Healthy controls had no known cardiovascular disease. Patients were clinically referred for AAo dilation assessment. Indexed diameters were obtained by dividing the aortic diameter by the patient’s body surface area. Patients were followed for the occurrence of aortic surgery. 4D-flow analysis was performed by a single observer in five regions: left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), AAo, arch, proximal descending aorta (PDAo), and distal descending aorta (DDAo). In each region peak velocity, kinetic energy (KE), forward flow (FF), reverse flow (RF), and stasis were measured on a voxel-by-voxel basis. T-tests (or non-parametric equivalent) compared flow parameters between cohorts. Univariate and multivariate analyses explored associations between diameter and parametric voxel-by-voxel parameters. Results: Compared to controls, BAV patients showed reduced stasis (p < 0.01) and increased RF and FF (p < 0.01) throughout the aorta, and KE remained similar. In the AAo, indexed diameter correlated with age (R = 0.326, p = 0.01), FF (R = −0.648, p < 0.001), RF (R = −0.441, p < 0.001), and stasis (R = −0.288, p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, FF showed a significant inverse association with AAo indexed diameter, independent of age. During a median 179 ± 180 days of follow-up, 23 patients (32%) required aortic surgery. Compared to patients not requiring surgery, they showed increased KE and peak velocity in the proximal aorta (p < 0.01), accompanied by increased RF and reduced stasis throughout the entire aorta (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Novel voxel-by-voxel reverse flow and stasis were altered in BAV patients and are associated with aortic dilation and surgical treatment.;4D-flow imaging | bicuspid aortc valve | flow stasis | kinetic energy | parametric mapping | reverse flow;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;NIA;DGECR-2020-00204;National Institute on Aging

We identified 35 genes associated with circulating lipid levels; some of these genes have not been previously associated with lipid levels when using rare coding variation from population-based samples. We prioritize 32 genes in array-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci based on aggregations of rare coding variants; three (EVI5, SH2B3, and PLIN1) had no prior association of rare coding variants with lipid levels. Most of our associated genes showed evidence of association among multiple ancestries. Finally, we observed an enrichment of gene-based associations for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol drug target genes and for genes closest to GWAS index single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our results demonstrate that gene-based associations can be beneficial for drug target development and provide evidence that the gene closest to the array-based GWAS index SNP is often the functional gene for blood lipid levels.";association | cholesterol | exome sequencing | gene-based association | lipid;7;1;repositoryam;Green;NHLBI;R01HL127564;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

Due to the complex demographic history of Latin America and the lack of balanced representation of Native American genomes in current imputation panels, the discovery of locally relevant disease variants is likely to be missed, limiting the scope and impact of biomedical research in these populations. Therefore, the necessity of better diversity representation in genomic databases is a scientific imperative. Here, we expand the 1,000 Genomes reference panel (1KGP) with 134 Native American genomes (1KGP + NAT) to assess imputation performance in Latin American individuals of mixed ancestry. Our panel increased the number of SNPs above the GWAS quality threshold, thus improving statistical power for association studies in the region. It also increased imputation accuracy, particularly in low-frequency variants segregating in Native American ancestry tracts. The improvement is subtle but consistent across countries and proportional to the number of genomes added from local source populations. To project the potential improvement with a higher number of reference genomes, we performed simulations and found that at least 3,000 Native American genomes are needed to equal the imputation performance of variants in European ancestry tracts. This reflects the concerning imbalance of diversity in current references and highlights the contribution of our work to reducing it while complementing efforts to improve global equity in genomic research.;GWAS | Imputation | Latin Americans | Native American ancestry | reference panels | underrepresented populations;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;ICGEB;CN-19-29;University of Chicago

The role of dietary eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids in this relationship is unknown. Aim: To investigate the association of EPA and DHA with PAI-1 and resistin, as well as the role of this association on the glucose metabolism of apparently healthy subjects. Subjects and methods: Thirty-six healthy individuals were included. Validated food frequency questionnaires were used to analyse dietary habits. Inflammatory and glucose metabolism markers were quantified. Subcutaneous AT samples were obtained, and adipocyte number, area, and macrophage content were assessed. Results: In 36 subjects aged 56 ± 8 years and with a body mass index of 26 ± 4 kg/m2, logEPA, and logDHA showed significant association with logresistin and a marginal association with PAI-1. Adipocyte number, area, and lognumber of macrophages per adipocyte significantly correlated with PAI-1 but not with logresistin. Although logEPA and logDHA were independently associated with loginsulin, loginsulin resistance, and C-Peptide, the addition of logresistin, but not of PAI-1, into the multivariable model, abolished the associations. Conclusions: EPA and DHA could modulate glucose metabolism across AT functional states. Our data indicate that this association is independent of other metabolic risk factors.;adipose tissue | docosahexaenoic fatty acid | Eicosapentaenoic fatty acid | plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 | resistin;0;0;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The objective of this work was to carry out the chemical characterization of two varieties of prickly pear of Opuntia ficus-indica, one of yellow-orange coloration (Mandarina) and the other of purple coloration (Vigor), through measurements of chemical parameters and color in pulp, antioxidant activity, total phenolic compounds, and betalain content. Considering the thermolability of betalains and their potential applications in food, the thermal stability and activation energy of betacyanins from Vigor variety and betaxanthins from the Mandarina variety were also evaluated and compared with those from beetroot, the main source of betalains. Results for chemical characterization agreed with previous prickly pear reports of other regions, while the thermal degradation kinetics of betalains showed a first-order degradation pattern with respect to time and temperature treatment. Betacyanins from Vigor prickly pear showed similar thermal stability to those from beetroot, which was reflected in similar values of activation energy, while betaxanthins from Mandarina prickly pear showed a higher stability, and therefore a higher activation energy, than those from beetroot. Based on the results, the prickly pear varieties used in this study can be considered as a good source of betalains with potential applications in food and, in addition, the methodology for the evaluation of thermostability can be used to compare the stability of betalains from different sources in a temperature range of 50–90°C. Practical Application: The varieties of prickly pear used in this study can be considered a good source of red-purple and yellow-orange easily extractable pigments.

The crevices and wrinkles of the skin enhance the water-retention capacity of the epidermis. The highly vascularized ear is another region of particular interest, as its movement and vasomotor changes promote heat dissipation. Generally, these mechanisms are modulated by the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center and by the peripheral response of animals. Nonetheless, elephants are currently exposed to alterations in their habitats, such as global warming and climatic changes, which challenge their homeothermy. This article aims to discuss the thermoregulation mechanisms of African (Loxodonta africana) and Asian (Elephas maximus) elephants from an anatomical, physiological, and behavioral basis. The practical implications of these elements will be analyzed to implement tools, such as infrared thermography, or environmental enrichment, as strategies to promote the thermal balance of elephants.;elephant anatomy | Elephas maximus | Loxodonta africana | thermal state;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Novel therapeutic treatments for NP management should be based on the combination of pharmacological and nonpharmacological options. Some of them are addressed in this review with a focus on mechanisms and novel treatments. Several reports demonstrated an aberrant expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that may represent key regulatory factors with a crucial role in the pathophysiology of NP and as potential diagnostic biomarkers. This review analyses the latest evidence for cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with the role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the management of pain after SCI. Advantages in the use of circRNA are their stability (up to 48 h), and specificity as sponges of different miRNAs related to SCI and nerve injury. The present review discusses novel data about deregulated circRNAs (up or downregulated) that sponge miRNAs, and promote cellular and molecular interactions with mRNAs and proteins. This data support the concept that circRNAs could be considered as novel potential therapeutic targets for NP management especially after spinal cord injuries.;circular RNAs | molecular modulators | neuropathic pain | non-coding RNAs;0;0;;;CONICET;PICT-2020-SERIEA-00030;Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas

The current hypothesis regarding the cause of infertility is that sperm are highly sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) during spermatogenesis in the testes and transit through the epididymides, so the increase in ROS brought on by obesity could cause oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the activity of the enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) is capable of counteracting oxidative stress in sperm. The male Wistar rat was used as an overweight and obesity model, and analysis of fertility in these groups was carried out including the control group. Serum testosterone levels were determined, and the scrotal fat, testes, and epididymides were extracted. The epididymides were separated ini0 3 principal parts (caput, corpus, and cauda) before evaluating sperm viability, sperm morphology, damage to desoxyribonucleic acid of the sperm, and ROS production. The protein content and specific activity of the three enzymes mentioned above were evaluated. Results showed a gain in body weight and scrotal fat in the overweight and obese groups with decreased parameters for serum testosterone levels and sperm viability and morphology. Fertility was not greatly affected and no DNA integrity damage was found, although ROS in the epididymal sperm increased markedly and Raman spectroscopy showed a disulfide bridge collapse associated with DNA. The specific activities of CAT and GPX increased in the overweight and obesity groups, but those of SOD did not change. The amounts of proteins in the testes and epididymides decreased. These findings confirm that overweight and obesity decrease concentrations of free testosterone and seem to decrease protein content, causing poor sperm quality. Implications. An increase in scrotal fat in these conditions fosters an increase of ROS, but the increase of GPX and CAT activity seems to avoid oxidative stress increase in the sperm without damaging your DNA.;;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

However, it is considered among the most threatened ecosystems due to anthropogenic activities. Because of the problems of deforestation and biodiversity loss, it is necessary to implement conservation systems and strategies that include the propagation of native species from cuttings. Since desired characteristics can be maintained, and long growth periods be avoided, thus permitting a greater number of plants in a short period of time. The objective was to establish a method of vegetative propagation for three tree species, Bursera copallifera, Bursera fagaroides and Ipomoea murucoides with different ecological characteristics. The cuttings were obtained from trees of the tropical dry forest of the state of Morelos, Mexico. In order to evaluate the survival of the cuttings, it was related to the diameter, height and presence of leaves for each tree species in a one-year greenhouse experiment. The survival of the cuttings was compared among species with the Cox proportional hazards model. After one year, 79 %, 39 %, and 9 % of the cuttings of B. fagaroides, B. copallifera, and I. pauciflora survived, respectively. The presence of leaves had a significant effect on the survival of the cuttings, but neither the diameter nor the length of the cuttings affected their survival in the greenhouse.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of the recombinant 35S promoter (P35S CaMV) and NOS terminator (t-NOS) sequences in dough samples for tortillas produced in 2018 in urban and rural communities of the municipalities of Uruapan and Paracho in Michoacán, Mexico. The hypothesis was that tortillas from urban localities would contain a higher frequency of recombinant sequences than those produced in rural localities, as greater use of industrialized flour is assumed, where the presence of transgenes has previously been documented. Dough samples were obtained from 92 tortilla makers, and surveys were conducted to determine the origin of the grain and the possible use of industrial flour in the preparation of tortillas. The samples were grouped into an urban área with seven sub-areas and four rural areas. Sixty-three samples of DNA from the dough were analyzed for the presence of recombinant sequences using RT-PCR. Survey results indicated that the grain originated mainly (52 %) from Sinaloa (Northwestern Mexico), while the majority of producers (86.6 %) use industrialized flour. Transgenes were detected in 32 % of the samples, with t-NOS as the most frequent sequence. The highest percentage of positive samples (80 %) came from the Uruapan urban area, while only 5 % of positives were detected in rural areas.

The objective of this work was to present a floristic list of the lycophytes and ferns of the SNP and determine the species affinity between the different vegetation types. Methods: Herbarium specimens from 1900 to 2018 were examined, including collections made by the authors. The species accumulation curve was calculated by nonparametric indices; the taxonomic biodiversity index (IB, taxa/km2) was estimated using results from this study and others from areas adjacent to SNP; the Sorensen similarity index (IS) was calculated, and a cluster analysis was performed to determine the species affinity between the vegetations. The conservation status of the taxa was also documented. Key results: In total 253 species, 12 varieties and one hybrid were recorded, all circumscribed in 81 genera and 29 families; 44 taxa had not been reported previously for this area, 14 of these are new records for the state of Puebla. The montane cloud forest had the highest richness (190 species and 10 varieties). The IB for the SNP was 30.4 taxa/km2. The completeness analysis showed a trend toward the asymptote, which indicates that the number of species could still increase (22-33%). Pteridophyte similarity between vegetation types was low (IS=0-0.52), the highest value was between medium evergreen and semideciduous forests. Conclusions: The SNP contains 69.8 % of pteridophytes of the state of Puebla, therefore it is imperative to implement conservation projects and to increase collections in the less explored municipalities, especially in those with montane cloud forests";New records | Pteridophytes | Species similarity;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

However, those related to insomnia associated with mood disorders remain understudied, even though insomnia is more severe in the presence of comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to determine the direct and indirect costs of insomnia associated with depression and anxiety disorders (DAD) from the perspective of the patient in a private healthcare system. This was an observational study of chronic insomnia associated with DAD at a private Sleep Disorders Clinic in Mexico City between 2019 and 2020. Patients were followed for up to one year. Healthcare resource utilization data were collected through clinical records. Direct and indirect costs associated with insomnia treatment were estimated through micro-costing. The estimated economic burden was projected to 5 years adjusting for inflation and discounting future costs. A deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed. The median cost of the first year of insomnia treatment associated with DAD was US$3537.57 per patient. The work productivity loss represented the highest economic burden (63.84%) followed by direct medical costs (28.32%), and the direct non-medical costs (7.85%). The estimated annual economic burden for patients treated in the private healthcare system in Mexico was US$293 million. The costs of insomnia associated with DAD at a private clinic in México were found to be high. The burden of the costs faced by these patients is substantial relative to the median income of the population.

A commercial sargassum extract was evaluated as a fertilizer for tomato cultivation, it was applied at 2 (N2), 5 (N5) and 8% (N8), with and without inoculation (400 spores) of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; mineral fertilization (C+) and no fertilization (C-) were used as controls. With C+ the highest number and weight of tomatoes were obtained, but the fruits were mostly small in diameter; with organic fertilization, medium-sized fruits were obtained, and they surpassed those of C- in all the parameters evaluated. The highest content of carotenoids was found in the tomatoes from N2, N5, N8 and NM8, the highest amount of sugar in the fruits from N5, N8 and NM8, the highest maturity and flavor indices in all organically fertilized with and without arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi except NM5. The use of sargassum as a fertilizer is a good alternative to avoid the problems caused by its excessive arrival on the coasts, and it is given added value since a biofertilizer is obtained that helps production and improves the quality of tomatoes.";carotenes | mycorrhizae | quality | sargassum | tomato;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

It is, therefore, necessary to have monitoring networks that provide information that could influence decision-making both on the current and the future situation. The objective of this study was to identify priority zones where monitoring points are required for the optimization of the groundwater quality network in the Toluca Valley aquifer (Mexico), both under current (2020) and future conditions (2030). The analytical hierarchical process method was used in a Geographic Information Systems environment. The density of wells, hydraulic gradient, groundwater pollution hazard, water bodies as well as mountain zones were the analyzed criteria, as advised by expert opinion. The results are prioritization maps for every scenario. The low and moderate priority zones show the highest extension percentage in the current scenario but tend to decrease in future ones. The high-priority zones in the metropolitan area of the Toluca Valley show a 5% increase in the period and stand out for both scenarios. Finally, overlapping the current quality network with the high-priority zones for 2020 and 2030 enabled for concluding that 40.5% of wells in the existing network are essential for the current and future monitoring. The adaptation of this methodology, considering future scenarios of the conditions of the aquifer, will enable to have a monitoring network that is adaptable to these conditions over time, which in turn will facilitate the obtaining of timely data and information.;Future scenarios | Groundwater quality monitoring | Map of priority areas | Pollution hazard;0;0;;;UAEM;3318;Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México

Their natural distribution and interaction with soil fungal endophytes can increase plant fitness but have received little attention. This study aimed to identify these plant species in mine wastes, and determine colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE). The pseudo-total and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable rhizosphere concentrations of As, Cu, Cd, Pb, and Zn, bioavailability index (BI), and bioconcentration factor (BCF) were analyzed. Six ferns and one lycophyte were identified. Arsenic and metal concentrations were high, which were plant and site-dependent. All species showed hyperaccumulation of As in fronds, especially Argyrochosma formosa (2,883) and Notholaena affinis (2,160) had the highest concentrations (mg kg−1). All plants were colonized by AMF (3%−24%) and DSE (2%−33%). Astrolepis sinuata and Myriopteris notholaenoides had the maximum colonization by AMF and A. formosa by DSE. This study identifies for the first time five ferns and one lycophyte species on mine wastes, their As hyperaccumulation capacity and the simultaneous fungal colonization by AMF and DSE. These are relevant plant traits for phytoremediation. However, fungal identification and the role colonization by AMF and DSE requires full analysis.;Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi | dark septate endophytes | hyperaccumulation | phytoremediation | rhizosphere;0;0;;;;undefined;

Methodology: Equilibrium solubility tests were carried out to prepare formulations with the excipients, in which indomethacin presented a greater increase in solubility; the systems were characterized by self-emulsification time, physical stability, particle size, zeta potential, dissolution profiles and permeation through synthetic membrane. Results: The experimental design of self-emulsifying delivery systems allowed to create formulations that increase the solubility of indomethacin in an order of 105 times with respect to the aqueous solubility. The feasible formulations presented autoemulsification times less than 60 seconds, in addition, the particle size distributions of the dispersions were less than 300 nm, with polydispersity index smaller than 0.3, and zeta potential values lower than -25 mV. The dissolution profiles showed that the formulations comply with a similarity factor value greater than 50, in addition, the permeability through a synthetic membrane is higher for the selfemulsifying formulations than the reference product. Conclusion: The formulation of indomethacin into self-emulsifying delivery systems enhances the solubility in aqueous medium, increases dissolution and accelerate release.

The purpose of this study was to know the environmental factors mainly related to the migration patterns of lutjanids in La Mancha lagoon inlet. During 19 months, 24-hour cycles were performed monthly, taking samples every two hours (442 samples). Environmental variables recorded in situ and with regional records such as rainfall, atmospheric temperature and day length were considered. Genetic barcoding (COI) was used to validate species identity. Significant differences were evaluated by PERMANOVA and a Canonical Correspondence Analysis was used to determine the importance of environmental variables. Six species were recorded and the most abundant showed significant differences among months, with migration patterns during the warm-rainy season. Day length, salinity and rainfall (two of them with regional incidence) were the variables significantly associated with the distribution of the species. The abundance of Lutjanus analis, L. jocu, and L. cyanopterus was inversely associated with the length of daylight and directly related to rainfall, while L. synagris and L. griseus showed segregation along a salinity gradient. Thus, migration patterns were mainly correlated with factors of regional coverage and greater seasonal influence.;Atmospheric Temperature | Competition | Photoperiod | Water Level | Zooplankton;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;CVU–637206;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

However, the yield of these crops is not fully achieved due to biotic factors such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Viruses are capable of causing alterations in plant growth and development, thereby impacting the yield of their hosts significantly. In this work, we first compiled the world′s most comprehensive list of known edible fruits that fits our definition. Then, plant viruses infecting those trees and herbs that produce fruits with commercial importance in the global market were identified. The identified plant viruses belong to 30 families, most of them containing single-stranded RNA genomes. Importantly, we show the overall picture of the host range for some virus families following an evolutionary approach. Further, the current knowledge about plant-virus interactions, focusing on the main disorders they cause, as well as yield losses, is summarized. Additionally, since accurate diagnosis methods are of pivotal importance for viral diseases control, the current and emerging technologies for the detection of these plant pathogens are described. Finally, the most promising strategies employed to control viral diseases in the field are presented, focusing on solutions that are long-lasting.;Crop | Diagnosis | Disease | Eudicots | Fruit | Magnoliids | Monocots | Pathogen | Plants | Virus | Yield;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Despite there are many attempts to control this insect, most of them depend on conventional pesticides. Thus, the current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of whole-cell suspension, cell-free supernatant and crude cells of the symbiotic bacteria Photorhabdus sp. and Xenorhabdu sp., as bio-control agents for housefly stages. Materials and Methods: The Photorhabdus sp. and Xenorhabdu sp., were isolated from the entomopathogenic nematodes, Heterorhabditis indica and Steinernema feltiae, respectively. The phenotypic, as well as the enzymatic characterizations of both bacteria, were determined. In addition, histopathological changes of the alimentary canal of M. domestica adults treated with whole-cell suspensions (at 3×108 cells mLG1) of both bacteria were carefully examined using transmission electron microscopy. Results: The results showed that both symbiotic bacteria significantly suppressed larvae, pupae and adults of M. domestica, particularly when they were applied as whole-cell suspensions. For example, the highest concentration of whole-cell suspension, cell-free supernatant and crude cells of Photorhabdus sp., induced larval mortalities by 94.7, 64.0 and 45.3%, while those of Xenorhabdus sp., induced larval mortalities by 58.7, 46.7 and 30.7% at 96 hrs, respectively. The results also showed that whole-cell suspensions of both symbiotic bacteria caused severe histopathological changes in the ultrastructure of the treated adults’ alimentary canal. Conclusion: Both symbiotic bacteria can be effectively used, particularly the whole-cell suspension, as bio-control agents against the housefly either in the larval or adult stage.;bio-control agents | cell-free supernatant | crude cells | histopathology | Housefly | Photorhabdus sp | whole-cell suspension | Xenorhabdus sp;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Insect proteins have gained relevance because of their high potential as gelling, texturing, and extender agents in the food industry. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of substituting meat with a soluble protein extract from grasshopper obtained by alkalisation or alkalisation-piezoelectric ultrasound, on the techno-functional, physicochemical, and sensory characteristics of cooked meat models (sausages). The soluble protein was extracted in NaHCO3 pH 8 and a piezoelectric ultrasound 5-mm sonotrode at 20 kHz with 99% amplitude. Different formulations with meat substitution: 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% were prepared and characterised for their rheological behaviour, emulsion stability, weight loss by cooking, total protein content, colour, and texture. Sensory evaluation was conducted with consumers using a test involving check-all-that-apply and overall liking. The alkalisation-piezoelectric ultrasound method improved the solubility and the techno-functional properties of the soluble grasshopper protein when applied in sausages at maximum levels of 10% meat substitution. The sensory evaluation indicated that the formulation with 5% meat substitution exhibited the same acceptability as the control sample. Given these results, the soluble protein treated with alkalisation and piezoelectric ultrasound could be used as an extender in meat products.;edible insect | functional properties | sausages | sensory | soluble protein;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Methods: Patients (n = 17) diagnosed with sleep apnea or primary snoring were included in this study and subsequently treated with MADs. Changes were assessed using a polysomnographic study (PSG), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and an imaging study with computed tomography scanning (CT). Studies were performed before and after the use of MAD. Anteroposterior measurements were taken in the sagittal plane at the hard palate, glottis, and supraglottic levels along the hard palate axis. Afterward, measurements were taken in the axial plane at the same levels along the hard palate axis. Results: From the six recorded measurements, the airway caliber increased by five. However, these changes were significant only in two measurements (sagittal hard palate and axial supraglottic). Snoring was controlled in 16 of the 17 subjects. From these sixteen, 12 subjects had a correct opening of the airway at the hard palate level. Moreover, daytime sleepiness decreased in all subjects.

Edaphic characteristics are used to determine the viability of places considered as suitable to obtain castor oil. The objectives of this study were to determine the edaphic characteristics and oil content of R. communis, and to evaluate elicitation with salicylic acid (SA) in El Marqués, Querétaro, Mexico. Sampling was carried out in a direct way, selecting sites where castor bean plants were found. Samples of 1.5 kg of soil were taken and 3 clusters of castor bean in a mature state were collected from 21 accessions. The physicochemical characteristics of the soil and oil content of seeds were determined. Finally, 300 plants of the Guanajuatoil variety were planted and elicitated with different SA concentrations under greenhouse conditions in order to determine oil content. The physical analysis of the soil samples indicated dark-colored soils, Mollisol and Vertisol types, with different textures: clay, clay loam, sandy clay loam and sandy loam. Soil chemical analyses showed the following soil characteristics: pH 7.22; electrical conductivity 0.52 dS m-1; organic matter 7.17%; cation exchange capacity 26.77; calcium 38.62, magnesium 6.81, sodium 13.41and potassium 6.97 cmol kg-1; and nitrogen and phosphorus contents of 16.32 and 54 mg kg-1, respectively. Castor oil content was higher in clay soils (41.46%). The plants elicited with SA presented oil contents ranging from 28.99% to 52.9%, obtained with 100 and 900 µM. In conclusion, elicitation with SA is an adequate method to increase oil content in castor bean seeds. The locality of El Marqués has good potential for the production of castor oil.";castor oil | elicitation | Mollisol | Vertisol;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Methods: Solubility measurements of PZQ were performed in lipid excipients and hydrophilic substances; ternary phase diagrams were constructed with the excipients in which PZQ showed increased solubility. SEDDS formulations were characterized by globule size, the polydispersity index, zeta potential, the self-emulsification time, and morphology by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The formulations were evaluated by performing in vitro dissolution profiles and permeation profiles in an ex vivo model. Results: Four SEDDS formulations were identified that increased the apparent solubility of praziquantel by 60–150 times. The dispersion sizes obtained were < 350 nm, with polydispersity index values < 0.3, dispersion times < 60 s, and zeta potential values < −25 mV. A notable increase in the PZQ dissolution rate was obtained compared with the reference drug product. The permeation profiles were adjusted to a first-order kinetic model, obtaining an apparent absorption rate constant (Kab) up to 18 times higher for SEDDS formulations than for PZQ powder, while the apparent permeability (Papp) and the effective intestinal permeability (Peff) values increased up to 18 times for SEDDS formulations compared with PZQ powder. Conclusion: The incorporation of PZQ into a SEDDS increases its apparent solubility and dissolution rate, changes that significantly enhance the processes of intestinal permeability. This behavior can be applied to support formulations of drugs belonging to class IV of the biopharmaceutical classification system.";Low-solubility | Permeability | Praziquantel | Self-emulsification;0;0;;;;723227;

The inhibition of Aβ aggregation has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for AD. Pristine C60 has shown the capacity to interact with the Aβ peptide and interfere with fibril formation but induces significant toxic effects in vitro and in vivo. Objective: To evaluate the potential of a series of C60 multiadducts to inhibit the Aβ fibrillization. Methods: A series of C60 multiadducts with four to six diethyl malonyl and their corresponding disodium-malonyl substituents were synthesized as individual isomers. Their potential on Aβ fibrillization inhibition was evaluated in vitro, in cellulo, and silico. Antioxidant activity, acetylcholinesterase inhibition capacity, and toxicity were assessed in vitro. Results: The multiadducts modulate Aβ fibrils formation without inducing cell toxicity, and that the number and polarity of the substituents play a significant role in the adducts efficacy to modulate Aβ aggregation. The molecular mechanism of fullerene-Aβ interaction and modulation was identified. Furthermore, the fullerene derivatives exhibited antioxidant capacity and reduction of acetylcholinesterase activity. Conclusion: Multiadducts of C60 are novel multi-target-directed ligand molecules that could hold considerable promise as the starting point for the development of AD therapies.;Alzheimer's disease | fullerenes | molecular dynamics | nanoparticles | polymerization | therapy;1;0;;;CONACYT;319328;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Whey is a rich source of proteins and components related to biological activity. It is known that proteins have effects that promote health benefits. Peptides derived from whey proteins are currently widely studied. These bioactive peptides are amino acid sequences that are encrypted within the first structure of proteins, which required hydrolysis for their release. The hydrolysis could be through in vitro or in vivo enzymatic digestion and using microorganisms in fermented systems. The biological activities associated with bio-peptides include immunomodulatory properties, antibacterial, antihypertensive, antioxidant and opioid, etc. These functions are related to general conditions of health or reduced risk of certain chronic illnesses. To determine the suitability of these peptides/ingredients for applications in food technology, clinical studies are required to evaluate their bioavailability, health claims, and safety of them. This review aimed to describe the biological importance of whey proteins according to the incidence in human health, their role as bioactive peptides source, describing methods, and obtaining technics. In addition, the paper exposes biochemical mechanisms during the activity exerted by biopeptides of whey, and their application trends.;antihypertensive peptide | Bioactive peptide | human health | milk | whey proteins;1;0;;;;undefined;

Objective: To describe histological and cytological characteristics of Porites panamensis larvae. Methods: During August-July 2019, at Islas Marias Biosphere Reserve, Central Mexican Pacific, we made 14 collections of coral larvae and identified the species with cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene. We used a scan-ning electron microscope and other techniques. Results: The ectoderm was composed by heterogeneous, mono-ciliated, columnar epithelial cells. Nematocysts were clustered at the oral pole of the ectoderm, and cells were evident in the aboral pole of the ectoderm gland. The endoderm had secretory cells, lipids and symbionts. Conclusions: The abundance of secretory cells and nematocysts in the aboral pole suggests their importance in substrate exploration and larval settlement.

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruit is highly consumed worldwide and contains high amounts of carotenoids and tocopherols, two powerful antioxidants. Native tomato genotypes are rarely used in large-scale market but serve as a reservoir to diversify the species gene pool and can be employed to obtain functional compounds. Extraction methods are currently changing towards cleaner procedures that are more efficient and environmentally friendly, including avoiding toxic or polluting solvents. Experimental approach. In this study, factorial and fractional factorial designs were used to evaluate the efficiency of digestive enzymes, sonication and green solvents to obtain lipophilic antioxidant extracts from native tomato. To monitor the efficiency of the extraction process, spectrophotometric quantification of total carotenoids and antioxidant activity was carried out, and then individual quantification of carotenoids and tocopherols in the extracts was done by HPLC. Results and conclusions. Digestive enzymes and sonication increased the carotenoid content and the antioxidant activity of the obtained extracts when applied individually. However, when these treatments were applied together and in combination with isopropyl acetate, a green solvent, the obtained extracts had the highest carotenoid and tocopherol contents as well as the maximal antioxidant activity. A correlation analysis suggested that antioxidant activity resulted from synergistic effects rather than individual compounds. Tomato extracts were obtained through a rapid and environmentally friendly extraction method and their antioxidant activity was enhanced. Novelty and scientific contribution. Tomato fruits have been the subject of numerous studies; however, functional compound extraction through environmentally friendly methods remains an attractive use of native tomato fruit, enhancing its limited production and harnessing a large amount of tomato product industry. There are few reports where environmentally friendly extraction methods are combined; even rarer are those where green solvents are also used. In this work, the combination of different environmentally friendly extraction methods improved the extraction of carotenoids and tocopherols and allowed to establish a more efficient process. These results could stimulate the use of clean technologies and make the native tomato more attractive for industrial or compound extraction processes.";enzyme-assisted extraction | green solvents | lipophilic antioxidants | native tomato genotype | sonication;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;427240;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In Mexico, at least eight Leptospira serogroups are known to affect sheep, but little is known about their distribution. The aim was to analyse the spatial distribution of seroreactive sheep to eight serogroups of Leptospira spp. through ecological niche modelling from the state of Veracruz. We carried out a cross-sectional, multistage, and stratified epidemiological study, sampling 405 sheep in different regions of the state (north, center, and south). The sera were analysed using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) to identify seropositivity to eight Leptospira serogroups (Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pyrogenes, Grippotyphosa, Canicola, Pomona, Hardjo, Wolffi, and Tarassovi). Management variables in the sampled herds were evaluated through a survey among the producers, which was analysed using the chi-squared test for cross-tabulation. Geospatial modelling was conducted using MAXENT and 19 climatic variables, and validation was carried out using the area under the curve (AUC). No positive animals were found for Pomona in any area of Veracruz, and there was only one case of seroreactivity to Grippotyphosa. The total seroprevalence found was 53.83% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.84–58.75). The main serogroup found was Sejroe (55.31%, 95% CI 50.32-60.20%), followed by Canicola (8.64%, 95% CI 6.17-11.92%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (4.69%, 95% CI 2.93-7.36%), Tarassovi (3.95%, 95% CI 2.35-6.47%), Pyrogenes (2.47%, 95% CI 1.26-4.64%), Australis (0.99%, 95% CI 0.32-2.69%), and Grippotyphosa (0.25%, 95% CI 0.01-1.59%). The predictive model for Australis was not significant. Acceptable predictive models (AUC > 0.7-0.8) were found for Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pyrogenes, and Tarassovi, while for Sejroe, it was excellent (AUC > 0.85); consequently, the climatic variables that most contributed to the model were those related to precipitation.

Recently, murine lungs have been shown to be a significant source of hematopoietic progenitors in a process known as extramedullary hematopoiesis. Using multiparametric flow cytometry, we have identified mesenchymal, endothelial, and hematopoietic progenitor cells that express the secreted small protein Isthmin 1 (ISM1). Further characterization of hematopoietic progenitor cells indicated that ISM1+ Lineage- Sca-1+ c-kit+ (ISM1+ LSK) cells are enriched in short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs). Moreover, most Sca-1+ ISM1+ cells express the residence marker CD49a, and this correlated with their localization in the extravascular region of the lung, indicating that ISM1+ cells are lung-resident cells. We also observed that ISM1+ cells express TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9, and, in a mouse model of sepsis induced by P. aeruginosa, we observed that all the LSK and ISM1+LSK cells were affected. We conclude that ISM1 is a novel biomarker associated with progenitor-like cells. ISM1+ cells are involved in the response to a bacterial challenge, suggesting an association between ISM1-producing cells and dangerous inflammatory responses like sepsis.;;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Therefore, the objective of the present work was the isolation of the fungal microbiota present in the sugarcane straw (CP 72-2082) and its capacity to produce hydrolytic enzymes. The fungal microbiota was isolated by sampling for four months one sampling for month the straw in fields of the “El Potrero” sugar mill in the Veracruz state, Mexico, and soil was also sampled to determine the effect of straw chili on the organic matter content. Furthermore, the capacity of the strains to produce xylanases and cellulases was determined in a Petri dish using birch xylan and carboxymethylcellulose as substrates. Thirty-four strains were isolated from the samples, in all was identified the genera Trichoderma, Fusarium in three and Aspergillus and Penicillum in two. The results indicate that if sugarcane straw is reincorporated into soils where sugarcane is grown, it can have a beneficial impact, 22 isolated strains showed the ability to produce hydrolytic enzymes. The organic matter content in the soils with both shredded and unshredded crop residues showed that chili does not present a benefit to the soil but can contribute beneficial fungal microbiota for various purposes.;Cellulases | Fungus | Saccharum officinarum | Trichoderma | Xylanases;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Every day around the world, there are more than 150 million subway passengers. Since 2013, thousands of microbiome samples from various subways worldwide have been sequenced. Skin bacteria and environmental organisms dominate the subway microbiomes. The literature has revealed common bacterial groups in subway systems; even so, it is possible to identify cities by their microbiome. Low frequency bacteria are responsible for specific bacterial fingerprints of each subway system. Furthermore, daily subway commuters leave their microbial clouds and interact with other passengers. Microbial exchange is quite fast; the hand microbiome changes within minutes, and after cleaning the handrails, the bacteria are re-established within minutes. To investigate new taxa and metabolic pathways of subway microbial communities, several high-quality metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAG) have been described. Subways are harsh environments unfavorable for microorganism growth. However, recent studies have observed a wide diversity of viable and metabolically active bacteria. Understanding which bacteria are living, dormant, or dead allows us to propose realistic ecological interactions. Questions regarding the relationship between humans and the subway microbiome, particularly the microbiome effects on personal and public health, remain unanswered. This review summarizes our knowledge of subway microbiomes and their relationship with passenger microbiomes.";built environment | metaSUB | metro | microbiome | subway | urban;2;0;;;;undefined;

Methodology: The regional innovation system was analyzed by identifying the innovation networks. Subsequently, a typology of enterprises was generated according to the networks in which they participate and an analysis of variance and comparison tests of Scheffé means between clusters. Findings: In the regional innovation system, the networks were made up of government institutions, teaching and research institutions, and suppliers of inputs and services, where the latter have the highest degrees of articulation. Also, positive effects were identified in the efficiency indicators of the enterprises related to the networks made up of government institutions, teaching and research institutions, and the extension services. Practical implications: The identification of these interactions is essential for the design of public policies for the promotion of innovation. For example, for the design of a smart extension program that articulates all the actors and that all benefit from their interactions. Theoretical implications: The study reveals the positive influence of the regional innovation system on enterprises. In addition, it rekindles the discussion on the relevance of the State in the operation of innovation systems, the role of universities in the generation of knowledge and the extension service in the diffusion of new knowledge, information and practices.

Pericytes are heterogeneous cells located around brain microvessels; they present three different morphologies along the CNS vascular tree: ensheathing, mesh, and thin-strand pericytes. At the arteriole–capillary transition ensheathing pericytes are found, while mesh and thin-strand pericytes are located at capillary beds. Brain pericytes are essential for the establishment and maintenance of the blood–brain barrier, which restricts the passage of soluble and potentially toxic molecules from the circulatory system to the brain parenchyma. Pericytes play a key role in regulating local inflammation at the CNS. Pericytes can respond differentially, depending on the degree of inflammation, by secreting a set of neurotrophic factors to promote cell survival and regeneration, or by potentiating inflammation through the release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines and chemokines), and the overexpression of cell adhesion molecules. Under inflammatory conditions, pericytes may regulate immune cell trafficking to the CNS and play a role in perpetuating local inflammation. In this review, we describe pericyte responses during acute and chronic neuroinflammation.

Recent findings of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxicity in populations of P. bahamense var. bahamense weakened the interest in accepting both varieties as independent, and even investigating the possibility of crypticism between them. In the few studies that have involved molecular evidence in the treatment of varieties, their taxonomic independence continues to be denied, despite the evident and consistent genetic separation shown in all analyses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to recognize, based on genetic evidence, the taxonomic independence of the two varieties of Pyrodinium: P. bahamense var. compressum and var. bahamense. Methods: Based on three molecular markers (Lcf, LSU, SSU) of sequences available in GenBank, statistical parsimony networks and a concatenated phylogenetic analysis were constructed. Key results: In all analyses, a genetic structure was consistently obtained for P. bahamense var. bahamense and another one for P. bahamense var. compressum. Furthermore, the correspondence of the resulting haplotypes and ribotypes was always the same in both networks and phylogeny, i.e., the samples from the Pacific Ocean were always placed in a different group than those from the Atlantic Ocean. Conclusions: The evidence provided in this study demonstrated the reproductive isolation between both varieties, and even the possible presence of a not yet described third variety, as a consequence of which we propose the validity and taxonomic independence of P. bahamense var. compressum and P. bahamense var. bahamense.;genetic variation | Lcf | Lcf | LSU | LSU | red de parsimonia estadística | SSU | SSU | statistical parsimony network | variación genética;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

It is also a drug traditionally used in dermatological therapies due to its anti-inflammatory effect. In recent years its antioxidant, antiexcitotoxic, and antiapoptotic effects have been described in different ischemic damage models, traumatic damage, and models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Finally, dapsone has proven to be a safe and effective drug as a protector against heart, renal and pulmonary cells damage; that is why it is now employed in clinical trials with patients as a neuroprotective therapy by regulating the main mechanisms of damage that lead to cell death. Objective: The objective of this study is to provide a descriptive review of the evidence demonstrating the safety and therapeutic benefit of dapsone treatment, evaluated in animal studies and various human clinical trials Methods: We conducted a review of PubMed databases looking for scientific research in animals and humans, oriented to demonstrate the effect of dapsone on regulating and reducing the main mechanisms of damage that lead to cell death.

In this work, the underlying mechanisms, reasons and consequences of overflow metabolism in different organisms have been summarized. The reported effect of aerobic expression of Vitreoscilla haemoglobin (VHb) in different organisms are revised. The use of VHb to reduce overflow metabolism is proposed and studied through flux balance analysis in E. coli at a fixed maximum substrate and oxygen uptake rates. Simulations showed that the presence of VHb increases the growth rate, while decreasing acetate production, in line with the experimental measurements. Therefore, aerobic VHb expression is considered a potential tool to reduce overflow metabolism in cells.;Flux balance analysis | Overflow metabolism | P/O ratio | Vitreoscilla haemoglobin;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Humans have eight genes for these myosins. Class I Myosins have different functions: regulate membrane tension, participate in endocytosis, exocytosis, intracellular trafficking and cell migration. Cell migration is influenced by many cellular components including motor proteins, like myosins. Recently has been reported that changes in myosin expression have an impact on the migration of cancer cells, the formation of infiltrates and metastasis. We propose that class I myosins might be potential markers for future diagnostic, prognostic or even as therapeutic targets in leukemia and other cancers.

The aim is to better understand the functionality of these receptors and their role in maintaining the temperature of animals, or those susceptible to thermal stress. The majority of peripheral receptors are TRP cation channels formed from transmembrane proteins that function as transductors through changes in the membrane potential. TRP are classified into seven families and two groups. The data gathered for this review include controversial aspects because we do not fully know the mechanisms that operate the opening and closing of the TRP gates. Deductions, however, suggest the intervention of mechanisms related to G protein-coupled receptors, dephosphorylation, and ligands. Several questions emerge from the review as well. For example, the future uses of these data for controlling thermoregulatory disorders and the invitation to researchers to conduct more extensive studies to broaden our understanding of these mechanisms and achieve substantial advances in controlling fever, hyperthermia, and hypothermia.;Ion channels | Mammals | Thermoregulation | TRP;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The Programme for Ecosystem Change and Society (PECS) has been coordinating Place-Based Social-Ecological Sustainability Research (PBSESR) across the globe and emphasizes the need for regional scientific nodes from diverse biocultural regions to inform sustainability science and action. In this paper, we assess the strengths of the PBSESR communities in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We provide an overview of PBSESR literature associated with this region and highlight the achievements of two prominent regional networks: The Social-Ecological Systems and Sustainability Research Network from Mexico (SocioEcoS) and the South American Institute for Resilience and Sustainability Studies from Uruguay (SARAS Institute). Finally, we identify the potential in these nodes to constitute a regional PECS node in Latin America and discuss the capacity needed to ensure such function. The results of the literature review show that while still loosely interconnected across the region, networks play key roles in connecting otherwise cloistered teams and we illustrate how the SocioEcoS network (focusing on transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge towards sustainability) and the SARAS Institute (focusing on innovative approaches for looking at complex social-ecological problems, rooted in slow science and arts) operate as key connectors in the region. We conclude that these organizations combined can embody a Latin American node for PECS, and would thereby not only contribute to regional but also global capacities to advance the sustainability agenda.;Interdisciplinary research networks | network analysis | place-based research | Reinette Biggs | social-ecological systems | sustainability | transdisciplinary collaboration;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;SEP;511-6/18-9453;Secretaría de Educación Pública

It is an endemic disease in swine production in the central region of Mexico and causes nervous signs and high mortality in suckling pigs, pneumonia in growing pigs, orchitis in boars and mummification during gestation. PRV hemagglutinates most red blood cells (RBCs) of domestic species. For serological diagnosis, the hemagglutination inhibition test is used, and in this test, guinea pig, bovine and chicken RBCs have been commonly used. In this investigation, hemagglutination with PRV was evaluated using the RBCs of seven domestic species (chicken, bovine, horse, pig, dog, guinea pig and rabbit). In the hemagglutination test, the following parameters were evaluated: temperature (25 °C and 37 °C), bottoms of the wells (V and U), erythrocyte concentration (0.5%, 0.75%, and 1%), and reading time (15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min). Significant differences (P < 0.001) were found in most of the evaluated treatments. The best hemagglutination results were obtained with chicken, bovine and horse RBCs. The hemagglutination titer is higher (2 dilutions) when using chicken RBCs than when using bovine or horse RBCs. If chicken RBCs are used in the inhibition of hemagglutination, the test will be more sensitive, while it is more specific when bovine or horse RBCs are used. The hemagglutination readings are imprecise when using RBCs from dogs, pigs, guinea pigs and rabbits. RBCs from these species should not be used for the diagnosis or investigation of PRV.;Blue eye disease | Diagnosis | Hemagglutinating activity | Porcine orthorubulavirus;0;0;;;;IT-201918;

The in vitro anti-inflammatory activities of MA were assessed on LPS-stimulated macrophages, membrane stabilization assay, and inhibition of protein denaturation, whereas the inhibitory activity of MA on in vivo inflammation was assessed on TPA-induced ear edema using acute and chronic assays in mice. The inhibitory effect of MA on nociception was assessed using three in vivo models. MA exerted in vitro anti-inflammatory activity by the increase (58%) in the production of IL-10 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. In the in vivo assay, MA showed good anti-inflammatory effects on the acute (ED50 = 62 mg/kg) and chronic (ED50 = 77 mg/kg) TPA-induced ear edema. The antinociceptive activity of MA was related to the participation of the nitrergic system in the formalin-induced paw licking test. Practical applications: Previous studies with different plant extracts containing MA, as one of their major components, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive actions. However, the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive actions of myristic acid have not been previously reported. The results suggest that MA induced anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated macrophages through the participation of IL-10. The antinociceptive effects of MA are attributed to the participation of the nitrergic system.;;4;0;;;;undefined;

In spite of the fact that relevant structural differences between mouse and human islet architectures have been described, the functional implications of these differences remain only partially understood. In this work, aiming to contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between structural and functional properties of pancreatic islets, we reconstructed human and mice islets in order to perform a structural comparison based on both morphologic and network-derived metrics. According to our results, human islets constitute a more efficient network from a connectivity viewpoint, mainly due to the higher proportion of heterotypic contacts between islet cells in comparison to mice islets.;architecture | cell-to-cell contact | network | Pancreatic islets | reconstruction;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In this work, the regioselective synthesis of fatty acid esters of short-chain inulin-type fructooligosaccharides (FOS) was carried out in a two-step process comprising sequential enzymatic reactions of transfructosylation and acylation. In the first step, Schedonorus arundinaceus sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST, EC 2.4.1.99) converted sucrose (600 g/L) into the trisaccharide 1-kestose and the tetrasaccharide nystose in a ratio 9:1 with their sum accounting for 53% (w/w) of total carbohydrates. In the second step, the FOS mixture was transesterified with vinyl laurate in 2-methyl-2-butanol by immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) (EC.3.1.1.3). NMR analysis of the synthesized monolaurate FOS esters revealed a regioselective acylation of the 6-OH of the terminal fructosyl moiety of both 1-kestose and nystose. The hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values of 6’’-O-lauroyl-1-kestose and 6’’’-O-lauroylnystose were 14.7 and 15.7, respectively; which suggests their use as oil in water (O/W) emulsifiers. The main compound 6’’-O-lauroyl-1-kestose with critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 0.6 mM and surface tension of 45.8 mN/m proved to be a more efficient surfactant than 6’’’-O-lauroylnystose (CMC 5.38 mM) and surface tension 36.26 mN/m).

Competitive environments provide the conditions for adjusting reproductive decisions in order to compensate for the negative impacts of competition between individuals, thus maintaining reproductive fitness. This research aimed to test the effect of perceived competition risks for mate choice and their consequences in the reproductive effort of females of the annual killifish Millerichthys robustus induced throughout an audience effect. First, I evaluated the female mate choice using a classic dichotomous preference study based on male size, showing that the females do not show a significant preference for males of any size in a scenario without perceived competition; however, females turn selective under competition risk, choosing the large males. I then evaluated the reproductive effort of females through embryo production without an audience for 10 days, and next with an audience of females for two periods of 10 days. Results showed that females produced significantly more embryos when they perceived a risk of competition. Also, females turn selective under risk of competition, probably due to an increased parental investment expressed by the reduction of the female-male encounters and breeding rate, the increased reproductive effort and the time spent searching a mate. Females that mate with larger males may gain access to more benefits derived from his social status, as best territories and high-quality sites for the spawn, thus increasing the probabilities of survival for the females and their offspring. I propose that, as a life-history strategy to preserve individual fitness, the direction of the sexual selection is modified by the perceived competition risk, and that competition is not necessarily related with the high-cost investments; in fact, it may also have, beneficial effects for the individual female reproductive success.";audience effect | life-history strategies | reproductive cost | reproductive plasticity | sexual selection;1;0;;;;undefined;

The biota supported by such water bodies present a range of capacities to remain in this environment for all or part of their life cycles. During floods, temporary pools can connect with permanent streams, promoting changes in trophic networks in the aquatic food webs. The aim of this research was to analyse the feeding ecology of a fish community in a temporary pool near of Tlacotalpan, in the Mexican southeast, in order to understand the dynamics of the feeding habits. First, we identified feeding habits that can be interpreted as guilds of the fishes in the temporary pool: the annual killifish Millerichthys robustus (the only autochthonous species) is planktophagous; Cynodonichthys tenuis and Astyanax aeneus are insectivores; Dormitator maculatus and larvae of amphibians (Lithobates sp.) are mainly detritivorous; and Poecilia mexicana is planktophagous and insectivorous. We then estimated the effect of coexistence on niche breadth and overlap. The niches of M. robustus and P. mexicana evidenced overlap, but the breadth was adjusted inversely, suggesting feeding specialisation in M. robustus in response to competition. We documented the existence of two cohorts of M. robustus; the niche breadth of the first and second cohorts suggesting different strategies probably related to competition under variable conditions. The niche of C. tenuis and A. aeneus, and D. maculatus and tadpoles overlapped, following a pattern of feeding generalisation in response to competition.";annual killifish | feeding competition | gut content | niche breadth | niche overlap;3;0;;;;undefined;

However, increasing evidence shows that males can also be choosy. Mate choice can be based on physical characteristics, such as body size and color ornaments, which have been documented as factors that also influence the maintenance of polymorphism. Here, we experimentally tested whether males of the annual killifish Millerichthys robustus preferentially choose females according to variations in ocelli number on the base of the caudal fin, or according to body size, in classical dual decision experiments. We demonstrated that there is a strong preference of the males of M. robustus for females with greater numbers of ocelli on the base of the caudal fin (females with 5–7 versus 1–2 ocelli) and for females of larger body size. We also tested whether female body size or number of ocelli are linked to higher fecundity or increased egg size, quantifying the number of embryos produced by the females of each experimental group and measuring the size of their eggs. Our results revealed that large females with more ocelli produced more and larger eggs than large females with fewer ocelli, and than small females regardless of the number of ocelli. These results may suggest that males of M. robustus that choose large-sized females can mate with genetic quality in parameters directly related to biological success, such as higher egg production of large-sized eggs. This is probably related to a higher hatching percentage, and larger subsequent larvae with rapid growth rates. We therefore propose that large body size and high number of ocelli on the base of the caudal fin in females could have evolved through male mate choice.;body size | color-polymorphism | eyespots | male mate choice | sexual selection;2;0;;;;undefined;

Due to their positive impact on human health, the incorporation of HMO into the infant formula or other functional foods has become highly desirable. Currently, their large-scale production is limited to 2’-fucosyllactose (2’FL) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) that are obtained through fermentation and added to the infant formula as fortifiers. Fewer advances have been made for other HMO to reach the industrial scale synthesis.

(Apocynaceae) is a perennial shrub used in the folk treatment of parasitism, pain, and inflammation. Aim of the study: This work assessed the antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and sedative effects of an ethanol extract from the aerial parts of Asclepias curassavica (ACE). Materials and methods: The antiparasitic activity against Trichomonas vaginalis was evaluated using the trypan blue exclusion test. The in vitro anti-inflammatory actions of ACE (1–200 μg/ml) were analyzed using LPS-stimulated primary murine macrophages. The in vivo pharmacological activity of ACE (50–200 mg/kg p.o.) was evaluated using animal models of inflammation (TPA-induced ear edema test and carrageenan-induced paw edema test) and nociception (acetic acid-induced writhing test, formalin-induced licking test, and hot plate test). Results: ACE showed poor antiparasitic effects against Trichomonas vaginalis (IC50 = 302 μg/ml). ACE increased the production of IL-10 in both in vitro assays (EC50 = 3.2 pg/ml) and in vivo assays (ED50 = 111 mg/kg). ACE showed good antinociceptive actions (ED50 = 158 mg/kg in phase 1 and ED50 = 83 mg/kg in phase 2) in the formalin test. Pre-treatment with naloxone blocked the antinociceptive response induced by ACE. In addition, ACE did not induce sedative effects or motor coordination deficits in mice. Conclusion: Findings showed that the anti-inflammatory activity of ACE is associated with increasing levels of IL-10 in both in vitro and in vivo assays, whereas the antinociceptive effect is associated with the participation of the opioidergic system, without inducing sedation or motor coordination impairment.;Anti-inflammatory | Antinociceptive | Asclepias curassavica | IL-10;2;0;;;UG;CIIC 130/2021;Universidad de Guanajuato

The MMOBI method presented a higher C content in soil and litter (127.89 Mg C ha-1), but the largest carbon reservoir was found in the tree biomass of the pine-oak forest (383.9 Mg C ha-1 ). The MMOBI can be a management alternative that favors carbon stocks in the soil, while the pine-oak forest demonstrates a potential as a tree carbon stocks at an age over 40 years old.;MDS | MMOBI | Oak forests | Pine forests | Pine-oak forests;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

A strategy based on the modification of culture media and aeration conditions was carried out to increase the cell concentration of A. vinelandii, in order to favor and determine its tolerance to chlorpyrifos and its degradation ability. The culture in shaken flasks, using sucrose as a carbon source, significantly improved the growth compared to media with mannitol. When the strain was cultivated under oxygen-limited (5.5, 11.25 mmol L−1 h−1) and no-oxygen-limited conditions (22 mmol L−1 h−1), the growth parameters were not affected. In cultures in a liquid medium with chlorpyrifos, the bacteria tolerated a high pesticide concentration (500 ppm) and the growth parameters were improved even under conditions with a reduced carbon source (sucrose 2 g L−1). The strain degraded 99.6% of chlorpyrifos at 60 h of cultivation, in co-metabolism with sucrose; notably, A. vinelandii ATCC 12837 reduced by 50% the initial pesticide concentration in only 6 h (DT50).

Although senescent astrocytes have been found in old-age brains and neurodegenerative diseases, their impact on the function of other cerebral cell types is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of senescent astrocytes on the mitochondrial function of a neuron. In order to evaluate neuronal susceptibility to a long and constant senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) exposure, we developed a model by using cellular cocultures in transwell plates. Rat primary cortical astrocytes were seeded in transwell inserts and induced to premature senescence with hydrogen peroxide [stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS)]. Independently, primary rat cortical neurons were seeded at the bottom of transwells. After neuronal 6 days in vitro (DIV), the inserts with SIPS-astrocytes were placed in the chamber and cocultured with neurons for 6 more days. The neuronal viability, the redox state [reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG)], the mitochondrial morphology, and the proteins and membrane potential were determined. Our results showed that the neuronal mitochondria functionality was altered after being cocultured with senescent astrocytes. In vivo, we found that old animals had diminished mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins, redox state, and senescence markers as compared to young rats, suggesting effects of the senescent astrocytes similar to the ones we observed in vitro. Overall, these results indicate that the microenvironment generated by senescent astrocytes can affect neuronal mitochondria and physiology.;aging | astrocyte | cellular senescence | mitochondria | redox state;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;FORDECYT-PRONACES/263957/2020;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Alterations in either one of these parameters have been shown to trigger physiological changes that can compromise the welfare of the species and the replicability and robustness of the results obtained. Due to the nature and complexity of evaluating and managing the species involved in research protocols, non‐invasive tools such as infrared thermography (IRT) have been adopted to quantify these parameters without altering them or inducing stress responses in the animals. IRT technology makes it possible to quantify changes in surface temperatures that are derived from alterations in blood flow that can result from inflammatory, stressful, or pathological processes; changes can be measured in diverse regions, called thermal windows, according to their specific characteristics. The principal body regions that were employed for this purpose in laboratory animals were the orbital zone (regio orbitalis), auricular pavilion (regio auricularis), tail (cauda), and the interscapular area (regio scapularis). However, depending on the species and certain external factors, the sensitivity and specificity of these windows are still subject to controversy due to contradictory results published in the available literature. For these reasons, the objectives of the present review are to discuss the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in vasomotor responses and thermogenesis via BAT in laboratory animals and to evaluate the scientific usefulness of IRT and the thermal windows that are currently used in research involving laboratory animals.";Infrared thermography | Laboratory animals | Thermal windows;10;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Clinical medicine considers thermoreg-ulation a mechanism that allows animals to adapt to varying thermal environmental conditions, a process in which the presence of feathers, hair, or glabrous skin influences heat loss or heat retention, respectively, under hot and cold environmental conditions. Evaluating body temperature provides vital information on an individual’s physiological state and health status since variations in euther-mia maintenance in vertebrates reflect a significant cellular metabolism deviation that needs to be assessed and quantified. IRT is a non-invasive tool for evaluating thermal responses under thermal stress conditions in animals, where the presence or absence of feathers, hair, and glabrous skin can affect readings and the differences detected. Therefore, anatomical regions, the characteristics of feathers, hair, glabrous skin such as structure, length, color, and extension, and strategies for dissipating or retaining heat together constitute a broad area of opportunity for future research into the phenomena of dermal thermoregulation in domestic species.;Behavior | Birds | Feathers | Glabrous skin | Hair | Skin | Thermoregulation;15;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if matured cumulus-oocyte complexes exposure to cryoprotectants (CPAs) or vitrification affects oocytes and cumulus cells viability, but also if DNA damage is generated in cumulus cells, affecting fertilization and embryo development. Results: The DNA damage in cumulus cells was measured using the alkaline comet assay and expressed as Comet Tail Length (CTL) and Olive Tail Moment (OTM). Results demonstrate that oocyte exposure to CPAs or vitrification reduced oocyte (75.5 ± 3.69%, Toxicity; 66.7 ± 4.57%, Vitrification) and cumulus cells viability (32.7 ± 5.85%, Toxicity; 7.7 ± 2.21%, Vitrification) compared to control (95.5 ± 4.04%, oocytes; 89 ± 4.24%, cumulus cells). Also, significantly higher DNA damage expressed as OTM was generated in the cumulus cells after exposure to CPAs and vitrification (39 ± 17.41, 33.6 ± 16.69, respectively) compared to control (7.4 ± 4.22). In addition, fertilization and embryo development rates also decreased after exposure to CPAs (35.3 ± 16.65%, 22.6 ± 3.05%, respectively) and vitrification (32.3 ± 9.29%, 20 ± 1%, respectively). It was also found that fertilization and embryo development rates in granulose-intact oocytes were significantly higher compared to denuded oocytes in the control groups. However, a decline in embryo development to the blastocyst stage was observed after CPAs exposure (1.66 ± 0.57%) or vitrification (2 ± 1%) compared to control (22.3 ± 2.51%). This could be attributed to the reduction in both cell types viability, and the generation of DNA damage in the cumulus cells. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that oocyte exposure to CPAs or vitrification reduced viability in oocytes and cumulus cells, and generated DNA damage in the cumulus cells, affecting fertilization and embryo development rates. These findings will allow to understand some of the mechanisms of oocyte damage after vitrification that compromise their developmental capacity, as well as the search for new vitrification strategies to increase fertilization and embryo development rates by preserving the integrity of the cumulus cells.";Cryoprotectants | Cumulus cells | DNA damage | Matured oocytes | Porcine | Vitrification;3;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;598630;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Recent studies indicate that training exercise favors the synthesis and action of angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), a vasoactive peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), in various tissues. Interestingly, Ang-(1-7) also relieves neuropathic pain; however, it remains to be elucidated whether exercise mitigates this type of pain through Ang-(1-7). In this study, we investigated the role of Ang-(1-7) in exercise-induced analgesia in a neuropathic pain model. Male Wistar rats were ligated of lumbar spinal nerves (L5 and L6) or sham-operated. Then, they were subjected to acute (2-h) or chronic (4-week) exercise protocols. Tactile allodynia was evaluated before and after each exercise intervention. Microosmotic pumps were implanted subcutaneously for the release of Ang-(1-7) or A779 (selective Mas receptor (MasR; Ang-(1-7) receptor) antagonist). Plasma levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) were quantified by HPLC. Spinal nerve ligation (SNL) produced tactile allodynia. Both acute and chronic exercise reversed this neuropathic behavior. A779 treatment prevented the antiallodynic effect induced by each exercise protocol. SNL increased the plasma Ang II/Ang-(1-7) ratio; however, exercise did not modify it. Acute treatment with Ang-(1-7) via MasR mimicked exercise-mediated antinociception. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of the Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis of the RAS represents a potential novel mechanism by which exercise attenuates neuropathic pain in rats.";Allodynia | Angiotensin II | Angiotensin-(1-7) | Exercise | Neuropathic pain | Renin-angiotensin system;0;0;;;CONACYT;34604032;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Milk fermentation was carried out inoculating 106 CFU of L. rhamnosus GG, S. thermophilus SY-102 and with both bacteria. The proteolytic profile was determined using: TNBS, SDS-PAGE and SEC-HPLC techniques. In vitro ACE inhibition capacity was measured. The pH of 4.5 was reached at 56 h when the milk was fermented with L. rhamnosus, at 12 h with S. thermophillus and at 41 h in the co-culture. Production of free amino groups corresponded with the profile of low molecular weight peptides observed by SDS-PAGE and SEC-HPLC. Co-culture fermentation showed both the highest concentration of low molecular weight peptides and the ACE inhibitory activity (> 80%). Results indicated that the combination of lactic cultures could be useful in manufacture of fermented milk with an added value that goes beyond basic nutrition, such as the production of ACE-inhibitory peptides.;ACE-inhibitory peptides | Bioactive peptide | Probiotic | Proteolytic profile;2;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;CB-2014-241333;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

For taller buildings on soft soil, however, the following concerns arise: soil-structure interaction (SSI) alters the resonant characteristics of the whole system and its dynamic response. The efficiency of base-isolation depends on the dynamic properties of the system and the shape of the site response spectrum. In this work, SSI effects on the dynamic response of base-isolated mid-rise buildings are examined. A discrete shear-building model with linear elastic elastomeric bearings and flexible foundation is analyzed by a suitable method for systems with non-classical damping. The model is applied to evaluate the feasibility of using seismic isolation at soft-soil sites of Mexico City, where typical buildings of 10–15 stories were the most damaged during the great 1985 Michoacán earthquake. It is concluded that base isolation can be effectively used to control the detrimental SSI effects anticipated for these buildings located at sites with dominant period longer than the fundamental fixed-base period of the superstructure.;Base isolation | Fixed base | Flexible foundation | Site response spectra | Soil-structure interaction;5;0;;;;undefined;

In this work, the purpose was to evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of fractions and compounds isolated from S. elegans and its interaction with serotoninergic drugs by using behavioral tests in mice. Fractions from aerial parts of S. elegans were obtained by column chromatography, SeF1, SeF2, SeF3, and SeF4. Each of them was administered to 25 mg/k in ICR mice subject to forced swimming test (FST), or elevated plus maze test (EPM), or open field test (OFT). The most active fractions were chemically separated until compounds, which were analyzed as anxiolytic or antidepressant and the coadministration of these treatments with 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 drugs was measured in the different biological tests. All fractions were anxiolytic and antidepressant, oleanolic acid (OA) was found in SeF2, and from SeF3, a mixture of terpenes was found; a GC–MS analysis confirmed the presence of two main compounds: rosifoliol and agaraspirol (TM, mixture of terpenes). TM (doses-response curve, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg) and OA (5 mg/kg) were also evaluated demonstrating an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect, respectively. The combination of TM (0.5 mg/kg) with 8-OH (selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist) induced an increment of antidepressant activity, while with the antagonist WAY-100635, the effect diminished. But with DOI (5-HT1c/5-HT2 receptor agonist), there was no change, and with KET (5-HT2 receptor antagonist), the activity was increased. When OA is co-administered with 8-OH or with DOI, the anxiolytic activity of this terpene, diminished; but with the combination with antagonists, the effect of OA shows no change. TM and OA were antidepressant and anxiolytic, respectively, on mice exposed to different tests, and these are able to interact with serotoninergic drugs.";5-HT drugs | Anxiety | Depression | Elevated plus maze | Forced swim test | Salvia elegans;0;0;;;CONACYT;FIS/IMSS/PROT/PRIO/14/029;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

As a consequence, there are few records of parasites from either Regalecus species. We report plerocercoid larvae of phyllobothriidean cestodes parasitizing an adult R. glesne stranded in Bahía de La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Methods: Sixty-three plerocercoids were obtained from the intestine of R. glesne and characterized using morphological and molecular methods (nuclear 28S rDNA and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene sequences). Results: Following the morphological diagnostic criteria of scolex and muscle bands in the strobila, plerocercoids specimens were preliminary assigned to the genus Clistobothrium. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences indicate these plerocercoids correspond to Clistobothrium montaukensis Ruhnke, 1993. Conclusion: Regalecus glesne is a new host known for C. montaukensis and this report is a new geographical record of C. montaukensis parasitizing species of the genus Regalecus previously known only from California and Florida, USA.;28S rDNA | Cestoda | Cox1 | Gulf of California | Oarfish | Regalecidae;0;0;;;CONACYT;20150113;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It is therefore customary to enhance skin colour changes by submitting early citrus varieties to ethylene degreening treatment, which implies a cost and may result in external disorders. In this study, the effect on consumer expectations (sensory and hedonic) of providing them with information about the internal maturity of non-degreened mandarins (greenish-coloured rind) was evaluated. RESULTS: Mandarins with three different external colour indices (CI), CI = −6, CI = +1 and CI = +5, and three ways of conveying information, were investigated: (i) No information (NoInfo), (ii) The text ‘Mandarins ready to eat’ (Text) and (iii) Text + Visualisation of mandarin flesh (orange-coloured in all cases) (Text+Flesh). Consumer expected liking, purchase intention and sensory expectations were markedly affected after receiving the different information types. The greatest effect was detected when Text+Flesh information was provided. Rind mandarin colour was also a determinant factor of how consumer expectations were modified by the received information. Moreover, our results revealed some differences among Spanish and Mexican consumers, since maturity information had a stronger effect on hedonic expectations of Mexican consumers. CONCLUSIONS: When mandarins reach CI = +5 (pale orange-coloured rind with small areas still green), letting consumers know that mandarins are ready to eat by means of Text+Flesh information may be a non-cost strategy to avoid degreening treatment or to shorten its length. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.;CATA questions | expected liking | flesh visualisation | label | purchase intention | rind colour;3;0;;;GVA;PTA2017‐14164‐I;Generalitat Valenciana

However, little is known about how preferred responses to norm violations vary across cultures and across domains. In a preregistered study of 57 countries (using convenience samples of 22,863 students and non-students), we measured perceptions of the appropriateness of various responses to a violation of a cooperative norm and to atypical social behaviors. Our findings highlight both cultural universals and cultural variation. We find a universal negative relation between appropriateness ratings of norm violations and appropriateness ratings of responses in the form of confrontation, social ostracism and gossip. Moreover, we find the country variation in the appropriateness of sanctions to be consistent across different norm violations but not across different sanctions. Specifically, in those countries where use of physical confrontation and social ostracism is rated as less appropriate, gossip is rated as more appropriate.;;24;1;repositoryam;Green;RJ;P17-0030:1;Riksbankens Jubileumsfond

The aim of this work is to search for specific features that can help physicians recognize this disease. Methods: This study included 84 FHTG cases, 728 subjects with common mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (CHTG) and 609 normotriglyceridemic controls. All subjects underwent genetic, clinical and biochemical assessments. A set of 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with triglycerides levels, as well as 37 rare variants within the five main genes associated with hypertriglyceridemia (i.e. LPL, APOC2, APOA5, LMF1 and GPIHBP1) were analyzed. A panel of endocrine regulatory proteins associated with triglycerides homeostasis were compared between the FHTG and CHTG groups. Results: Apolipoprotein B, fibroblast growth factor 21(FGF-21), angiopoietin-like proteins 3 (ANGPTL3) and apolipoprotein A-II concentrations, were independent components of a model to detect FHTG compared with CHTG (AUC 0.948, 95%CI 0.901–0.970, 98.5% sensitivity, 92.2% specificity, P < 0.001). The polygenic set of SNPs, accounted for 1.78% of the variance in triglyceride levels in FHTG and 6.73% in CHTG. Conclusions: The clinical and genetic differences observed between FHTG and CHTG supports the notion that FHTG is a unique entity, distinguishable from other causes of hypertriglyceridemia by the higher concentrations of insulin, FGF-21, ANGPTL3, apo A-II and lower levels of apo B. We propose the inclusion of these parameters as useful markers for differentiating FHTG from other causes of hypertriglyceridemia.;ANGPTL3 | Apolipoprotein B | Chylomicronemia | Familial hypertriglyceridemia | FGF-21 | Mexicans | Primary dyslipidemias;5;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;169342;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

While a number of genes and variants have been identified in recent decades as causative or protective agents of this condition, a limited number of studies have been conducted in mixed populations, such as Mexican Mestizos. The historical convergence of two founding groups and three ethnicities, and the increasing north-to-south gradient of Native American ancestry in Mexico resulted in a subpopulation structure with considerable genetic diversity. In this work, we investigate the influence of 21 known susceptibility variants for PD. Our case–control study, with a cohort of 311 Mexican Mestizo subjects, found a significant risk association for the variant rs1491942 in LRRK2. However, when stratification by ancestry was performed, a risk effect for MTHFR rs1801133 was observed only in the group with the highest percentage of European ancestry, and the PD risk effect for LRRK2 rs1491942 was significant in subjects with a higher ratio of Native American ancestry. Meta-analyses of these SNP revealed the effect of LRRK2 rs1491942 to be even more significant than previously described in populations of European descent. Although corroboration is necessary, our findings suggest that polymorphism rs1491942 may be useful as a risk marker of PD in Mexican Mestizos with greater Native American ancestry. The absence of associations with the remaining known risk factors is, in itself, a relevant finding and invites further research into the shared risk factors’ role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of this neurodegenerative disorder.;;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;FOSISS 2015:262327;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

During ageing, histological alterations in the epididymis and decreased protein synthesis have been found. This might affect the sperm maturation process. The aim of this study was to determine if the changes in the epididymis during ageing might cause alterations in sperm maturation. Wistar rats of 3-4 months old (young) and 18-21 months old (old) were used. The testosterone concentration was determined and the epididymides were dissected and divided in three regions: caput, corpus, and cauda. The tissues were used for histological processing and sperm extraction. Testosterone concentration decreased 34% in the old animals compared to the young ones. The distribution of mannose, sialic acid, and N-acetylglucosamine in the glycocalyx of the sperm membrane of old animals was different from that of young animals. The same occurred with phosphatidylserine externalisation and protein phosphorylation at tyrosine residues. Epididymis histology in old animals showed tubular and cellular degeneration. Our results suggest that ageing affects maturational markers, likely due to alterations in the epididymis as a result of the testosterone decrease associated with ageing.;ageing | epididymis | externalization of phosphatidylserine | membrane carbohydrates | rats | sperm | sperm maturation | testosterone | tyrosine phosphorylation;0;0;;;CONACYT;CD.CBS.373.2017;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Due to their close co-existence with humans, broad attention has been given to identifying these expressions in certain species, especially dogs. This review aims to analyze and discuss the advances in identifying the facial expressions of domestic dogs and their clinical utility in recognizing pain as a method to improve daily practice and, in an accessible and effective way, assess the health outcome of dogs. This study focuses on aspects related to the anatomy and physiology of facial expressions in dogs, their emotions, and evaluations of their eyebrows, eyes, lips, and ear positions as changes that reflect pain or nociception. In this regard, research has found that dogs have anatomical configurations that allow them to generate changes in their expressions that similar canids—wolves, for example—cannot produce. Additionally, dogs can perceive emotions similar to those of their human tutors due to close human-animal interaction. This phenomenon—called “emotional contagion”—is triggered precisely by the dog’s capacity to identify their owners’ gestures and then react by emitting responses with either similar or opposed expressions that correspond to positive or negative stimuli, respectively. In conclusion, facial expressions are essential to maintaining social interaction between dogs and other species, as in their bond with humans. Moreover, this provides valuable information on emotions and the perception of pain, so in dogs, they can serve as valuable elements for recognizing and evaluating pain in clinical settings.;Animal welfare | Emotions | Human-dog interaction | Pain | Positive and negative stimuli;10;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The WHO classifies temephos in category III and its safe concentration (low-observable-adverse-effect level) in male rats is 100 mg/kg/day for up to 44 days. Temephos inhibits acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and is metabolized in different tissues, probably by mixed-function oxidases; one of its metabolites is bisphenol S (BPS), which is considered an endocrine disruptor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of temephos on sperm function and its biotransformation in the testis, epididymis, and other tissues to explore its toxicity in rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day/5 or 7 days (gavage). AChE activity was inhibited 70% starting on day 3 and 13 or 41% mortality was observed at 5 or 7 days, respectively. After 7 days, temephos significantly decreased sperm motility (30%) and viability (10%) and increased (10%) lipoperoxidation, and the sperm DNA exhibited no damage. Temephos was distributed and metabolized in all tissues, with the highest levels observed in the adipose tissue and temephos levels were 16-fold higher in the epididymis than in the testis. Notably, BPS was observed in the testis. At 5 days, decreased sperm motility (12.5%) and viability (5.7%) were observed and sperm fertilization decreased (30%). These results suggest that temephos decreases sperm quality and fertilization capacity at recommended safe concentrations and that it is metabolized in male reproductive tissues. This pesticide places the reproductive health of exposed people at risk, suggesting the need to reevaluate its toxicity.";biotransformation | organophosphorus pesticides | sperm fertilization | sperm quality | temephos;1;0;;;;undefined;

The study was carried out in La Serena city, region of Coquimbo, Chile and 22 semi-intensive dairy goat farms were assessed using the Animal Welfare Indicators protocol. In each evaluation, the following indicators and information were gathered: physical and behavioural indicators of animal welfare, farmers' sociodemographic information, farm facilities, husbandry practices and management of the farm, and farmers' perception of animal welfare. Of the goats evaluated (n = 446), the vast majority had a body condition score (BCS) considered normal (n = 349; 78.25%). The main welfare problems were poor hair condition, faecal soiling, overgrown claws and improper disbudding or dehorning. The majority of farmers (96%) considered it 'rather important' or 'very important' to handle their goats in a gentle manner, expressing concern about the welfare of their animals and considering pain as a negative experience for goats. A lower than expected percentage of very thin animals (low BCS) were seen, considering the drought conditions and the forage shortage that affects the region, and no animals were observed with signs of thermal stress.

Anthropomorphism is defined as the tendency to attribute human forms, behaviors, and emotions to non-human animals or objects. Anthropomorphism is particularly relevant for companion animals. Some anthropomorphic practices can be beneficial to them, whilst others can be very detrimental. Some anthropomorphic behaviors compromise the welfare and physiology of animals by interfering with thermoregulation, while others can produce dehydration due to the loss of body water, a condition that brings undesirable consequences such as high compensatory blood pressure and heat shock, even death, depending on the intensity and frequency of an animal’s exposure to these stressors. Malnutrition is a factor observed due to consumption of junk food or an imbalance in caloric proportions. This can cause obesity in pets that may have repercussions on their locomotor apparatus. Intense human–animal interaction can also lead to the establishment of attachment that impacts the mental state and behavior of animals, making them prone to develop aggression, fear, or anxiety separation syndrome. Another aspect is applying cosmetics to pets, though scientific studies have not yet determined whether cosmetic products such as coat dyes, nail polish, and lotions are beneficial or harmful for the animals, or to what extent. The cohabitation of animals in people’s homes can also constitute a public health risk due to infectious and zoonotic diseases. In this context, this paper aims to analyze the adverse effects of anthropomorphism on the welfare of companion animals from several angles—physiological, sanitary, and behavioral—based on a discussion of current scientific findings.;Attachment | Behavior | Emotions | Health | Human–animal interaction | Malnutrition | Pet clothes | Zoonoses;9;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Agroforestry systems, especially home gardens, are experiencing reduced size and species diversity and therefore gradually disappearing. This research aims to determine the indigenous family labor contribution to agroforestry systems as a strategy to secure their livelihoods. The methods include a census, household survey, interviews with key informants, and direct observation. Family labor contributes to reducing production costs in agroforestry systems. Three groups of households were identified from the cluster analysis to determine the family labor contribution: smaller, medium-sized, and larger farms. The smaller farms register better economic indicators compared to the other two groups. In addition, they show a positive cost–benefit ratio and profitability, which is explained by lower production costs compared to the gross income generated. Although larger farms have higher gross revenues, these households also assume higher production costs and incur higher input costs. Medium-sized farms face the worst scenario. There is a relationship between the use of family labor and the achievement of livelihoods related to economic indicators and biodiversity and the variety of species harvested on farms and used for self-consumption. Family labor helps to ensure local food security and generate income.;;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded in the cag pathogenicity island is the main virulence factor of H. pylori associated with GC. Additionally, other virulence factors have been shown to play a role in the H. pylori virulence, such as vacuolizing cytotoxin (VacA), urease, flagella, and adhesins. Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are signaling molecules that affect the transcription of virulence genes in several pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the effect of LCFAs on the transcription of H. pylori virulence and regulatory genes remains unknown. Here we analyzed whether the transcription of virulence genes that encode T4SS and cellular envelope components, flagellins, adhesins, toxins, urease, as well as the transcription of different regulatory genes of the H. pylori strain 26695, are altered by the presence of five distinct LCFAs: palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. Palmitic and oleic acids up-regulated the transcription of most of the virulence genes tested, including cagL, cagM, flaB, sabA, mraY and vacA, as well as that of the genes encoding the transcriptional regulators NikR, Fur, CheY, ArsR, FlgR, HspR, HsrA, Hup, and CrdR. In contrast, the other LCFAs differentially affected the transcription of the virulence and regulatory genes assessed. Our data show that LCFAs can act as signaling molecules that control the transcription of the H. pylori virulome.;Helicobacter pylori | LCFA | Transcription | Virulence factors;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Using Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and PubMed databases, a systematic search was performed for studies published in scientific journals that investigated the effects of TANs supplementation on the variables of interest. Only studies with weaned or older sheep were included. The data analyzed were extracted from 53 peer-reviewed publications. The sheep included in the present study were between 2 and 6 months old, and between 12 and 31 kg of body weight. The effects of TANs were analyzed using random-effects statistical models to examine the standardized mean difference (SMD) between treatments with TANs and control (no TANs). Heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression and a subgroup analysis was performed for covariates that were significant. Supplementation with TANs did not affect dry matter intake, pH, color (L* and b*), Warner–Bratzler shear force, cooking loss and meat chemical composition (p > 0.05). Supplementation with TANs increased daily weight gain (SMD = 0.274, p < 0.05), total antioxidant capacity (SMD = 1.120, p < 0.001), glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity (SMD = 0.801, p < 0.001) and catalase (SMD = 0.848, p < 0.001), and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in blood serum (SMD = −0.535, p < 0.05). Supplementation with TANs decreased feed conversion rate (SMD = −0.246, p < 0.05), and the concentration of MDA (SMD = −2.020, p < 0.001) and metmyoglobin (SMD = −0.482, p < 0.05) in meat.

Even though lactation demands high energy expenditures, behaviors known as allonursing (the nursing of non-descendant infants) and allosuckling (suckling from any female other than the mother) have been reported in various species of wild or domestic, and terrestrial or aquatic animals. These behaviors seem to be elements of a multifactorial strategy, since reports suggest that they depend on the following: species, living conditions, social stability, and kinship relations, among other group factors. Despite their potential benefits, allonursing and allosuckling can place the health and welfare of both non-filial dams and alien offspring at risk, as it augments the probability of pathogen transmission. This review aims to analyze the biological and physiological foundations and bioenergetic costs of these behaviors, analyzing the individual and collective advantages and disadvantages for the dams’ own offspring(s) and alien neonate(s).

This study aimed to determine whether flagella-, type I fimbriae-, and curli-expressing UPEC induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines in an established coculture system. Methods. The fliC, fimH, and csgA genes by UPEC strain were disrupted by allelic replacement. Flagella, type I fimbriae, and curli were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). HTB-5 (upper chamber) and HMC-1 (lower chamber) cells cocultured in Transwell® plates were infected with these UPEC strains and purified proteins. There was adherence to HTB-5 cells treated with different UPEC strains and they were quantified as colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Results. High concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were induced by the FimH and FliC proteins; however, these cytokines were detected in low concentrations in presence of CsgA. Compared with UPEC CFT073, CFT073∆fimH, CFT073∆fimH∆fliC, and CFT073∆csgA∆fimH strains significantly reduced the adherence to HTB-5 cells. Conclusion. The FimH and FliC proteins are involved in IL-6 and IL-8 release in a coculture model of HTB-5 and HMC-1 cells.";Adherence | Coculture | Cytokines | Fimbriae | UPEC;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;HIMFG;undefined;Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez

These characteristics are related to its physical and chemical composition. For example, phenolic compounds are substances that can determine antioxidant activity, as well as sensory char-acteristics, and can be employed as biomarkers of floral and geographical origin. This has generated a growing interest in the study of phenolic compounds and their influence in the intrinsic properties of this beekeeping product. This review aims to summarize, analyze, and update the status of the research that demonstrates the role of phenolic compounds in antioxidant activity, botanical‐geo-graphical origin, and the sensory characteristics of honey. These phenolic compounds, according to various results reported, have great relevance in honey’s biological and functional activity. This leads to research that will link phenolic compounds to their floral, geographical, productive, and territorial origin, as well as some sensory and functional characteristics.;Antioxidants | Flavonoids | Honey | Honeybee | Polyphenols;17;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Different plant growth regulator concentrations (0–5 mg/L) were tested in foliar explants to induce a callus that was used to establish a cell suspension culture. Growth kinetics was carried out for 30 days. A methanolic extract obtained from biomass harvested at 30 days of growth kinetics was fractionated, and three fractions were tested for bioactivities. We induced a callus with 1 mg/L of picloram and 0.5 mg/L of kinetin in foliar explants, which allowed for the establishment of a cell suspension culture, and the latter had the highest total SMs contents at day 30. Three fractions showed differences in total SMs con-tents, with the highest values per gram as follows: 270 mg gallic acid equivalent for total phenolic content, 200 mg quercetin equivalent for total flavonoid content, 83 mg verbascoside equivalent for total phenolic acid content, and 396 mg parthenolide equivalent for total sesquiterpene lactone con-tent. The best bioactivities were 2–6 µg/mL for the 50% inhibition of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, 30% cellular viability of lymphoma cells at 40 µg/mL, 17% inhibition against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at 8 µg/disk, and α-amylase inhibition at 12% with 10 µg/mL.

To facilitate detection and isolation of members of this group of spore-forming bacteria from Mexican chili powder samples, we identified colonies that grew on agar medium selective for Bacillus cereus sensu lato, supplemented with polymyxin B (10 µg/mL) and ampicillin (10 to 100 µg/mL). The presumptive B. cereus (s.l.) isolates were tested using a tRNACys-PCR-based approach and the results identified species related phylogenetically to B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. toyonensis. Their toxigenic potential was assessed by serological tests to detect enterotoxins (Nhe and Hbl) and by PCR targeting the hemolysin BL (hbl) component C (hblC) and non-hemolytic enterotoxin component A (nheA). The antibiotic profiles of the isolates showed a high resistance to β-lactams (100% of the isolates), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (100%), tetracycline (90%), erythromycin (77%), clindamycin (74%), and chloramphenicol (42%). Our results indicate the presence of B. cereus s.l. with toxigenic characteristics in Mexican chili powder. Because of the potential for these organisms to cause disease through their production of various toxins, and resistance to antibiotics, we recommend that a microbiological risk assessment must be considered in the Mexican regulatory requirements.;Antibiotics resistance | Bacillus cereus sensu lato | Mexican chili powder | TRNA -PCR Cys;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;UAQ;FONDEC-UAQ-2019-FCQ202001;Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro

Large litter sizes are known to promote alterations in memory processes and anxiety-like behavior. Nevertheless, the effect of large litter size on sexual behavior and the reproductive system is still unknown. Environmental enrichment has been reported to (EE) enhance behavior and to correct some of the alterations produced by postnatal undernutrition. We used the Elevated Plus Maze (EPN), Morris Water Maze (MWM), Object Recognition test (OR) and several parameters of sexual behavior to determine the effect of large litter size on rats exposed to enriched and non-enriched environments. Newborn Wistar rats of both sexes were assigned to be suckled under lactation conditions, in litters of 8 pups or 16 pups. The large litter size (16 pups) caused a reduction in weight gain during the lactation period. On PND 45, four experimental groups were established for both sexes: Well-nourished Non-enriched (WN); Well-nourished Enriched (WE); undernourished Non-enriched (UN); Undernourished Enriched (UE). On PND 90, the UN males spent more time in the open arms on EPM. On PND 100, the UE females increased the latency to find the platform in training days (D1-4) in MWM. On probe day (D5) the UE males spent more time in the target quadrants in MWM. On PND 110, irrespective of EE the large litter size had increased the exploration time in both groups (UN) and (UE) in OR test. On PND 120, the performance of sexual behavior was more evident by effect of EE irrespective of the litter size. In conclusion, the large litter size showed no effects on sexual behavior, in contrast, EE has a sharp influence on sexual behavior.

The last one involves removing the anti-association factor eIF6 from the 60S ribosomal surface by the joint action of the Elongation Factor-like 1 (EFL1) GTPase and the SBDS protein. Herein, we studied the evolutionary relationship of the EFL1 and EF-2 protein families and the functional conservation within EFL1 orthologues. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the EFL1 proteins are exclusive of eukaryotes and share an evolutionary origin with the EF-2 and EF-G protein families. EFL1 proteins originated by gene duplication from the EF-2 proteins and specialized in ribosome maturation while the latter retained their function in translation. Some organisms have more than one EFL1 protein resulting from alternative splicing, while others are encoded in different genes originated by gene duplication. However, the function of these alternative EFL1 proteins is still unknown. We performed GTPase activity and complementation assays to study the functional conservation of EFL1 homologs alone and together with their SBDS counterparts. None of the orthologues or cross-species combinations could replace the function of the corresponding yeast EFL1•SBDS binomial. The complementation of SBDS interspecies chimeras indicates that domain 2 is vital for its function together with EFL1 and the 60S subunit. The results suggest a functional species-specificity and possible co-evolution between EFL1, SBDS, and the 60S ribosomal subunit. These findings set the basis for further studies directed to understand the molecular evolution of these proteins and their impact on ribosome biogenesis and disease.;EFL1 | Evolutionary conservation | Genetic complementation | SBDS;0;0;;;CONACYT;283909;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Effective therapies to avoid secondary mechanisms underlying SCI are still lacking. The recent progression in circular RNAs (circRNAs) research has drawn increasing attention and opened a new insight on SCI pathology. circRNAs differ from traditional linear RNAs and have emerged as the active elements to regulate gene expression as well as to facilitate the immune response involved in pathophysiology-related conditions. In this review, we focus on the impact and possible close relationship of circRNAs with pathophysiological mechanisms following SCI, where circRNAs could be the key transcriptional regulatory molecules to define neuronal death or survival.

CBZ-induced adverse drug reactions were related to antiepileptic polytherapy and SCN1A rs2298771/rs3812718 haplotype. CBZ plasma concentrations were influenced by NR1I2-rs2276707 and -rs3814058, and by phenytoin cotreatment. CBZ daily dose was also influenced by NR1I2-rs3814055 and EPHX1-rs1051740. Conclusion: Interindividual variability in CBZ treatment was partly explained by NR1I2, EPHX1 and SCN1A variants, as well as antiepileptic cotreatment in MM with epilepsy.;ABCC2 | carbamazepine | EPHX1 | epilepsy | NR1I2 | pharmacogenetics;0;0;;;CONACYT;167261;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

worldwide. Here we map annual 2000–2018 geospatial estimates of anemia prevalence in women of reproductive age (15–49 years) across 82 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), stratify anemia by severity and aggregate results to policy-relevant administrative and national levels. Additionally, we provide subnational disparity analyses to provide a comprehensive overview of anemia prevalence inequalities within these countries and predict progress toward the World Health Organization’s Global Nutrition Target (WHO GNT) to reduce anemia by half by 2030. Our results demonstrate widespread moderate improvements in overall anemia prevalence but identify only three LMICs with a high probability of achieving the WHO GNT by 2030 at a national scale, and no LMIC is expected to achieve the target in all their subnational administrative units. Our maps show where large within-country disparities occur, as well as areas likely to fall short of the WHO GNT, offering precision public health tools so that adequate resource allocation and subsequent interventions can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations.;;22;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0084;National Institutes of Health

Labour is a crucial moment for numerous species and is usually the most painful experience in females. Contrary to the extensive research in humans, there are limited pain studies associated with the birth process in domestic animals. Nonetheless, awareness of parturition has increased among the public, owners, and the scientific community during recent years. Dystocia is a significant factor that increases the level of parturition pain. It is considered less common in polytocous species because newborns’ number and small size might lead to the belief that the parturition process is less painful than in monotocous animal species and humans. This review aims to provide elements of the current knowledge about human labour pain (monotocous species), the relevant contribution of the rat model to human labour pain, and the current clinical and experimental knowledge of parturition pain mechanisms in domestic animals that support the fact that domestic polytocous species also experience pain. Moreover, both for women and domestic animal species, parturition’s pain represents a potential welfare concern, and information on pain indicators and the appropriate analgesic therapy are discussed.;Delivery | Distress | Farrowing | Labour | Pain | parturition | Whelping;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In recent years, buffalo production has been incorporated into the region, with possibilities for development in profitable and sustainable models. To study this option in depth, a broad bibliographic review was carried out focusing on the ecological characteristics of tropical zones and the physiological and productive characteristics of buffaloes. We also investigated the structure and functioning of dual‐purpose systems that have worked in cattle and that can be optimized with this alternative animal species. The possibility of taking sustainable advantage of abundant forage resources in the region was detected through intensive grazing models, as well as agrosilvopastoral systems, due to the gregarious qualities of buffaloes and responding to their thermoregulation needs. In this way, the productive and regenerative capacities of the dual‐purpose system could be increased, as well as the quality of meat and milk, which could be marketed as differentiated products, taking advantage of their outstanding nutritional qualities. Integral management of the dual‐purpose system is proposed, retaking the bases of the original model of family characters, diversified and with low investments and risks, which with specific innovations can be an effective development option for producers in the region.;;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Thirty-six Dorper × Katahdin lambs (23.27 ± 1.23 kg body weight (BW)) were housed in individual pens and were assigned to four treatments (n = 9) with different doses of HM: 0 (CON), 1 (HM1), 2 (HM2) and 3 (HM3) g of HM kg−1 of DM for 56 days. Data were analysed as a completely randomized design using the MIXED and GLM procedures of statistical analysis system (SAS), and linear and quadratic effects were tested to evaluate the effects of the HM level. DM digestibility decreased in lambs fed HM3 (p < 0.05). There was no effect of HM on daily weight gain, dry matter intake, final BW, feed conversion, carcass characteristics, colour (L* and a*) and meat chemical composition. Meat pH, cooking loss and drip loss increased linearly (p < 0.05) when the HM dose was increased. The Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) of meat was lower (p < 0.05) in lambs fed HM3. In conclusion, dietary inclusion of 3 g HM kg1 of DM improves meat tenderness. However, high doses of HM in the diet may decrease the digestibility of DM and increase the cooking loss and drip loss of lamb meat during the final fattening period.;Bioactive compounds | Fattening lamb | Mutton tenderness | Saponins;5;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The objective of this review article is to present the current knowledge on the factors that cause stress in fighting bulls during bullfights, including their dying process, by discussing the neurobiology and their physiological responses. The literature shows that biochemical imbalances occur during bullfights, including hypercalcaemia, hypermagnesaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperlactataemia, and hyperglycaemia, associated with increased endogenous cortisol and catecholamine levels. Creatine kinase, citrate synthase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels also increase, coupled with decreases in pH, blood bi-carbonate levels, excess base, partial oxygen pressure, and oxygen saturation. The intense exercise also causes a marked decrease of glycogen in type I and II muscle fibres that can produce myoglobinuria and muscular necrosis. Other observations suggest the presence of osteochondrosis. The existing information allows us to conclude that during bullfights, bulls face energy and metabolic demands due to the high intensity and duration of the exercise performed, together with muscular injuries, physiological changes, and high enzyme concentrations. In addition, the final stage of the bullfight causes a slow dying process for an animal that is sentient and conscious of its surroundings.;Abattoir | Animal welfare | Cattle | Fighting bulls | Pain | Sensitisation | Stunning;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The formation of these organs is controlled by two gene categories: floral organ identity genes and organ boundary genes, which may function individually or jointly during flower development. Although the floral organogenesis of H. coronarium has been studied at the morphological level, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in particular organ morphologies that emerge in flower development still remain poorly understood. Here, we used comparative transcriptomics combined with Real-time quantitative PCR to investigate gene expression patterns of ABC-class genes in H. coronarium flowers, as well as the homolog of PETAL LOSS (HcPTL). Our studies found that stamen/petal identity or stamen fertility in H. coronarium was not necessarily correlated with the differential expression of HcAP3 and HcAG. We also found a novel spatio-temporal expression pattern for HcPTL mRNA, suggesting it may have evolved a lineage-specific role in the morphogenesis of the Hedychium flower. Our study provides a new transcriptome reference and a functional hypothesis regarding the role of a boundary gene in organ fusion that should be further addressed through phylogenetic analyzes of this gene, as well as functional studies.;Floral organ fusion | Floral organ identity specification | Flower development | Hedychium coronarium | PETAL LOSS | Transcriptome;0;0;repositoryam;Green;NSFC;31200246;National Natural Science Foundation of China

The characteristics analyzed were body weight at 12 (W12), 14 (W14), and 21 (W21) weeks in family cages within tanks in a genetic nucleus and weight at harvest at 19 weeks. The WFS was carried out employing a size grading machine. Three linear mixed multivariate models were used for data analysis. The base model (Model I) considered as fixed effects for W12, W14, and W21 the tank and the population density inside the cage; and for the weight at harvest the tank and the sex, and the age covariate, as random effects, the additive and common genetic effects of siblings in all the models were considered. To correct for the effects of WFS, Model II included the initial weight at W14 and W21, while Model III included the selection intensity, respectively. The variance components estimated with Models I and III are essentially the same, while with Model II, there is a decrease in the additive variances for weight at 14 and 21 weeks. The heritabilities are between 0.22 and 0.61, while the significant genetic correlations range from 0.44 to 0.51. On the one hand, the results indicate that the multistage within-family selection processes for body weight can interfere in the estimation of the components of (co) variance. Moreover, on the other hand, the (co)variance components estimated for all weights evaluated in this study allow considering selection responses correlated to harvest weight with different degrees of efficiency; however, it is necessary to carry out studies that value responses from a cost-benefit approach in selection programs of this type in Litopenaeus vannamei.";Body weight | Genetic parameters | Litopenaeus vannamei | Multistage within-family selection;0;0;;;;184260 y No1999400 (2012 y 2013;

In this review, we discuss how chronic sleep restriction induces metabolic and cognitive impairments that could result in the development of AD in late life. Here, we integrate evidence regarding mechanisms whereby metabolic signaling becomes disturbed after short or chronic sleep restriction in the context of cognitive impairment, particularly in the accumulation of Aβ in the brain. We also discuss the role of the blood-brain barrier in sleep restriction with an emphasis on the transport of metabolic signals into the brain and Aβ clearance. This review presents the unexplored possibility that the alteration of peripheral metabolic signals induced by sleep restriction, especially insulin resistance, is responsible for cognitive deficit and, subsequently, implicated in AD development.;Alzheimer’s disease | cognitive function | insulin resistance | metabolism | sleep restriction;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;936131;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Natural cycles and increases in temperature and droughts worldwide are being caused by the climate change effect. In addition, greenhouse gases (GHG) produced by anthropogenic causes are released to atmosphere. In this way, ruminants contribute with 30% of the total methane produced, whereas in Mexico this value represents over 50%. Since droughts are more frequent, production of forage sources which require more water are decreasing alarmingly. Due to the latter, researchers are looking for alternative forages which may alleviate this issue; Opuntia ficus-indica arises as a good forage source. Objective. To evaluate the effect of the solid state fermentation (SSF) of prickly pear with yeast cultures on in vitro gas production, ruminal fermentation parameters and in situ degradability. Methodology. Three experimental treatments were evaluated: Solely prickly pear without previous SSF with yeast cultures (PP) as a control; PP+SC, previously fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae; and PP+KM, previously fermented with Kluyveromyces marxianus ITD00262. Treatments were fermented with ruminal liquor and dry matter and protein degradabilities, as well as ruminal fermentation parameters and gas production kinetics were measured. Results. The results obtained showed that total degradability of DM increased due to yeast pretreatment (p<0.05). Crude protein degradability and total VFA decreased with PP+SC; however, PP+SC increased total gas production (p<0.05). Otherwise, PP+KM increased propionate production and decreased methane and CO2 production (p<0.05). Implications. The information presented in this research is focused in the use of PP pretreated with yeast strains in order to increase the nutritional value by increasing its protein content. In addition, the presence of yeast cultures in feedstuffs contributes to decrease the methane synthesis in rumen. Additionally, the use of PP in arid and semiarid zones may increase the water availability for ruminants. Conclusion: The use of PP pretreated with strains of Kluyveromyces marxianus into livestock feeding increases the protein availability and contributes to a reduction in the in vitro methane synthesis in 23%.";gas production kinetics | Kluyveromyces marxianus | Saccharomyces cerevisiae | solid state fermentation;0;0;;;;undefined;

The calorific power determination was carried out by means a calorimetric combustion pump and of a gravimetric thermal analysis, GTA and differential thermal analysis technique, DTA, which is quite similar to the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In general, the results showed that the calorific value estimated by analysis (GTA-DTA) is in all cases slightly lower than those estimated with a calorimetric pump, but in general, both results are very close between each other. Maximum variation between these values is within ± 5%, which is associated in a range within the uncertainty of the measurements made. For the nopal wood, it was found that the calorific value, estimated by GTA-DTA, reaches (11 275 kJ/kg), resulting very similar to the value determined with a calorimetric pump, (11 605 kJ/kg). In the other cases studied a greater discrepancy between the measured values was found. The elementary analysis of the woods and their ashes estimated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), allows the determination of the carbon intensity of the woods, and indicates that there is no evidence of toxic metals such as those from coal, which shows that these woods are a sustainable and renewable product, when they are available for combustion and heat energy obtainment.;Calorific power | Calorimetric pump | Carbon intensity | Differential thermal analysis;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

The lignocellulosic biomass that comes from agricultural residues, crops dedicated to wood energy, lignocellulosic biological residues as food by-products, kitchen scraps from homes, restaurants, and commercial premises, as well as cultivated algae, can be considered raw materials for the development of the bioeconomy. Since its composition is mainly based on cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin; they can be used to produce various value-added products from bio-construction blocks in integrated bio-refinery processes. Objective. To stablish the importance of using biomass as a raw material for its incorporation in circular economy models in biorefinery processes, such as considerations of biomass management and pretreatment of biomass, the intrinsic potential for obtaining substances of commercial value depending on the carbon chain. Development. Approximately 90 % of lignocellulosic dry matter consists of cellulose (30-60 %), hemicellulose (20-40 %), and lignin (10-25 %) interrelated in a heteromatrix, while the remainder consists of ash and extracts. It is estimated that the biomass-based power generation potential in Costa Rica ranges close to 600 MW and active projects that generate about 122 MW have been identified. Conclusion. The use of biomass is an important element to be incorporated into the production of bioenergy and the development of a renewable chemical industry that leads to the achievement of objectives framed in the development of a bio-economic model, where Costa Rica has begun its parallel incursion to the advance of the 21st century.";Bioconstruction blocks | Bioenergy | Biomass composition | Biomaterials;1;0;;;;PRY-044-2016;

Tramadol is a widely prescribed analgesic drug for dogs and cats; it has a synthetic partial agonism on μ-opioid receptors and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. However, the biotransformation and resultant metabolites differ between species and depend on cytochrome interactions. Dogs mainly produce the inactive N-desmethyl tramadol metabolite, whereas cats exhibit an improved antinociceptive effect owing to rapid active O-desmethyltramadol metabolite production and a longer elimination half-life. Tapentadol, a novel opioid with dual action on μ-receptors and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitory activity, is a promising option in dogs, as it is less reliant on metabolic activation and is unaffected by cytochrome polymorphisms. Although scientific evidence on the analgesic activity of tapentadol in both species remains limited, experimental studies indicate potential benefits in animals. This review summarizes and compares the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy of tramadol and tapentadol in dogs and cats with different pain conditions. According to the available data, tramadol seems a more suitable therapeutic option for cats and should preferably be used as a component of multimodal analgesia in both species, particularly dogs.

The process involves the adherence of the parasite to the cell, and such adherence is mediated by an amoebic surface lectin, known as Gal/GalNAc lectin. It is composed of heavy, intermediate, and light subunits. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) has been identified within a cysteine-rich region in the lectin heavy subunit and has an amino acid sequence identity to the receptor-binding domain of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Recombinant CRD has been previously shown to compete with HGF for binding to the c-Met receptor IgG fusion protein. In the present study, we searched for evidence of interaction between the Gal/GalNAc lectin at the surface of trophozoites with the c-Met receptor expressed at the surface of HepG2 in coculture assays. Immunoprecipitation of the coculture lysate indicated interaction of the c-Met with a 60 kDa peptide recognized by antiamoebic lectin antibody. Colocalization of both molecules was detected by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Incubation of HepG2 cells with HGF before coculture with trophozoites prevents the cytotoxic effect caused by the parasites but not their adherence to the cells. Our results point to Gal/GalNAc lectin as a ligand of the c-Met receptor at the surface of HepG2 cells.;C-Met receptor | Entamoeba histolytica cytotoxicity | Gal/GalNAc lectin;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;UNAM;216217;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

Relevant peer-reviewed literature published between 1980 and 2021 was retrieved from CAB Abstracts, PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases. Although animals were used to produce draught power since their domestication and are still being used for this purpose, mechanisation has markedly reduced animal labour demand in agriculture. However, the process was uneven across continents according to economic constraints, and draught animals are currently concentrated in small production units located on terrains that do not favour agriculture mechanisation in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Generally, equids can work at rates similar to those of bovids or faster but can sustain the work for shorter periods of time. In addition, buffaloes possess tough hooves and resistance to disease that make them suitable for working in wetlands and clay soils. Draught animals allow a marked reduction of both GHG emissions and non-renewable energy consumption as compared with agricultural machinery. In addition, they may allow obtaining profits from otherwise non-usable lands. Therefore, their use should be promoted in rural areas where low investments are usually the only ones feasible, and the energy of the animals can be obtained at a low cost by feeding them harvest residues and by-products. However, more attention should be paid to the quality of human–animal interactions—due to the close contact between animals and humans while working—and to the welfare of draught animals when transported and slaughtered—due to the high prevalence of injuries they suffer when subjected to these practices.;Animal welfare | Bovids | Buffaloes | Cattle | Donkeys | Draught animals | Equids | Greenhouse gas emission | Horses | Rural activities;12;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Biomaterials used as scaffolds can solve some of the problems that cell therapies currently have, plasma polymerized pyrrole (PPPy) is a biomaterial that has been shown to promote cell adhesion and survival. The present research aimed to study PPPy nanoparticles (PPPyN) interaction with adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (ARVC), to explore whether PPPyN could be employed as a nanoscaffold and develop cardiac microtissues. PPPyN with a mean diameter of 330 nm were obtained, the infrared spectrum showed that some pyrrole rings are fragmented and that some fragments of the ring can be dehydrogenated during plasma synthesis, it also showed the presence of amino groups in the structure of PPPyN. PPPyN had a significant impact on the ARVC´s shape, delaying dedifferentiation, necrosis, and apoptosis processes, moreover, the cardiomyocytes formed cell aggregates up to 1.12 mm2 with some aligned cardiomyocytes and generated fibers on its surface similar to cardiac extracellular matrix. PPPyN served as a scaffold for adult ARVC. Our results indicate that PPPyN-scaffold is a biomaterial that could have potential application in cardiac cell therapy (CCT).

To evaluate DEB, we applied a validated scale. We identified three factors from DEB by factorial analysis: restrictive, compensatory, and binge–purge be-haviors. The main events were GWG and offspring’s birth weight and length. We performed linear regression models. We found that 50% of adolescents have at least one DEB. Excessive and insufficient GWG were 37 and 34%, respectively. The median GWG was 13 kg; adolescents with restrictive behaviors had higher GWG (13 vs. 12 kg, p = 0.023). After adjusting for pregestational body mass index and other covariables, the restrictive (β = 0.67, p = 0.039), compensatory (β = 0.65, p = 0.044), and binge–purge behaviors (β = 0.54, p = 0.013) were associated with higher GWG.

A semi-structured interview was applied to 114 production units, chosen by stratified random sampling. The interview included technological, production and socioeconomic aspects. Twenty-eight variables were initially explored and 12 were used for multivariate analysis, which included Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and K-means Cluster. The characterisation carried out showed that the production units that predominate in northeastern Michoacán have survived with a low technological level, having as strengths the diversification of their activities and the use of family labour. On the contrary, production units with a high technological level and high productivity are few and less diversified. This shows the need to generate differentiated public policies for each cluster, aimed at strengthening the aspects that have allowed them to survive and guaranteeing a market for their production, before promoting the use of technologies.;Family labour | Holstein model | Multivariate analysis | Small-scale dairy systems;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of chronic stress on the viability, integrity, and maturation of rat oocytes depending on estrous cycle phases, specifically proestrus, estrus, and diestrus. Methods: For this purpose, adult female rats were stressed daily by cold water immersion (15◦C) for 30 consecutive days. Results: In chronically stressed female rats, irregular estrous cyclicity, increased corticosterone levels, decreased oocyte viability, and an increased percentage of abnormal oocytes were obtained in all the estrous cycle phases, resulting in reduced oocyte maturation during proestrus.

In-gel-gelatin zymography for MMP-9 activation was performed. Adrenergic receptors (α2AR and β3AR), myosins (Myc6 and Myc7), Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA expression were quantified by qRT-PCR. Fetal hypertrophy of the left ventricular lateral wall (LVLW) in rat pups with DG persists until day 8, although this process appears to be reversed during the postnatal stage. The temporal continuity of the study demonstrated a thinning of the ventricular wall, similar to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This ventricular remodeling process is associated with the expression of β3 adrenergic receptors and miR-21, -23b. The Bax/Bcl2 ratio was significantly reduced only at early ages. In addition, the increase in interstitial space in all ages, as well as the predominance of early ages expression of Col2 and increased expression of Col3, MMP-9 and Cx43 in late ages, is the result of an active extracellular remodeling in the hearts of rat pups with GD.;adrenergic receptors | dilated cardiomyopathy | gestational diabetes | hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | microRNAs | type 2 diabetes;0;0;;;;HIM/2016/036 SSA1272;

The study aims to: (i) model the change in the LBW risk at the municipality level in Greater Mexico City, identifying municipalities with highest and lowest LBW risk; and (ii) explore the role of some socioeconomic and demographic risk factors in explaining LBW variations. We propose a Bayesian spatio-temporal analysis to control for space-time patterning of the data and for maternal age and prenatal care, both found to be important LBW determinants. Most of the high-risk municipalities are in the south-west and west of Greater Mexico City; and although for many of these municipalities the trend is stable, some present an increasing LBW risk over time. The results also identify those with medium-risk and with an increasing trend. These findings can support decision-makers in geographical targeting efforts to address spatial health inequalities, they may also facilitate a more proactive and cost-efficient approach to reduce LBW risk.";Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling | Child health | Space-time variation | Spatial random effects | Term low birth weight;0;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Contrary to personality traits, implicit motives are often deemed to be rather stable personality characteristics. Normally, implicit motives are obtained by Operant Motives, unconscious intrinsic desires measured by the Operant Motive Test (OMT). The OMT test requires participants to write freely descriptions associated with a set of provided images and questions. In this work, we explore different recent machine learning techniques and various text representation techniques for facing the problem of the OMT classification task. We focused on advanced language representations (e.g, BERT, XLM, and DistilBERT) and deep Supervised Autoencoders for solving the OMT task. We performed an exhaustive analysis and compared their performance against fully connected neural networks and traditional support vector classifiers. Our comparative study highlights the importance of BERT which outperforms the traditional machine learning techniques by a relative improvement of 7.9%. In addition, we performed an analysis of how the BERT attention mechanism is being modified. Our findings indicate that the writing style features acquire higher importance at the moment of accurately identifying the different OMT categories. This is the first time that a study to determine the performance of different transformer-based architectures in the OMT task is performed. Similarly, our work propose, for the first time, using deep supervised autoencoders in the OMT classification task. Our experiments demonstrate that transformer-based methods exhibit the best empirical results, obtaining a relative improvement of 7.9% over the competitive baseline suggested as part of the GermEval 2020 challenge. Additionally, we show that features associated with the writing style are more important than content-based words. Some of these findings show strong connections to previously reported behavioral research on the implicit psychometrics theory.;BERT | Deep learning | Natural language processing | Operant motive test | Psycholinguistics | Supervised autoencoder;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;SNI;165545;Sistema Nacional de Investigadores

Prolonged ischemia can cause mucosal integrity to lose its barrier function, triggering alterations that can induce organ dysfunction and lead to death. Electrical impedance spectroscopy has been proposed to identify early alteration in ischemia-induced gastric mucosa in this type of patients. This work analyzed changes in impedance parameters, and tissue and molecular alterations that allow us to identify the time of ischemia in which the gastric mucosa still maintains its barrier function. The animals were randomly distributed in four groups: Control, Ischemia 60, 90, and 120 min. Impedance parameters were measured and predictive values were determined to categorize the degree of injury using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Markers of inflammatory process and apoptosis (iNOS, TNFα, COX-2, and Caspase-3) were analyzed. The largest increase in impedance parameters occurred in the ischemia 90 and 120 min groups, with resistance at low frequencies (RL) and reactance at high frequencies (XH) being the most related to damage, allowing prediction of the occurrence of reversible and irreversible tissue damage. Histological analysis and apoptosis assay showed progressive mucosal deterioration with irreversible damage (p < 0.001) starting from 90 min of ischemia. Furthermore, a significant increase in the expression of iNOS, TNFα, and COX-2 was identified in addition to apoptosis in the gastric mucosa starting from 90 min of ischemia. Tissue damage generated by an ischemia time greater than 60 min induces loss of barrier function in the gastric mucosa.;bioimpedance | biomarkers | digital pathology | electrical impedance spectroscopy | gastric impedance parameters | Gastric ischemia;1;0;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Five products were prepared and analyzed during 28 days of shelf-life: control without treatment (C0), beverage submitted to heat treatment for 10 min (HP10), and beverages submitted to ultrasound treatment for 10 (US10), 20 (US20), and 40 (US40) min, with these times being defined based on a previously conducted pilot study. The US40 beverage presented the highest levels of oligosaccharides (31.99%), organic (48.93%) and ascorbic (26.09%) acids, and minerals (83.59%) compared to those found for HP10. The US40 also showed better antioxidant activity and 81.80% more phenolic compounds when compared with the HP10. The US40 presented greater stability for bioactive compounds and showed fewer changes in the color parameters, lower microorganism count, and greater acceptability regarding quality during shelf-life, while the HP10 sample presented the worst results. Therefore, the US40 beverage has higher functional potential, and ultrasound represents a promising technique to preserve or improve the quality of this product during its processing and shelf-life.;Bioactive compounds | Cactus | Functional food | Shelf-life | Ultrasound;9;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;CAPES;CAPES/PROEX 1734/2015;Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

It has been reported that some ameloblastomas could arise from dentigerous cyst walls; thus, the development of ameloblastoma from dentigerous cysts may be due to differential protein expression. Our aim was to identify a membrane protein that is differentially expressed in ameloblastomas with respect to dentigerous cysts. Methods: We analyzed the SDS-PAGE profiles of membrane proteins from ameloblastomas and dentigerous cysts. The protein in a band present in the ameloblastoma sample, but apparently absent in the dentigerous cyst sample was identified via mass spectrometry as the chaperonin Hsp60. We used western blotting and immunohistochemistry to analyze its overexpression and localization in ameloblastoma. Results: We found a differential band of 95 kDa in the membrane proteins of ameloblastoma. In this band, the chaperonin Hsp60 was identified, and its overexpression was corroborated using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Hsp60 was localized in the plasma membrane of all ameloblastoma samples studied; in addition, it was found in the cell nucleus of the plexiform subtype of conventional ameloblastoma. Conclusions: Our results suggest that Hsp60 may be involved in ameloblastoma development, and could therefore be a potential therapeutic target for ameloblastoma treatment.";Dentigerous cyst | Differential expression | Hsp60 | Membrane proteins | Odontogenic tumors;0;0;;;CONACYT;230110;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The overall prevalence of the parasite in cattle between January and December of 2017 was 20.6% (1407 out of 6834); the highest rate of condemnation was observed in Veracruz (26.3%; tropical climate), and the lowest rate was found in Puebla (15.5%; temperate climate). The seasonal prevalence of fluke infection was 18.6%, 14.8% and 28.4% during the wet season, and 17.1%, 12.4% and 22.8% during the dry season in the three abattoir sites, located in the districts of Zacatlán, Teziutlán and Ciudad Alemán, respectively. Liver condemnations due to bovine fasciolosis were prevalent in the Zacatlán, Teziutlán and Ciudad Alemán districts during summer, autumn and summer, respectively.

A linear regression analysis of NICS and antifungal activity showed that both tested variables were significantly related (p < 0.05); when aromaticity increased, the antifungal activity decreased for series I and increased for series II. To verify the validity of the obtained equations, a new set of 44 benzofuran-4-ones was designed by replacing the nitrogen atom of the five-membered ring with oxygen in indol-4-ones. The NICS(0) and NICS(1) of benzofuran-4-ones were calculated and used to predict their biological activities using the previous equations. A set of 10 benzofuran-4-ones was synthesized and tested in eight human pathogenic fungi, showing the validity of the equations.

The dams produced 225 liveborn puppies and 47 were classified as stillbirth type II. Blood samples were taken from the umbilical vein to evaluate the concentration of gases, glucose, lactate, calcium, hematocrit levels, and blood pH. The liveborn puppies in C2, C3, and C4 had more evident physiological alterations (hypercapnia, acidosis) than those in C1 (p < 0.05). These signs indicate a process of transitory asphyxiation. The stillborn pups in all four categories had higher weights than their liveborn littermates. C3 and C4 had the highest mean weights (419.86 and 433.79 g, respectively) and mortality rates (C3 = 20.58%, C4 = 24.58%).

The operating principle of IRT is detecting the heat irradiated in anatomical regions characterized by a high density of near-surface blood vessels that can regulate temperature gain or loss from/to the environment by modifying blood flow. This is essential for understanding the various vascular thermoregulation mechanisms of different species, such as rodents and ruminants’ tails. The usefulness of ocular, nasal, and vulvar thermal windows in the orbital (regio orbitalis), nasal (regio nasalis), and urogenital (regio urogenitalis) regions, respectively, has been demonstrated in cattle. However, recent evidence for the river buffalo has detected discrepancies in the data gathered from distinct thermal regions in these large ruminants, suggesting a limited sensitivity and specificity when used with this species due to various factors: the presence of hair, ambient temperature, and anatomical features, such as skin thickness and variations in blood supplies to different regions. In this review, a literature search was conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and PubMed, using keyword combinations that included “infrared thermography”, “water buffalo”, “river buffalo” “thermoregulation”, “microvascular changes”, “lacrimal caruncle”, “udder”, “mastitis”, and “nostril”. We discuss recent findings on four thermal windows—the orbital and nasal regions, mammary gland in the udder region (regio uberis), and vulvar in the urogenital region (regio urogenitalis)—to elucidate the factors that modulate and intervene in validating thermal windows and interpreting the information they provide, as it relates to the clinical usefulness of IRT for cattle (Bos) and the river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).;Animal welfare | Bubalus bubalis | Cows | Infrared thermography | River buffalo | Thermal window;30;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In contrast, fever is a controlled state, since the body adjusts its stable temperature range to increase body temperature without losing the thermoregu-lation capacity. Fever refers to an acute phase response that confers a survival benefit on the body, raising core body temperature during infection or systemic inflammation processes to reduce the survival and proliferation of infectious pathogens by altering temperature, restriction of essential nutrients, and the activation of an immune reaction. However, once the infection resolves, the febrile response must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive tissue damage. During fever, neurolog-ical, endocrine, immunological, and metabolic changes occur that cause an increase in the stable temperature range, which allows the core body temperature to be considerably increased to stop the invasion of the offending agent and restrict the damage to the organism. There are different metabolic mechanisms of thermoregulation in the febrile response at the central and peripheral levels and cellular events. In response to cold or heat, the brain triggers thermoregulatory responses to coping with changes in body temperature, including autonomic effectors, such as thermogenesis, vasodilation, sweating, and behavioral mechanisms, that trigger flexible, goal-oriented actions, such as seeking heat or cold, nest building, and postural extension. Infrared thermography (IRT) has proven to be a reliable method for the early detection of pathologies affecting animal health and welfare that represent economic losses for farmers. However, the standardization of protocols for IRT use is still needed. Together with the complete understanding of the physiological and behavioral responses involved in the febrile process, it is possible to have timely solutions to serious prob-lem situations. For this reason, the present review aims to analyze the new findings in pathophysiological mechanisms of the febrile process, the heat-loss mechanisms in an animal with fever, ther-moregulation, the adverse effects of fever, and recent scientific findings related to different pathol-ogies in farm animals through the use of IRT.";Animal welfare | Febrile response | Hyperthermia | Infectious process | Pathogen | Pyrogen | Thermogenesis | Thermolysis | Thermoregulation | Thermoregulatory behavior;18;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Here we present a geospatial analysis of EBF prevalence estimates from 2000 to 2018 across 94 LMICs mapped to policy-relevant administrative units (for example, districts), quantify subnational inequalities and their changes over time, and estimate probabilities of meeting the World Health Organization’s Global Nutrition Target (WHO GNT) of ≥70% EBF prevalence by 2030. While six LMICs are projected to meet the WHO GNT of ≥70% EBF prevalence at a national scale, only three are predicted to meet the target in all their district-level units by 2030.;;10;1;repositoryam;Green;BMGF;PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0084;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

On the other hand, lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17) is a little and basic protein. The objective of this work was to test the functionality of the strategy of Rational Design of Immobilized Derivatives for the immobilization by electrostatic adsorption of egg white lysozyme on SP-Sepharose FastFlow support. The RDID1.0 software was used to predict the superficial lysozyme clusters, the electrostatic configuration probability for each cluster, and the theoretical and estimated maximum quantity of protein to be immobilized. In addition, immobilization was performed and the experimental parameter practical maximum quantity of protein to be immobilized and the enzymatic activity of the immobilized derivative were assessed. The estimated maximum quantity of protein to be immobilized (9.49 protein mg/support g) was close to the experimental practical maximum quantity of protein to be immobilized (14.73 ± 0.09 protein mg/support g). The enzymatic activity assay with the chitosan substrate showed the catalytic functionality of the lysozyme-SP-Sepharose immobilized derivative (35.85 ± 3.07 U/support g), which preserved 78% functional activity. The used algorithm to calculate the estimated maximum quantity of protein to be immobilized works for other proteins, porous solid supports and immobilization methods, and this parameter has a high predictive value, useful for obtaining optimum immobilized derivatives. The applied methodology is valid to predict the most probable protein-support configurations and their catalytic competences, which concur with the experimental results. The produced biocatalyst had a high retention of functional activity. This indicates its functionality in enzymatic bioconversion processes.;Experimental validation | Immobilization by electrostatic adsorption | Maximum quantity of protein to be immobilized | Modeling of algorithms | Most probable configuration | Protein loading study;1;0;;;;undefined;

The presence of lipid droplets in odontogenic tissues and/or tumors is unknown. Methods: Immunohistochemistry for perilipin 1 and adipophilin was performed in 12 human tooth germs (TG), 27 conventional ameloblastoma (AM), and 8 ameloblastic carcinoma (AC) samples. Cytoplasmic staining was analyzed using an immunoreactive score (IRS), and the results were compared for the TG, AM, and AC samples by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's post-test and confirmed by Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Perilipin 1 was negative in 91.7% of the TG samples, positive in 48.2% of the AM samples, and positive in 87.5% of the AC samples. Adipophilin was positive in 100% of the TG samples, 92.6% of the AM samples, and 100% of the AC samples. The perilipin 1 and adipophilin IRS revealed statistically significant differences between the TG, AM, and AC samples (p =.007 and p =.018, respectively). The perilipin 1 levels among the TG and AC samples were statically significant (**p =.0085), as well as the adipophilin levels when TG and AM samples were compared (**p <.0029). Conclusions: Adipophilin exhibits significant activity in human tooth development. The immunoexpression of perilipin 1 and adipophilin in the AM and AC samples suggests the presence of lipid droplets, providing further evidence of metabolic alterations in these tumors. Additional studies with larger samples and alternative techniques are necessary to confirm these findings.;adipophilin | ameloblastic carcinoma | ameloblastoma | lipid droplets | perilipin;3;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The Dominican Foundation for Marine Studies (FUNDEMAR) has become a pioneer of these efforts in the Dominican Republic, being the first institution to successfully implement coral sexual reproduction techniques in the country and establishing the first mobile larvae culturing facility. Here we share our perspective on three main components behind the success of FUNDEMAR’s program: (1) a self-sustainable program in alliance with local and international organizations, (2) the design and construction of the first Coral Assisted Reproduction Laboratory in the country, and a (3) clearly defined scalable structure for outcome performance. Two years after program implementation, FUNDEMAR has successfully produced an annual regional coral spawning prediction calendar, cultured seven coral species, and seeded over 4,500 substrates with more than 268,200 sexual coral recruits in approximately 1,880 m2 reef areas. Here, we provide a detailed description of a fully functional assisted coral reproduction program, including the lessons learned during its implementation as well as a series of specific solutions. We hope this work will help and inspire other countries and small institutions to replicate FUNDEMAR’s coral assisted reproduction program components and contribute to the expansion of sexual coral restoration efforts in the Caribbean.;coral rearing | coral reefs | coral restoration | Dominican Republic | science-based solutions | sexual propagation;2;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;USAID;468.40 EKF AA46187491;United States Agency for International Development

Most infectious diseases are spatially limited by the presence of the transmitter, whose abundance and survival are influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of food sources. A tool that facilitates its study is the use of Geographic Information Systems. The objective of this study was to analyze the interaction of populations of hematophagous bats and humans, through the development of a probable model of dispersal of D. rotundus based on known shelters and different environmental variables, in addition to analyzing the relationship between shelters identified for three years and their proximity to human settlements, as a process of coexistence. The study was conducted in the state of San Luis Potosí from 2014 to 2016. A total of 180 shelters of D. rotundus distributed towards the Huasteca region were identified, 80 % of these were built by man and 57 % were inhabited. A buffer of 5 km around from the location of each shelter was calculated, finding inside a total of 976 rural communities and 15 cities, with 337,836 inhabitants. The average distance from shelters to the first human settlement was 518.65 ± 11.33 m. It is necessary to continue studying the association between urbanization and the emergence of zoonoses, through the understanding of the interactions between wild animals-livestock-humans.;Coexistence | GIS | Human population | Vampire bat | Zoonoses;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The objective of this study was to provide information on the presence of total aflatoxins in spices, ingredients and spice mixtures used for the formulation of meat products and meat products marketed in Mexico City, using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Fifty samples were analyzed for total aflatoxins. Sixty-one percent of spices and ingredients were positive for total aflatoxins in concentrations of 0.07 to 4.24 μg/kg; 75 % of spice mixtures were positive, in quantities of 0.6 to 1.9 μg/kg and only 3.5 % of meat products were positive for total aflatoxins. The samples with the highest prevalence of total aflatoxins were chili and paprika. All results showed concentrations below the maximum limit set by the European Union of 10 to 20 μg/kg for total aflatoxins, which does not constitute a current public health problem under the conditions analyzed. It is recommended to use the ELISA system as a screening method and subsequent confirmation by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, as well as to have a monitoring program to evaluate the presence of aflatoxins and other mycotoxins; there is also a need for an official Mexican regulation for mycotoxins in spices considering the high consumption of chili in the Mexican population.";Aflatoxins | ELISA | Meat products | Spices;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Although there are drugs for its therapy, sometimes they are ineffective and promote adverse effects that lead to the abandonment of treatment by the patient.3,4 Species of the annonaceae family are used in traditional Mexican medicine for their anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, anticancer, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, however, the therapeutic properties of the species of Annona reticulata (A. reticulata)5,6 are not known. The objective of this study consisted in making a discernment of the possible anticonvulsant and antidepressant effects in experimental models in rats. Method: the dried leaves of A. reticulata prepared as an ethanolic extract were used to evaluate its effects as an anticonvulsant in the pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure test and as an antidepressant in the forced swim test. In Wistar rats, sodium valproate and imipramine were used as reference drugs, respectively. Results: A. reticulata increased latency and decreased the severity of seizures and reduced depressive behavior. Conclusion: this study provides preclinical evidence of the anticonvulsant and antidepressant properties of A. reticulata leaves, reinforcing its potential in the search for therapeutic alternatives for CNS disorders.;Annona reticulata | Depression | Epilepsy | Forced swimming test | Pentilentetrazole;0;1;;;;undefined;

It is important that mother and young establish a bond based on a learning mechanism defined as “imprinting” early after parturition during the sensitive period, on which the welfare and survival of the offspring will depend. This review aims to summarize and discuss current knowledge regarding the imprinting process, the neurobiological pathways that are triggered during this sensitive period, and the development of the cow–calf bond. Touch, hearing, vision, and smell seem to be the predominant senses involved during imprinting in buffaloes and other mammalian farm species. In buffalo, bonding is very particular due to the expression of specific behaviors, such as allo-suckling and communal rearing. In general, imprinting and the subsequent bond may be affected by the lack of experience of the mothers or dystocic parturitions, which occur most frequently with male calves and in primiparous dams. The main problems in the development of this process include lack of seeking a protected and isolated place to give birth; moving from the birth-site after parturition; insufficient postpartum care; aversion or aggressiveness towards the newborn, or abandonment of the newborn. The process can develop differently according to the species. However, the correct development of the cow–calf relationship represents, regardless of the species, a key factor for their fitness.";Animal welfare | Bonding | Buffaloes | Imprinting | Mother–young relationship;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The plasmid contains a copy of the positive replication control molecule rnaII under the control of the Pvgb promoter. The plasmid was unstable in the engineered strain. Sequencing showed that the plasmid was fragmented during preculture development, probably due to interactions between the host and vector genetic elements. Therefore, the rnaII copy under the control of the microaerobic promoters Pvgb, Pyfid, or Pyfidm was inserted in the minimal plasmid pUC57mini. Such plasmids were successfully produced in the engineered strain. The maximum plasmid DNA yield from biomass was 16.6 ± 0.1 mg g−1 in microaerobic cultures of the engineered strain using the Pyifd promoter. This was 14-fold greater than that using the original pUC57mini and the wild-type strain.

Similar operation conditions (continuous aeration and mild intermittent mixing) and two dimensionless numbers with similar L/D ratio and a similar working volume were applied to reach a scale-up factor of 75. An innovative bioreactor with rotating helical ribbons (15 kg wet matter) was used at pilot scale. A mathematical model was proposed and validated to evaluate the respirometry trends at laboratory and pilot scale exhibiting similar behavior. The cell viability was (1.3 ± 0.4) × 109 and (1.3 ± 0.3) × 109 colony-forming units per gram of initial dry mass at laboratory and pilot scale, at 36 and 43 h, respectively. A. brasilense maintains its viability twelve months of storage at 4 and 30 °C. This is the first report of A. brasilense being cultivated in SSC under controlled conditions. SSC processes involving unicellular microorganisms with tolerance to agitation are a promising technology to produce biofertilizers.

The Androgen Receptor gene is important in this pathology due to its participation, mainly, in the inguinoscrotal phase of testicular descent. We determine the length of the CAG tract in the Androgen Receptor (AR) gene in Mexican patients with nonsyndromic cryptorchidism. One hundred and 15 males were included; of these, 62 had nonsyndromic cryptorchidism and 53 were healthy volunteers. DNA was extracted from a peripheral blood samples, subsequently, the CAG tract in exon 1 of AR gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Mexican patients with nonsyndromic cryptorchidism presented 25.03 ± 2.58 repeats of CAG tract in the AR gene compared to 22.72 ± 3.17 repeats of CAG tract in Mexican healthy individuals (p≤0.0001; t value of 4.3). Furthermore, the deletion of codon 57 that corresponds to the deletion of a leucine residue at position 57 (Del L57) in the AR gene was found for the first time in a nonsyndromic cryptorchidism patient. This molecular alteration has been related previously to testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT). The CAG tract in the AR gene is longer in patients with nonsyndromic cryptorchidism than in healthy individuals, supporting the association between this polymorphism of the AR gene and nonsyndromic cryptorchidism in the Mexican population.";Androgen Receptor | CAG repeat polymorphism | Mexican patients | nonsyndromic cryptorchidism | PolyQ;1;0;;;;undefined;

Facilitation or modulation of functional recovery is an important goal of rehabilitation in all patients who survive severe TBI. However, this recovery tends to vary among patients because it is affected by the biological and physical characteristics of the patients; the types, doses, and application regimens of the drugs used; and clinical indications. In clinical practice, diverse dopaminergic drugs with various dosing and application procedures are used for TBI. Previous studies have shown that dopamine (DA) neurotransmission is disrupted following moderate to severe TBI and have reported beneficial effects of drugs that affect the dopaminergic system. However, the mechanisms of action of dopaminergic drugs have not been completely clarified, partly because dopaminergic receptor activation can lead to restoration of the pathway of the corticobasal ganglia after injury in brain structures with high densities of these receptors.

To date, most genetic studies of glycemic traits have focused on individuals of European ancestry. Here we aggregated genome-wide association studies comprising up to 281,416 individuals without diabetes (30% non-European ancestry) for whom fasting glucose, 2-h glucose after an oral glucose challenge, glycated hemoglobin and fasting insulin data were available. Trans-ancestry and single-ancestry meta-analyses identified 242 loci (99 novel; P < 5 × 10−8), 80% of which had no significant evidence of between-ancestry heterogeneity. Analyses restricted to individuals of European ancestry with equivalent sample size would have led to 24 fewer new loci. Compared with single-ancestry analyses, equivalent-sized trans-ancestry fine-mapping reduced the number of estimated variants in 99% credible sets by a median of 37.5%. Genomic-feature, gene-expression and gene-set analyses revealed distinct biological signatures for each trait, highlighting different underlying biological pathways. Our results increase our understanding of diabetes pathophysiology by using trans-ancestry studies for improved power and resolution.";;83;0;repositoryam;Green;TPC;undefined;Eli Lilly and Company

Up to 3,828 individuals (70% gastropods and 30% bivalves), belonging to 209 species (146 gastropods and 63 bivalves), were identified; this is one of the most diverse molluscan faunas (2.77 species/m2) associated with reef systems in the MTP. Evaluation of the sampling effort demonstrated that 80% of gastropod species and 93% of bivalve species inhabiting the reef system were recovered. The highest abundance occurred in the coral substrate (1,939 individuals), while the highest species richness was found on the rock substrate (131 species). The analysis showed that the greatest spatial variation in total mollusc, gastropod and bivalve diversity occurred among different substrates within individual localities, with minor differences among assemblages with increasing spatial scale reflecting the relative homogeneity of the molluscan fauna in the study area. While the gastropods Conus nux, Steironepion piperatum and Muricopsis zeteki accounted for differences among different regions, and Vermicularia pellucida eburnea and Bostrycapulus aculeatus accounted for differences among states, the abundances of M. zeteki, B. aculeatus and V. pellucida eburnea were related to differences in diversity at the scale of individual localities. Among bivalves, Leiosolenus aristatus, L. plumula and Gastrochaena ovata accounted for differences between regions, states and localities, respectively. Overall, the study shows that species composition is influenced by both the substrate and the geographical location of assemblages. This indicates that conservation strategies should address preserving habitat heterogeneity at local scales in the study area.";;2;0;;;;undefined;

The study of the hypothalamic neuromodulation of thermoregulation offers broad areas of opportunity with practical applications that are currently being strengthened by the availability of efficacious tools like infrared thermography (IRT). These areas could include the following: understanding the effect of climate change on behavior and productivity; analyzing the effects of exercise on animals involved in sporting activities; identifying the microvascular changes that occur in response to fear, pleasure, pain, and other situations that induce stress in animals; and examining thermoregulating behaviors. This research could contribute substantially to understanding the drastic modification of environments that have severe consequences for animals, such as loss of appetite, low productivity, neonatal hypothermia, and thermal shock, among others. Current knowledge of these physiological processes and complex anatomical structures, like the nervous systems and their close relation to mechanisms of thermoregulation, is still limited. The results of studies in fields like evolutionary neuroscience of thermoregulation show that we cannot yet objectively explain even processes that on the surface seem simple, including behavioral changes and the pathways and connections that trigger mechanisms like vasodilatation and panting. In addition, there is a need to clarify the connection between emotions and thermoregulation that increases the chances of survival of some organisms. An increasingly precise understanding of thermoregulation will allow us to design and apply practical methods in fields like animal science and clinical medicine without compromising levels of animal welfare. The results obtained should not only increase the chances of survival but also improve quality of life and animal production.";Cutaneous circu-lation | Temperature modulation | Thermal biology | Thermoregulating behaviors | Vascular microcirculation;29;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

progress of prevention and control efforts and assist with improving the precision and efficiency of targeting efforts. We aimed to assess HIV incidence and HIV mortality for all second-level administrative units across sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: In this modelling study, we developed a framework that used the geographically specific HIV prevalence data collected in seroprevalence surveys and antenatal care clinics to train a model that estimates HIV incidence and mortality among individuals aged 15–49 years. We used a model-based geostatistical framework to estimate HIV prevalence at the second administrative level in 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for 2000–18 and sought data on the number of individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) by second-level administrative unit. We then modified the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) to use these HIV prevalence and treatment estimates to estimate HIV incidence and mortality by second-level administrative unit. Findings: The estimates suggest substantial variation in HIV incidence and mortality rates both between and within countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with 15 countries having a ten-times or greater difference in estimated HIV incidence between the second-level administrative units with the lowest and highest estimated incidence levels. Across all 44 countries in 2018, HIV incidence ranged from 2·8 (95% uncertainty interval 2·1–3·8) in Mauritania to 1585·9 (1369·4–1824·8) cases per 100 000 people in Lesotho and HIV mortality ranged from 0·8 (0·7–0·9) in Mauritania to 676·5 (513·6–888·0) deaths per 100 000 people in Lesotho. Variation in both incidence and mortality was substantially greater at the subnational level than at the national level and the highest estimated rates were accordingly higher. Among second-level administrative units, Guijá District, Gaza Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV incidence (4661·7 [2544·8–8120·3]) cases per 100 000 people in 2018 and Inhassunge District, Zambezia Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV mortality rate (1163·0 [679·0–1866·8]) deaths per 100 000 people. Further, the rate of reduction in HIV incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2018, as well as the ratio of new infections to the number of people living with HIV was highly variable. Although most second-level administrative units had declines in the number of new cases (3316 [81·1%] of 4087 units) and number of deaths (3325 [81·4%]), nearly all appeared well short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths between 2010 and 2020. Interpretation: Our estimates suggest that most second-level administrative units in sub-Saharan Africa are falling short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths by 2020, which is further compounded by substantial within-country variability. These estimates will help decision makers and programme implementers expand access to ART and better target health resources to higher burden subnational areas.

DFAs have been considered beneficial for health, particularly polyunsaturated (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) exert their function on DFA metabolism by modulating gene expression, and have drawn great attention for their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review explicitly examined the effects of DFAs on miRNA expression associated with metabolic diseases, such as obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as inflammation, published in the last ten years. DFAs have been shown to induce and repress miRNA expression associated with metabolic disease and inflammation in different cell types and organisms, both in vivo and in vitro, depending on varying combinations of DFAs, doses, and the duration of treatment. However, studies are limited and heterogeneous in methodology. Additionally, recent studies demonstrated that high fat ketogenic diets, many enriched with saturated fats, do not increase serum saturated fat content in humans, and are not associated with increased inflammation. Thus, these findings shed light on the complexity of novel treatment and DFA interventions for metabolic disease and to maintain health. Further studies are needed to advance molecular therapeutic approaches, including miRNA-based strategies in human health and disease.;Cardiovascular disease | Dietary fatty acids | Inflammation | Metabolic disorders | MiRNA expression | Monounsaturated fatty acids | Polyunsaturated fatty acids;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;INPer;5895;Instituto Nacional de Perinatología

Therefore, intake of micronutrient supplements could be a therapeutic alternative. Since the copper distribution profile has not been elucidated yet, the aim of this study was to characterize and to analyze the concentration profile of a single administration of copper gluconate to rats by two routes of administration. Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups. The control group received vehicle (n = 5), and the experimental groups received 79.5 mg/kg of copper orally (n = 4–6) or 0.64 mg/kg of copper intravenously. (n = 3–4). Blood, striatum, midbrain and liver samples were collected at different times. Copper concentrations were assessed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Copper concentration in samples from the control group were considered as baseline. The highest copper concentration in plasma was observed at 1.5 h after oral administration, while copper was quickly compartmentalized within the first hour after intravenous administration. The striatum evidenced a maximum metal concentration at 0.25 h for both routes of administration, however, the midbrain did not show any change. The highest concentration of the metal was held by the liver. The use of copper salts as replacement therapy should consider its rapid and discrete accumulation into the brain and the rapid and massive distribution of the metal into the liver for both oral and intravenous routes. Development of controlled-release pharmaceutical formulations may overcome the problems that the liver accumulation may imply, particularly, for hepatic copper toxicity.

Specimens were then re-tested. Different loading protocols were used on each specimen to assess their impact on the load-deformation capacity. Such protocols were displacement-controlled and applied quasi-statically. Performance of the specimens, before and after rehabilitation, is presented and discussed in terms of strength and drift capacity, energy dissipation, equivalent viscous damping, effective stiffness, cracking, and visual damage.

The establishment of a plant community over the tailings has been proposed as a containment strategy known as phytostabilization. Previously, we described naturally occurring mine tailing colonizing plants such as Acacia farnesiana, Brickellia coulteri, Baccharis sarothroides, and Gnaphalium leucocephalum without finding local adaptation. We explored the rhizosphere microbes as contributors in plant establishment and described both the culturable and in situ diversity of rhizospheric bacteria using the 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun sequencing. We built a synthetic community (SC) of culturable rhizosphere bacteria from the mine tailings. The SC was then the foundation for a serial passes experiment grown in plant-derived nutrient sources, selecting for heavy metals tolerance, community cooperation, and competition. The outcome of the serial passes was named the ‘final synthetic community’ (FSC). Overall, diversity decreased from in situ uncultivable microbes from roots (399 bacteria genera) to the cultivated communities (291 genera), the SC (94 genera), and the lowest diversity was in the FSC (43 genera). Metagenomic diversity clustered into 94,245 protein families, where we found plant growth promotion-related genes such as the csgBAC and entCEBAH, coded in a metagenome-assembled genome named Kosakonia sp. Nacozari. Finally, we used the FSC to inoculate mine tailing colonizing plants in a greenhouse experiment. The plants with the FSC inocula observed higher relative plant growth rates in sterile substrates. The FSC presents promising features that might make it useful for phytostabilization tailored strategies.;Mesocosm | Metagenomics | Microbiome | Mine tailing | Phytostabilization | Rhizosphere;6;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;237387;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This hypoxic microenvironment modulates the expression of genes linked to a more aggressive disease. However, it is unclear if the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes as cytochromes P450 (CYPs) is affected by hypoxia in cancer. We aimed to define which cytochromes are affected by hypoxia using a liver cancer model in vitro. For this purpose, we assessed whole-genome expression microarrays of HepG2 liver cancer cell line from free repository databases, looking for gene expression hypoxia-associated profiles and selected those cytochromes with significant differences. Then, we corroborated their mRNA expression and protein levels by RT-qPCR and western blot, respectively, as well as immunofluorescence. Based on microarray analysis, we found that the expression of CYP2S1 and CYP24A1 were up-regulated with at least twice fold change compared with normoxia. The levels of mRNA and protein of CYP2S1 and CYP24A1 were increased significantly in hypoxic conditions (P <.05), and this tendency was also observed by immunofluorescence assays. Our data show that the expression of cytochromes CYP2S1 and CYP24A1 are induced in hypoxia, being the first time that CYP24A1 expression is associated with tumour hypoxia; which might have consequences in cancer progression and drug resistance. Significance of the study: Hypoxia is among the most important factors for cellular adaptation to stress. Especially in cancer, a major public health issue, hypoxia plays a substantial role in angiogenesis, metastasis and resistance to therapy. Tumoral hypoxia has been described at least in the brain, breast, cervical, liver, renal, lung, pancreatic and renal cancer. However, the understanding of how hypoxia drives cancer progression is still a major challenge. One emerging question is the role of hypoxia over the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes, with a significant impact on drug treatment. In this context, our paper focus on the effect of hypoxia on CYPs, which is an essential group of drug-metabolizing enzymes. We show that hypoxia induces the expression of two members of the CYPs family: CYP2S1 and CYP24A1. Importantly, CYP2S1 is a major metabolizer of carcinogenic substances being relevant that hypoxia could promote this function. Interestingly, CYP24A1 limits the action of the active form of vitamin D, which is an anti-proliferative factor in cancer. Our evidence shows for the first time that hypoxia can induce CYP24A1 expression, with a potential effect on cancer progression. Our contribution clarifies a particular effect of tumoral hypoxia and the implications will be useful in the understanding of the progression of cancer, the resistance to treatment and the development of alternative therapies.";CYP24A1 | CYP2S1 | cytochrome P450 | hypoxia | liver cancer;10;0;;;CONACYT;024/2017;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Thermal technologies such as multi‐effect distillation and multi‐stage flash distillation still comprise an important portion of the world’s desalination capacity. They consume substantial amounts of energy, generally obtained from fossil fuels, due to their low efficiency. Hybridization is a strategy that seeks to reduce the weaknesses and enhance the advantages of each element that makes it up. This paper introduces a review of the most recent publications on hybridizations between reverse osmosis and thermal desalination technologies, as well as their integration with renewable energies as a requirement to decarbonize desalination processes.

Its levels decrease in patients and animal models of epilepsy. Thus, changes in SV2A expression could be a critical factor in the response to LEV. Epilepsy is characterized by an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, hence SV2A levels in particular terminals could also influence the LEV response. SV2A expression was analyzed in the epileptic hippocampus of rats which responded or not to LEV, to clarify if changes in SV2A alone or together with glutamatergic or GABAergic markers may predict LEV resistance. Wistar rats were administered saline (control) or pilocarpine to induce epilepsy. These groups were subdivided into untreated or LEV-treated groups. All epileptic rats were video-monitored to assess their number of seizures. Epileptic rats with an important seizure reduction (>50%) were classified as responders. SV2A, vesicular γ-aminobutyric acid transporter and vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) expression were assessed by immunostaining. SV2A expression was not modified during epilepsy. However, responders showed ≈55% SV2A-VGLUT co-expression in comparison with the non-responder group (≈40%). Thus, SV2A expression in glutamatergic terminals may be important for the response to LEV treatment.;Hippocampus | Levetiracetam | Pharmacoresistance | SV2A | Temporal lobe epilepsy | VGAT | VGLUT;5;1;repositoryvor;Green;INP;INP-064-2015;Instituto Nacional de Pediatria

This effect has been found when treatments that disrupt neuronal activity are administered to different regions of the brain, including the amygdala. However, the molecular mechanisms induced by this intense training are unknown. We made a detailed mapping of c-Fos-expressing neurons in four regions of the amygdala after moderate and intense one-trial inhibitory avoidance training. Rats were sacrificed 90 min after training or after appropriate control procedures, and their brains were prepared for immunohistochemical c-Fos protein detection in the central, lateral, and in the anterior and posterior parts of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus. We found a high percentage of neurons expressing c-Fos in the anterior part of the basolateral nucleus after moderate training, and this percentage increased further after intense training. Moderate and intense training did not induce changes in c-Fos expression in the other explored amygdaloid regions. These results show that inhibitory avoidance training produces a localized expression of c-Fos in the basolateral anterior nucleus of the amygdala, which is dependent upon the intensity of training, and indicate that synaptic plastic changes in this region may be required for the formation of memory of moderate and intense aversive learning.;Basolateral amygdala | c-Fos | Extinction | Inhibitory avoidance | Intense training;0;0;;;CONACYT;203918;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Aims: The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of different weaning protocols on plasma cortisol concentrations, behavioural responses, and weight gain in water buffalo calves. Methods: In total, 40 Murrah buffalo calves (20 males, 20 females) aged 7-8 months and weighing 247.05 ± 33.23 kg were included. The animals were assigned to one of four treatments (10 per group, 5 males, 5 females), as follows: non-weaned calves (NoW); calves weaned abruptly on Day 0 (AW); calves fitted with nose-flaps anti-suckling devices on Day -7 and completely separated from their mothers on Day 0 (NFW); and calves separated from their mothers by a fence line on Day -7 and, then completely separated from their mothers on Day 0 (FENW). Plasma cortisol was measured on Days -7, -6, -4, 0, 1 and 3, while the behavioural variables were measured from Day -7 to Day -4, and from Day 0 to Day 3. The weight of the calves was evaluated on Days -9, -7, 0 and 3. Key results: AW calves presented higher cortisol concentrations than did NoW calves (P = 0.0002) and showed a marked increase in walking and decrease in grazing and ruminating on Days 0-3 compared with the other treatments (P < 0.0001). The use of NFW caused behavioural changes after the device placement and after the final separation from the mother (P < 0.0001). In FENW, behavioural changes were observed after the separation by a linear fence but no negative changes were observed after the final separation from the mothers, and positive behaviours such as grazing, rumination and exploration increased. No changes in weight gain were observed (P > 0.05). Conclusions: No clear effects were observed in the implementation of alternative weaning, since both NFW and FENW presented changes related to stress at weaning, compared with abrupt weaning. However, in FENW, no behavioural alterations were observed after definitive separation from their mothers. Implications: The application of fence-line separation before final separation could be a promising strategy to reduce stress at weaning in water buffalo calves. However, further studies are required to determinate its long-term effect.";buffalo calves | cortisol | stress | two-step weaning | weaning | welfare;2;0;;;;undefined;

The present study was conducted with high-performance Holando-Argentino cows. Our objective was to study TNF-α and its receptors pattern expression in cows from a region characterized by extreme climatic seasonality. Animals were evaluated in three periods: spring (n = 15), summer (n = 14) and autumn (n = 11). Meteorological records from a local station were used to estimate the temperature and humidity index (THI) by means of an equation previously defined. A THI higher than 68 is indicative of stressing conditions. During the summer period, the animals were exposed to 8.5 ± 1.09 h of heat stress, or THI > 68. In spring, stress hours were reduced to 1.4 ± 0.5 every day, while during the autumn, there were no recorded heat stress events. Expression of TNF-α, and its receptors was determined by qPCR. During the summer, TNF-α and its receptors expression diminished drastically compared to the rest of the year, when stressful conditions were infrequent. We conclude that animals that are not physiologically prepared to resist high temperatures might have a less efficient immune response, reinforcing the need to develop new strategies to improve animal welfare.;Cytokines | Dairy cattle | Heat stress | Immune response;7;0;;;CONICET;PIP 2014-2016;Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas

Results: Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and A. schindleri ACE could not use furfural as sole carbon source but when acetate was used as substrate, ADP1 and ACE biotransformed 1 g furfural/l in 5 and 9 h, respectively. In both cases, the product of this biotransformation was difurfuryl-ether as shown by FT-IR and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The presence of furfural decreased the specific growth rate in acetate by 27% in ADP1 and 53% in ACE. For both strains, the MIC of furfural was 1.25 g/l. Nonetheless, ADP1 biotransformed 2 g furfural/l at a rate of 1 g/l/h in the stationary phase of growth. A transcriptional analysis of possible dehydrogenases involved in this biotransformation, identified that the areB and frmA genes were highly overexpressed after the exposure of ADP1 to furfural. The products of these genes are a benzyl-alcohol dehydrogenase and an alcohol dehydrogenase. Conclusions: Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 is a candidate for the biological detoxification of furfural, a fermentation inhibitor present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, with the possible direct involvement of the AreB and FrmA enzymes in the process.;Acetate | Acinetobacter | Biotransformation | Furfural;1;0;;;CONACYT;CB-2012–01/183 813;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

For centuries LAB have been recognized as safe and employed for food processing due to their ability to control the adventurous microbiota in the elaboration of dairy products, vegetables, meats, coffee, cocoa, silages and fermented beverages; but also because of their contribution to the taste, flavor and texture. Moreover, probiotic LAB may offer health benefits by acting in the modulation of the immune system, helping to manage allergies and lactose intolerance; in addition to the prevention of gastrointestinal and urinary infections by reduction of pathogens. The ability of LAB to inhibit spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms is based on several mechanisms that include acidification, production of antimicrobials and competition for nutrients and adhesion niches. Antimicrobials include the lactic and acetic acids, but also a complex range of metabolites like hydrogen peroxide, diacetyl, antifungal short-chain fatty acids, pyroglutamic acid, as well as, antimicrobial peptides known as bacteriocins and antibacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases (PGHs). Bacteriocins refer to a diverse group of ribosomal antimicrobial peptides mainly active against closely-related and sensitive bacterial strains by formation of pores in the cytoplasmic membrane causing reduction of microbial competitors. Among them, nisin and other bacteriocins have been applied in the food and pharmaceutical industry to control Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. On the other hand, PGH are proteins capable to cleave the peptidoglycan cell wall of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, examples include lysostaphin and lysozyme, which are highly active against Staphylococcus aureus. The objective of this chapter is to offer an overview of the characteristics and applications of bacteriocins and peptidoglycan hydrolases as part of the beneficial metabolites produced by LAB.";;0;0;;;;undefined;

Although an early diagnosis can achieve tumor eradication with appropriate treatments, failure of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy still represents a major issue for complete elimination of tumor cells, and therefore, research on new strategies for cancer therapy is encouraged. One of these alternatives is the use of live-attenuated bacteria with antitumor properties. Among the different types of bacteria analyzed as possible antitumor agents, Salmonella enterica has been the most studied. Although Salmonella enterica tumor selectivity remains unclear, pre-clinical and clinical trials have shown its localization in solid, semi-solid and metastatic tumors. Once in the tumor microenvironment, these attenuated bacteria have the ability to induce or activate the innate or specific antitumor immune response, and the potential to be used as a Trojan horse to kill tumor cells by carrying cytotoxic molecules, pro-apoptotic proteins, immunomodulatory molecules, or transferring DNA into eukaryotic cells in a process called bactofection.

Although the nuclear mechanisms regulated by HDACs that control BDNF expression have been partially described recently, the temporal events for memory consolidation remain unknown. Hence, in this work, we studied the temporal pattern for the activation of the BDNF/TrkB pathway through class I HDAC inhibition to enhance object recognition memory (ORM) consolidation. To this end, we inhibited class I HDAC into the insular cortex (IC) and a weak ORM protocol was used to assess temporal expression and function of the BDNF/TrkB pathway in the IC. We found that cortical class I HDAC inhibition enhanced long-term ORM, coincident with a clear peak of BDNF expression at 4 h after acquisition. Furthermore, the tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor blockade at 4 h, but not at 8 h, impaired the consolidation of ORM. These results suggest that histone acetylation regulates the temporal expression of BDNF in cortical circuits potentiating the long-term recognition memory.;BDNF | Consolidation | HDAC inhibitor | Object recognition memory | TrkB;2;0;;;CONACYT;IN212919;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Abundance of its species have decreased and some ones have been placed on the threatened species list, because of overfishing, urbanization, industrialization, destruction, habitat fragmentation, pollution and exotic species introduction. Chirostoma jordani (Woolman, 1894) is a freshwater fish with biological, ecological, cultural, and commercial importance. It has a broad distribution in Lerma drainage, Durango and Mexico City. In this last locality, their populations, although small, still persist in Xochimilco Lake; it is necessary to implement biotechnologies for their conservation, because of these causes and their basic biology. The aim was to standardize a sperm cryopreservation protocol in C. jordani, to determine extender solution, cryoprotective agent type and concentration, equilibrium time, freezing and thawed rate to be applied in assisted reproduction and conservation of genus Chirostoma. Chirostoma jordani adult males were collected in Atlangatepec Dam, Tlaxcala State, Mexico, to fresh seminal evaluation and cryopreservation protocol standardization. Four cryoprotectants effect was evaluated: dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), methanol (MeOH), ethylene glycol (EG), and glycerol (GL) at five concentrations: 2%, 6%, 10%, 14% and 16% v/v. Higher and lower DMSO and MeOH 10% and EG 14%, decreased post-thaw motility percentage. Both DMSO and MeOH 10% and EG 14% had the highest post-thaw motility percentages, 48.8 ± 1.5%, 54.5 ± 1.0% and 53.5 ± 1.0%, at 15, 10, and 5 min equilibrium times, respectively, thawed at 40°C. Chirostoma jordani sperm can be cryopreserved with both DMSO and MeOH 10%, and EG 14%. These ones can be used for assisted reproduction.

In this work, we explore the capacity of an achiote seed extract and its main compounds to modulate the lifespan and antistress responses on Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as the mechanisms involved in these effects. Achiote lipophilic extract, bixin, and δ -tocotrienol were applied on nematodes to carry out lifespan, stress resistance, and fertility assays. The achiote seed extract increased the median and maximum lifespan up to 35% and 27% and increased resistance against oxidative and thermal stresses without adverse effects on fertility. The beneficial effects were mimicked by a bixin+ δ -tocotrienol mixture. All the effects on lifespan and stress resistance were independent of caloric restriction but dependent on the insulin/insulin growth factor-1 pathway.

It has been stated that long-term exposure to estrogens is associated with a higher incidence of breast cancer, since estradiol (E2) stimulates breast cell growth; however, its effect on DNA damage/repair is only starting to be investigated. Recent studies have documented that estrogens are able to modify the DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair mechanisms. On the other hand, it has been proposed that DDR machinery can be altered by estrogen signaling pathways, that can be related to cancer progression and chemoresistance. We have demonstrated that E2 promotes c-Src activation and breast cancer cell motility, through a non-genomic pathway. This review discusses scientific evidence supporting this non-genomic mechanism where estrogen modifies the DNA repair pathways, and its relationship to potential causes of chemoresistance.";breast cancer | c-Src activation | chemoresistance | DNA damage response (DDR) | DNA repair mechanisms | estrogen receptor;3;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;INFR-2016-01-270227;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Behavioral traits are recognized as key to promote individual’s survival in changing conditions. For social species being part of a group is key to carry out vital activities. Heterospecific social environments could provide exotic species with the opportunity to join groups and gain the advantages of being part of a larger population. Short latency to exit a refuge is a behavioral response that could be linked to invasion success as it increases the chances of individuals to locate food sources and other resources in novel environments. The guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a successful invader, has been found to take advantage of the presence of native species to reduce its refuge emergence latency and acquire information. The research was carried out in Mexico, we investigated the effect of heterospecific social contexts that include natives and other invasive viviparous fishes on guppies’ refuge emergence latency. We found that guppies’ emergence latency was shorter when accompanied by another guppy than when alone. Their latency was also shorter when with other invaders and when with native goodeids, but with one of the invaders (Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus) and with goodeids (Skiffia bilineata) latency reduction was not as high as when with conspecifics or with the invader Poecilia gracilis. Our experiment supports both the idea that already established invaders could provide benefits to new ones, and that native species also provide benefits but less than invaders. Increasing our knowledge about conspecific and heterospecific social interactions that could make an exotic species become invasive is key to assess the invasion risk of a community.;goodeids | heterospecific interactions | poeciliids | risk-taking behavior | social context;4;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;IA202419;

Accordingly, we first describe the color pattern in both sexes to define its phenotypical variations. We then analyze the frequency of these phenotypes on a geographical scale, in four localities that represent opposite points of Millerichthys’s distribution in the Mexican southeast. Color analysis based on the RGB system allowed us to define five-color phenotypes in males continuously distributed in various perceptual units between two extreme colors (yellow-red): yellow, moderate orange, dark orange, strong orange and red. These color patterns found in M. robustus could be attributed to melanin, carotenoid, and pteridine pigments. The orange phenotypes was present in all localities studied. The yellow phenotype was present only in northeastern and northwestern locations, and the red phenotype was present only in northern populations. Female color variations were observed in the number of ocelli (from 1 to 15) at the base of the caudal peduncle and dorsal region. Ocelli have been associated with anti-predator functions because they resemble the eyes of vertebrates, thus shifting the target of predator attacks to less vital body parts. Females with 3 ocelli were the most frequent phenotype, and females with 13–15 ocelli occurred only in the northern populations. We concluded that male and female of M. robustus are not randomly distributed along their distribution range, which suggest that color phenotypes may react differently to biotic and abiotic factors that probably determine their distribution and frequency within the studied population.;Color polymorphism | Fish phenotypes | Morphotypes | RGB system;1;0;;;;undefined;

Individuals use this plant to fall asleep, to calm states of nervous excitement, headaches, mood disorders, and general discomfort. Recent studies indicated that fractions standardized in their flavonoid content possess antidepressant activity in behavioral assays in mice. The present study aims to focus on the evaluation of the antidepressant effect of the mixture of two flavonoids (FMix), and its interaction with serotonergic drugs. Also, the pharmacological effect of the products of the metabolism of aglycone, quercetin, was evaluated in mice subjected to forced swimming test (FST) and open field test (OFT). Materials and methods: A methanol-soluble extract obtained from leaves of Tilia americana was fractionated in an open column chromatographic separation. One of the fractions contained FMix wich is constituted of the mixture of quercetin 4′-O-rhamnoside (1, 47%) y isoquercitrin (2, 53%). The mice were divided into the several following groups: FMix (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2 mg/kg); FMix (1.0 mg/kg) and agonist DOI (2.0 mg/kg); FMix (1.0 mg/kg) and antagonist ketanserin (KET, 0.03 mg/kg) of 5-HT2A receptors; FMix (1.0 mg/kg) and selective agonist 8-OH-DPAT (8-OH, 0.01 mg/kg); FMix (1.0 mg/kg) and antagonist WAY100635 (WAY, 0.5 mg/kg) of 5HT1 receptors; Phloroglucinol (PHL); 3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl acid (DOPAC); p-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid (p-HPAA); and m-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid (m-HPAA) were tested in FST or OFT. Results: FMix induced dependent-dose antidepressant activity and, at the highest dose administered, a sedative effect was also observed. The 8-OH-DPAT, or the DOI, or the KET combination with FMix (1.0 mg/kg) induced a higher antidepressant effect than compounds alone; there was no effect exerted with WAY. The activity on OFT increased only with the FMix and KET combination. At the same time, the products of the aglycone metabolism of quercetin, that is, DOPAC and p-HPAA, decreased the immobility time of the mice in FST at 1.0 mg/kg, and a dose-curve was formed for these. Conclusion: The antidepressant effect of FMix could depend, at least in part, on the degradation products of quercetin and with a possible action mode through interaction with the serotoninergic system.";5-HT | Depression | DOPAC | Isoquercitrin | p-HPAA | Phloroglucinol | Quercetin 4′-O-Rhamnoside | Tilia americana;8;0;;;CONACYT;99186327;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The poor clinical prognosis and lack of successful treatments for metastatic breast cancer patients demand the development of new tumor-selective therapies. Thus, it is necessary to develop treatments capable of releasing therapeutic agents to both primary tumors and metastases that avoid toxic side effects in normal tissue, and neural stem cells are an attractive vehicle for tracking tumor cells and delivering anti-cancer agents. The authorspreviously demonstrated that a soluble form of growth arrest specific 1 (GAS1) inhibits the growth of triple-negative breast tumors and glioblastoma. Methods: In this study, the authors engineered ReNcell CX (EMD Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) neural progenitor cells to express truncated GAS1 (tGAS1) under a tetracycline/on inducible system using lentiviral vectors. Results: Here the authors show that treatment with ReNcell-tGAS1 in combination with tetracycline decreased primary tumor growth and inhibited the formation of metastases in tumor-bearing mice by diminishing the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in orthotopic mammary gland tumors. Moreover, the authors observed that ReNcell-tGAS1 prolonged the survival of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions: These data suggest that the delivery of tGAS1 by ReNcell cells could be an effective adjuvant for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.;breast cancer | gene therapy | growth arrest specific 1 | metastases | neural stem cells;2;0;;;CONACYT;1563;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

During symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes, these cofactors are needed for de novo purine biosynthesis, meaning that changes in the folate pools could directly affect the flow of fixed nitrogen to the plant. Its role related to symbiotic nitrogen fixation has not been yet explored, but recent data suggest a relevant role during the first steps. Transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic analyses indicate that folates are accumulated in symbiotic plant tissue, as they are involved, not only in de novo purines biosynthesis, but in nitrogen translocation, endoreduplication and phytohormones biosynthesis. Understanding the possible implication of folate pools during the nitrogen fixation and assimilation, might aid for new engineering targets, in relation to the two transformylations or the production of glycine by serine hydroxymethyltransferase during the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. In this review, we intend to deliver and discuss the available evidence that support a relevant role of folates during the symbiotic nitrogen fixation.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Genetic variants in the LIPC gene have been associated with both conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the association of the -514C < T (rs1800588) LIPC gene polymorphism with different metabolic traits, particularly the effects of this polymorphism on HDL-C plasma levels and T2D risk. Methods: Mediation analysis was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of the -514C>T LIPC gene variant on HDL-C levels, T2D risk, and body mass index (BMI), in 2105 Mexican mestizo participants. We also assessed the functional effect of the -514C>T LIPC variant on the promoter activity of a reporter gene in the HepG2 cell line. Results: Direct effects show that the -514C>T LIPC polymorphism is significantly associated with increased HDL-C plasma levels (β = 0.03; p < 0.001). The -514C>T variant resulted in an indirect protective effect on T2D risk through increasing HDL-C levels (β = − 0.03; p < 0.001). Marginal direct association between -514C>T and T2D was found (β = 0.08; p = 0.06). Variables directly influencing T2D status were European ethnicity (β = − 7.20; p < 0.001), age (β = 0.04; p < 0.001), gender (β = − 0.15; p = 0.017) and HDL-C (β = − 1.07; p < 0.001). In addition, we found that the -514C>T variant decreases the activity of LIPC promoter by 90% (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The -514C>T polymorphism was not directly associated with T2D risk. HDL-C acts as a mediator between -514C>T LIPC gene variant and T2D risk in the Mexican population.";HDL | HDL-C | LIPC | rs1800588 | Type 2 diabetes;2;0;;;CONACYT;170090;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

These compounds belong to a large group of substances termed endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC). It is well known that humans and living organisms are unavoidably and unintentionally exposed to BPA and phthalates from food packaging materials and many other everyday products. BPA and phthalates exert their effect by interfering with hormone synthesis, bioavailability, and action, thereby altering cellular proliferation and differentiation, tissue development, and the regulation of several physiological processes. In fact, these EDC can alter fetal programming at an epigenetic level, which can be transgenerational transmitted and may be involved in the development of various chronic pathologies later in the adulthood, including metabolic, reproductive and degenerative diseases, and certain types of cancer. In this review, we describe the most recent proposed mechanisms of action of these EDC and offer a compelling selection of experimental, epidemiological and clinical studies, which show evidence of how exposure to these pollutants affects our health during development, and their association with a wide range of reproductive, metabolic and neurological diseases, as well as hormone-related cancers. We stress the importance of concern in the general population and the urgent need for the medical health care system to closely monitor EDC levels in the population due to unavoidable and involuntary exposure to these pollutants and their impact on human health.;Bisphenol A | Endocrine disruptors | Epidemiology | Hormones | Human health | Phthalates;20;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;CONACYT;5895;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Modern CNN architectures are often composed of many convolutional and some fully connected layers, and have thousands or millions of parameters. CNNs have shown to be effective in the detection of Event-Related Potentials from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, notably the P300 component which is frequently employed in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, for this task, the increase in detection rates compared to approaches based on human-engineered features has not been as impressive as in other areas and might not justify such a large number of parameters. In this paper, we study the performance of existing CNN architectures with diverse complexities for single-trial within-subject and cross-subject P300 detection on four different datasets. We also proposed SepConv1D, a very simple CNN architecture consisting of a single depthwise separable 1D convolutional layer followed by a fully connected Sigmoid classification neuron. We found that with as few as four filters in its convolutional layer and an overall small number of parameters, SepConv1D obtained competitive performances in the four datasets. We believe these results may represent an important step towards building simpler, cheaper, faster, and more portable BCIs.;Convolutional neural network | Cross-subject | P300 | Single-trial | Within-subject;7;0;repositoryam;Green;UNAM;IA104016;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

Aim of the study: This work assessed the diuretic, antinociceptive, and anti-inflammatory actions of an ethanol extract from the leaves and stems of Eryngium carlinae (ECE). These ethnomedicinal properties of ECE were scientifically validated using in vitro and in vivo assays. Materials and methods: The antinociceptive and diuretic actions of ECE (10–200 mg/kg p.o.) were assessed with the acetic acid-induced writhing test and by using metabolic cages to house mice, respectively. The in vitro anti-inflammatory actions of ECE (1–500 μg/ml) were evaluated using LPS-stimulated primary murine macrophages, and the in vivo anti-inflammatory actions were assessed using the TPA-induced ear edema test (2 mg/ear) and carrageenan-induced paw edema test (50–200 mg/kg p.o.). The production of inflammatory mediators was estimated using in vitro and in vivo assays. Results: ECE lacked antinociceptive and diuretic effects. ECE increased the production of IL-10 in LPS-stimulated macrophages (EC50 = 37.8 pg/ml) and the carrageenan-induced paw edema test (ED50 = 82.6 mg/kg). ECE showed similar in vivo anti-inflammatory actions compared to those observed with indomethacin.

Loss-of-function mutations in the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) are an infrequent cause of primary ovarian failure. Objective: To analyze the molecular physiopathogenesis of a novel mutation in the FSHR identified in a woman with primary ovarian failure, employing in vitro and in silico approaches, and to compare the features of this dysfunctional receptor with those shown by the trafficking-defective D408Y FSHR mutant. Methods: Sanger sequencing of the FSHR cDNA was applied to identify the novel mutation. FSH-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and desensitization were tested in HEK293 cells. Receptor expression was analyzed by immunoblotting, receptor-binding assays, and flow cytometry. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to determine the in silico behavior of the mutant FSHRs. Results: A novel missense mutation (I423T) in the second transmembrane domain of the FSHR was identified in a woman with normal pubertal development but primary amenorrhea. The I423T mutation slightly impaired plasma membrane expression of the mature form of the receptor and severely impacted on cAMP/protein kinase A signaling but much less on β-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Meanwhile, the D408Y mutation severely affected membrane expression, with most of the FSH receptor located intracellularly, and both signal readouts tested. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed important functional disruptions in both mutant FSHRs, mainly the loss of interhelical connectivity in the D408Y FSHR. Conclusions: Concurrently, these data indicate that conformational differences during the inactive and active states account for the distinct expression levels, differential signaling, and phenotypic expression of the I423T and D408Y mutant FSHRs.;follicle-stimulating hormone | follicle-stimulating hormone receptor | gonadotropins | inactivating mutations | primary ovarian failure;4;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Elevated brain KYNA levels are commonly seen in psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases and may be related to cognitive impairments. Recently, we showed that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibits kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), KYNA’s key biosynthetic enzyme, and reduces KYNA neosynthesis in rats in vivo. In this study, we examined if repeated systemic administration of NAC influences brain KYNA and cognitive performance in mice. Animals received NAC (100 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 7 days. Redox markers, KYNA levels, and KAT II activity were determined in the brain. We also assessed the effect of repeated NAC treatment on Trp catabolism using brain tissue slices ex vivo. Finally, learning and memory was evaluated with and without an acute challenge with KYNA’s bioprecursor L-kynurenine (Kyn; 100 mg/kg). Subchronic NAC administration protected against an acute pro-oxidant challenge, decreased KYNA levels, and lowered KAT II activity and improved memory both under basal conditions and after acute Kyn treatment. In tissue slices from these mice, KYNA neosynthesis from Trp or Kyn was reduced. Together, our data indicate that prolonged treatment with NAC may enhance memory at least in part by reducing brain KYNA levels.";Kynurenic acid | Kynurenine | Learning and memory | N-acetylcysteine;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;USPHS;P-50 MH103222;U.S. Public Health Service

NAFLD is a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to hepatic carcinoma. The complexity of pathomechanisms makes treatment difficult. The oral antidiabetic agents, dipeptidyl peptidase four inhibitors (DPP-4i) have been proposed as possible therapeutic agents. This study was performed using a well-established NAFLD model in rats to elucidate whether sitagliptin could prevent steatohepatitis. Rats were fed a methionine/choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sitagliptin treatment for six weeks. Liver tissue was examined to estimate sitagliptin's effect on the development of NASH. The MCD diet decreased the SAM/SAH ratio, and increased plasma levels of homocysteine, free fatty acids, and long-chain acylcarnitines in the MCD rats. MMP2 and Col1A2 expression also increased under the MCD diet. Sitagliptin treatment did not reverse these effects and increased steatosis and long-chain acylcarnitines. In conclusion, sitagliptin was ineffective to prevent from NAFLD in the MCD rat model. This result challenges previous data reporting beneficial effects and is consistent with the clinical trials’ negative results.;MCD | Methyl donors | NAFLD | NASH | Sitagliptin | Wistar rats;1;0;;;Inserm;undefined;Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale

The systematic checklist comprises 183 species from 55 families. The most representative families were Serranidae (14 species), Carangidae (13), Muraenidae, and Labridae (11 each). The highest representativeness at the zone level was obtained at Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo (158 species), Huatulco (141), Acapulco (121), Puerto Ángel (62), and Puerto Escondido (39). Sample-based rarefactions showed that the biological inventory at the regional level has a representativeness of 90.51%. The PERMANOVA results showed that the fish assemblage differs among zones, while the SIMPER analysis showed that the variability is a product of the species dissimilarity among zones, mainly among the cryptobenthic, highly mobile, and seasonal species. The average taxonomic distinctiveness (Δ+) shows that Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo has greater taxonomic diversity, followed by Acapulco and Huatulco with intermediate Δ+ values, while Puerto Escondido and Puerto Ángel have the lowest Δ+. Overall beta diversity (βSOR) was mostly due to nestedness (βSNE = 0.167) rather than spatial turnover (βSIM = 0.365), while pairwise turnover species (βsim) was high between Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo vs. Puerto Escondido and Huatulco vs. Puerto Angel.

However, information on the potential of micromineral supplements in this regard is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of 20 mg (control) and 40 mg Cu (from supplemental CuSO4)/kg dietary dry matter (DM) on nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation characteristics, and enteric CH4 emissions measured with the tracing technique of sulfur hexafluoride. Six Holstein bulls were divided into two groups of three animals and assigned to one of two experimental diets in a crossover design. Percentages of apparent digestibility of DM, neutral detergent fiber, and N did not differ (P>0.05) between treatments. Supplemental Cu decreased (P<0.001) total tract digestibility of Cu by 25%. There were no differences (P>0.05) between treatments in ruminal fluid pH or, acetate:propionate ratio. Emission of CH4 tended (P<0.1) to decrease by 23% with supplemental Cu. This study showed that 40 mg Cu/kg dietary DM is a feasible dietary level in cattle, because supplemental Cu from CuSO4 did not impair nutrient digestibility and tended to decrease enteric CH4 emissions.;Cattle | Copper | Digestion | Methane | Sulfur hexafluoride;1;0;;;;undefined;

Methods: A total of 54 twin St. Croix 60-days-old weaned lambs were assigned to one of four treatments: (i) the presence of undocked twins and no provision of straw (U); (ii) the provision of straw and no presence of undocked twins (St); (iii) the provision of straw and the presence of undocked twins (StU); and (iv) no provision of straw and no presence of undocked twins (C). Straw was provided as bed material over the concrete floor; whereas the presence of undocked twins was achieved by leaving one twin intact within each pair. From the placement of the rubber rings, the behaviour of tail-docked twins was video recorded continuously for 60 min, and blood samples were taken from these lambs immediately before placing the rubber ring (time 0), and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 24, 48 and 72 h after, for cortisol and physio-metabolic profiles determination, and at 168 h after, for cortisol determination. Key results: Lambs in treatment C spent three times longer in abnormal lying postures (P = 0.002) compared with St and StU lambs (6.49 ± 4.73 vs 1.78 ± 1.26 and 1.83 ± 1.94 min respectively). Lambs in all treatments experienced an increase in cortisol levels 1 h after tail docking, except for StU lambs. In addition, 48 and 72 h after tail docking, lambs in treatments St and StU had lower concentrations of cortisol than C lambs. Conclusion: This study shows that the provision of straw and the presence of undocked twins reduce the behavioural and physiological expressions of pain associated with tail docking in lambs. Implications: In lambs raised under intensive conditions, the addition of straw as bedding material and the presence of intact tail lambs could be a practical strategy to improve the welfare of tail-docked lambs, whereas for those lambs raised under extensive conditions, leaving intact those lambs that will be sold might serve as social buffering for their tail-docked conspecifics that will remain in the farm.";Animal welfare | Husbandry practice | Pain | Sheep;3;0;;;CONICYT;21150880;Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica

An opinion poll was conducted among 270 scientists who received academic training at universities in Mexico, Europe, and the United States, and who work at three universities in Mexico. The instrument is based on a social psychology theory that divides memories into spontaneous and assisted, and a dichotomous probability distribution was used to identify variations. Between eight and nine out of ten researchers from physical, biological, and social sciences recognized that there are four rules for research: to study reality as it is, have a critical attitude, have a methodological aptitude, and express willingness to openly publish results. Despite the heterogeneity of the disciplines researchers practice and the variety of their academic training, there is a consensus among scientists about the validity of such rules to conduct scientific research, although most of the time they do not mention them spontaneously.";Epistemology of science | Methodology | Science | Scientific investigation | Sociology of science;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The aim of this study was to find out if any neurological dysfunction in preschool children secondary to damage generated during the perinatal period is associated with the magnitude of perinatal risks and long-term modifications in the serum concentrations of inflammatory molecules. The participants, aged 1–4 years, were on neurodevelopmental follow-up and rehabilitation therapy from the first three months of life and had no acute disease data. We classified the children into three groups according to the importance of their perinatal risks: low, medium, and high. The results show that 1) the magnitude of perinatal risks correlated with the severity of neurological dysfunction; 2) the greatest changes in the concentrations of the molecules of the inflammatory process were associated with the most altered neurological signs. This suggests that persistent nervous system dysfunction keeps inflammatory responses active even in the absence of an acute process of infection or damage.";inflammation | neurodevelopment | neurological signs | perinatal risks | sequelae;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The large surface area of this material improves drug loading and drug release. Typically, SBA-15 is produced by a cooperative self-assembly process under acidic conditions using the triblock copolymers as template and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as the silica sources under conventional and batched process. In the last years, spray drying has been proposed to reduce the time to obtain SBA-15 (dry and not calcined) to just seconds, whereas with conventional techniques, this process can take from 6 to 48 h. Additionally, the loading, dissolution, and stability of drugs are improved using co-spray drying (SBA-15 and drugs) due to the pore spatial confinement and avoiding the re-crystallization process of drugs. Furthermore, drug-loaded SBA-15 particles obtained by spray drying have a defined size, high sphericity, and easy handling these characteristics are relevant to its incorporation in dosage forms. Several factors influence the final characteristics of SBA-15 drug-loaded particles, for mention a few: precursors, solvents, time of aging, the temperature of drying, pressure, etc. In this review, the key parameters for the synthesis and loading of drugs on SBA-15 using the spray drying technique are explored and analyzed giving information about how these parameters impact the loading, dissolution, and stability of drugs.;drug delivery | drug-loading | SBA-15 | silica microparticles | Spray drying;0;0;;;CONACYT;2203800268;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Many taxonomic studies have recognized Chirostoma and Poblana as well-defined genera. Genetic analyses, however, indicate that Poblana is nested within Chirostoma, while other authors synonymize all silversides of the Central Plateau of Mexico within Menidia. Nevertheless, the differentiation between these genera has not currently been explored through a morphometric analysis. Goals: Under this scenario, in which the taxonomic validity of the genus Menidia is not in doubt, but the existence of Poblana is uncertain given that for some authors it pertains to the genus Chirostoma, the morphometric variations among the three genera and their species were analyzed in this study through Geometric Morphometrics. Methods: Seventeen landmarks were used on a sample of 393 Mexican specimens from various biological collections (216 of Chirostoma, 150 of Poblana and 27 of Menidia) obtained from several localities. The differences among the genera and species were tested using a Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA) computing the regression of shape on size-the vector of allometry, then remove this aspect of variation by looking at residual variation. Results: The cross-validated analysis showed 98.5% and 84.2% of classification among genera and species respectively, where the misclassifications were among species of Chirostoma. Conclusions: Morphometric differences were found among Poblana, Chirostoma and Menidia, therefore considered as discrete units.;Atherinopsidae | Central Plateau | Generalized Procrustes Analysis | Mexico | Silversides;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Chronic exposure to neonicotinoids in humans is related to autism, memory loss, and finger tremor. In this article, we evaluate the effect of subchronic oral administration of two neonicotinoids in the same mixture: clothianidin and thiacloprid. Decreasing doses of both pesticides were administered to rats starting from the lethal dose 50 (LD50) reported by the manufacturer. Our results indicate that the administration of three doses of decreasing amounts of LD50 (5/10, 4/10, and 3/10 LD50) resulted in 100% death in all cases. Ten administration times of 2/10 LD50 of the mixture caused only 20% of death cases after twenty-seven days, which was determined as a subchronic administration scheme. The animals administered 2/10 LD50 showed behavioral alterations after the first and second administration. Electrographic studies showed abnormal discharge patterns in the CNS. 72 h after the tenth dose, learning and memory tests were performed in the Morris water maze. Our results revealed significant decreases in permanence at the quadrant and the number of crosses (P=0.0447, P=0.0193, respectively), which represent alterations in the short-term memory test, but there were no significant changes in a long-term memory test. Likewise, the brains of these animals showed tissue architecture loss, nucleosomal retraction, and a significant increase in the pycnosis of the granular neurons of the dentate gyrus analyzed at 72 h after the last dose (P=0.0125). Toxic effects and cognitive deterioration that have been found in communities living near contaminated areas are probably related to the agricultural use of neonicotinoids.;;0;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Adenosine acts through specific receptors and is a negative inotropic and chronotropic agent. Blockage of its cardiac receptors can cause tachycardia (with arrhythmogenic potential) due to the intense activity of β1 receptors. In terms of tissue protection, caffeine inhibits hyperoxia-induced pulmonary inflammation by decreasing proinflammatory cytokine expression in animal models. The protection that caffeine provides to tissues is not limited to the CNS, as studies have demonstrated that it generates attenuation of inflammatory effects in pulmonary tissue. It inhibits the effects of some pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevents functional and structural changes.";Animal model | Caffeine | Cardiorespiratory effect | Tissue protection;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Here, we assessed the effect of the biotic and abiotic components that configure the microhabitat heterogeneity and its temporal shifts (dry and rainy seasons), on the frequency (total and by sex) of two congeneric species, Peromyscus difficilis and P. melanotis, that co-occurs in a temperate forest of Central Mexico. To address this, an experimental plot composed of 120 sampling stations was placed within a temperate forest in the National Park Desierto de los Leones, Mexico City. In each sampling station, we set Sherman traps to capture mice of two syntopic Peromyscus, and we also evaluated six variables related to the spatial heterogeneity of the habitat during two rainy seasons. Our results revealed differential effects of habitat heterogeneity on the frequency of each species. Moreover, habitat heterogeneity also had a different effect on male and female frequencies of each Peromyscus species. While P. difficilis was captured more frequently in sampling stations with high presence and coverage of logs in the soil, P. melanotis was regularly captured in sampling stations with high vegetation cover and plant species richness. Thus, it seems that the different requirements and habitat preferences of these two Peromyscus species facilitate their spatial and temporal coexistence in this mid-latitude temperate forest. In general, we provide evidence of the importance of studying the heterogeneity of the habitat to better understand the interactions between syntopic species, offering new insights into the spatial and temporal mechanisms that could determine its coexistence at local scale.;Desierto de los Leones | Habitat preferences | Microhabitat | Niche partitioning | Small mammals’ conservation | Species interactions;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;283799;

As a consequence of this massive accumulations of Sargassum holopelagic species in Caribbean Sea have been generated and that threaten local biodiversity and trigger economic losses associated with beach deterioration and impact on fisheries and tourism. Goals: This document quantifies the occurrence of an excessive drift of Sargassum in two sites (Puerto Viejo and Punta Uva) of the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, Limón province, in March-April of 2019. A macroalgae species checklist is presented from six sites (Punta Cahuita, Puerto Vargas, Puerto Viejo, Playa Chiquita, Punta Uva and Manzanillo) in the Caribbean. In addition, the Sargassum morphotypes are quantified for the study area. Methods: Transects (50 m) were located parallel to the shoreline and, in points previously estimated, a quadrat of 25 x 25 cm covered the entire Sargassum band width on the beach until the water line, by fliping the quadrats and collecting the biomass for as many quadrats were necessary for the band. Then, pelagic Sargassum biomass was weighted in every point, and the dry weight biomass was estimated. Three quadrats were collected by the transect method. Associated species were identified as well as Sargassum morphotypes in all sites. Results: Descriptions that illustrate the morphology of the three morphotypes of pelagic species. The putatively rare S. natans VIII dominated the dritf (65 % dry weight), followed by S. natans I (25% dry weight), and S. fluitans (10 % dry). Twenty eight species were identified from Chlorophyta (9), Ochrophyta (15), and Rhodophyta (4) Divisions.

Study selection: Articles were included if they were carried out with healthy adult athletes of different levels of sports experience, in which the association of negative EB and low EA with SHC and with EII was evaluated. Study Appraisal and Synthesis: Of 198 records identified, 61 studies were assessed, and 26 documents met the inclusion criteria. Results: Similar associations between EB and EA (directly measured) with basal concentrations of testosterone, TNF- , and amenorrhea's presence, but not with estradiol and α IL-6, were obtained. EA (directly measured), compared to low EA surrogates, was associated with SHC in fewer studies (6 versus 11). At rest, highly trained athletes with low EB or low EA, compared to their counterparts with an adequate energy intake, showed lower levels of LH and estradiol, but not of progesterone and IL-6; although inconsistent results of testosterone, FSH, TNF-α, and amenorrhea's presence.

Several studies have shown differences in wing morphology, flight performance, and forage aerospheres among species from different trophic guilds. However, for species that share a guild this is not entirely clear. It is possible that these species have differences in their diet and show changes in wing morphology that modify their flight performance and forage areas. Determining this will allow a better understanding of spatial segregation among species that share a trophic guild. These studies allow the identification of species assemblages based on wing morphological differences and flight performance that would not be distinguished only by guild mem-bership. Our goal was to define the species assemblages that make up a community of Neotropical cave dwelling bats based on their trophic guild, flight performance, and forage zone. A community of Neotropical cave dwelling bats from a cave in Veracruz, Mexico was analyzed. The diet of each species was determined by means of their stomach contents and bibliographic review. In addition, aspect ratio, wing loading and tip index were calculated. Based on the wing characteristics and diet, multivariate groupings and orders were performed, as well as to define the assemblages present. According to the wing characteristics and the dietary composition, four groups of species were found that represent four different flight characteristics in terms of agility and maneuverability. There was agreement between diet and wing characteristics, and the four trophic groups were identified through canonical correspondence analysis. Correlating wing morphology, diet and forage area allows us to adequately define the assemblages of a community of bats. Regarding the hypothesis, it was found that species that share a food guild show differences in the composition of their food and wing morphology, which generate differences in flight performance and forage areas. Four assemblages differing in forage aerospheres among three trophic guilds are described: understory and facultative artrhopodivorous, semi-clearing hematophages, and facultative nectarivores.

Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged as a public health concern on the American continent during late 2015. As the number of infected grew so did the concerns about its capability to cause long-term damage especially with the appearance of the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Proteins from the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were proposed as the cellular receptors, however, due to the ability of the virus to infect a variety of cell lines different strategies to elucidate the tropism of the virus should be investigated. Hypothesis. Pseudotyping is a powerful tool to interrogate the ability of the glycoprotein (GP) to permit entry of viruses. Aim. We aimed to establish a highly tractable pseudotype model using lenti- and retro-viral backbones to investigate the entry pathway of ZIKV. Methodology. We used different glycoprotein constructs and different lenti- or retro-viral backbones, in a matrix of ratios to investigate production of proteins and functional pseudotypes. Results. Varying the ratio of backbone and glycoprotein plasmids did not yield infectious pseudotypes. Moreover, the supplementation of the ZIKV protease or the substitution of the backbone had no positive impact on the infectivity. We showed production of the proteins in producer cells implying the lack of infectious pseudotypes is due to a lack of successful glycoprotein incorporation, rather than lack of protein production. Conclusion. In line with other reports, we were unable to successfully produce infectious pseudotypes using the variety of methods described. Other strategies may be more suitable in the development of an efficient pseudotype model for ZIKV and other flaviviruses.;Glycoprotein | Pseudotype | Zika virus;0;0;repositoryvor;Green;MRC;MR/R010307/1;Medical Research Council

OSO impairs physical activity and mobility, provoking autonomy loss; also, it is known that augmenting body fat in the elderly decreases life expectancy. The main factors influencing this health deterioration are the inflammatory environment induced by adipose tissue and its infiltration into muscle tissue, which leads to oxidative stress generation. Currently, there are several treatments to delay OSO, among which exercise training stands out because it improves muscle fiber quality and quantity and decreases adipose tissue. We have recently demonstrated that the combined treatment between moderate exercise and metformin slows sarcopenia's onset by a mechanism that includes adipose reduction and REDOX regulation. On the other hand, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) is a well-known antioxidant that counteracts oxidative stress. Therefore, to slow down obesity's harmful effects on muscle mass and bone mineral density, we performed different interventions, including combining a Fartlek-Type exercise routine with metformin and tBHQ administration, in a model of middle-Aged female Wistar rats with obesity induced with a hypercaloric diet. Our results showed that the combined exercise-metformin-TBHQ treatment increased muscle mass and strength, decreased body weight, body mass index, and fat percentage, and improved redox status, thus increasing animal survival.";;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Our objectives were to evaluate the habitat use of these species and the environmental interactions between them throughout the overlapping areas of their home ranges in temperate forests of Durango, México. We expected that their coexistence would be facilitated by the spatial segregation of their ecological niche, exhibited by the low or nil overlap between their home ranges or by differentiated habitat use. Radio-collars (VHF) were attached to nine individuals - four coyotes (two males and two females) and five gray foxes (females) - that were radio-tracked from September 2017 to August 2019. We estimated their home ranges and the size of their core areas through the minimum convex polygon and determined the extent of overlap between them. Also, we evaluated third-order habitat selection and use based on habitat availability using Manly’s habitat-selection ratios and simultaneous Bonferroni confidence intervals (95 %). The mean home range size for coyotes was larger (12.2 ± 1.74 km2) than for gray boxes (5.3 ± 0.67 km2); the interspecific mean overlap was 42 % (moderate). Of these two canids, just the gray fox showed a markedly selective habitat use. Our findings revealed a moderate overlap between the home ranges of both canids, so spatial segregation did not occur. Although a differential habitat use was observed, explaining the coexistence between these two canids in the areas where they thrive, they tend to avoid agonistic interactions.";Biosphere reserve | Canis latrans | Coexistence | Durango | Habitat use | Home range | Overlap | Radiotelemetry | Segregation | Urocyon cinereoargenteus;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

In this work, we studied 11 designed hydrophobic-polar sequences, S1-S8 folded in 2D-square lattice, and S9-S11 folded in 3D-cubic lattice. And to better fold these structures we have developed Model 2 as an approximation to convex function aimed to weight hydrophobic-hydrophobic but also polar-polar contacts as an augmented version of Model 1. In this partitioned approach hydrophobic-hydrophobic ponderation was tuned as α-1 and polar-polar ponderation as α. This model is centered in preserving required hydrophobic substructure, and at the same time including polar-polar interactions, otherwise absent, to reach a better folding score now also acquiring the polar-polar substructure. In all tested cases the folding trials were better achieved with Model 2, using α values of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 depending of sequence size, even finding optimal scores not reached with Model 1. An important result is that the better folding score, required the lower α weighting. And when α values above 0.3 are employed, no matter the nature of the hydrophobic-polar sequence, banning of hydrophobic-hydrophobic contacts started, thus yielding misfolding of sequences. Therefore, the value of α to correctly fold structures is the result of a careful weighting among hydrophobic-hydrophobic and polar-polar contacts.;convex function | genetic algorithm | HP model | polar contacts | protein folding/structure;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;0222872;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This deterioration can seriously compromise the elderly's health and reduce their quality of life. In addition to age, there are other factors that induce muscle mass loss, among which are sedentary lifestyle, chronic diseases, inflammation, and obesity. In recent years, a new clinical condition has been observed in older adults that affects their physical capacities and quality of life, which is known as osteosarcopenic obesity (OSO). Osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and obesity coexist in this condition. Physical exercise and nutritional management are the most widely used interventions for the treatment and prevention of sarcopenia. However, in older adults, physical exercise and protein intake do not have the same outcomes observed in younger people. Here, we used a low-intensity exercise routine for a long period of time (LIERLT) in order to delay the OSO appearance related to sedentarism and aging in female Wistar rats. The LIERLT routine consisted of walking at 15 m/min for 30 min, five days a week for 20 months. To evaluate the effects of the LIERLT routine, body composition was determined using DXA-scan, additionally, biochemical parameters, inflammatory profile, oxidative protein damage, redox state, and serum concentration of GDF-11 at different ages were evaluated (4, 8, 12, 18, 22, and 24 months). Our results show that the LIERLT routine delays OSO phenotype in old 24-month-old rats, in a mechanism involving the decrease in the inflammatory state and oxidative stress. GDF-11 was evaluated as a protein related to muscle repair and regeneration; interestingly, rats that perform the LIERLT increased their GDF-11 levels.";;5;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

As the diagnosis confirmation is performed by a postmortem neuropathological examination of the brain, this disease can be confused with other types of dementia at early stages. About 860,000 Mexicans are affected by dementia, most of them with insufficient access to adequate comprehensive health care services. Plasma biomarkers could be a rapid option for early diagnosis of the disease. Objective: This study aimed to analyze some plasma biomarkers (amyloid-β, tau, and lipids) in Mexican AD patients and control subjects with no associated neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: Plasma amyloid-β peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42), total and phosphorylated tau protein (T-tau and P-tau), and cholesterol and triglyceride levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in AD patients and control subjects. Results: In Mexican AD patients, we found significantly lower levels of Aβ42 (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. In contrast, significantly higher levels of P-tau (p < 0.05) and triglycerides (p < 0.05) were observed in AD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the severity of dementia and plasma P-tau levels, Aβ42/Aβ40 and P-tau/T-tau ratios, and triglycerides concentrations. This correlation increased gradually with cognitive decline.

Three hundred and thirty-six (336) Holstein-Friesian (780 ± 36 kg BW; which had lactated more than twice) were sampled by coccygeal venipuncture, 7 d before, and 7 and 14 d after parturition. For each sample and metabolite serum concentrations were stratified in thresholds and related to MY. When BHBA levels were high 7 d before parturition and were related to MY at d-7 postpartum, it was observed that 11.00 % of the cows lost 0.370 kg d-1 of milk. In contrast, no relationship was observed between BHBA prepartum and MY on d-14 of lactation. It was not observed any association between high NEFA and low Ca2+ levels prepartum and MY. NEFA concentrations ≥ 0.5 mmol L-1 on d-7 before calving were 7.6 more susceptible for lameness incidence (P≤ 0.01), and when BHBA ≥ 0.8 mmol L-1 cows were 2.4 times more likely to develop ketosis (P≤0.05) in the first 60 d in milk. In brief, data indicate that a high proportion of cows are above the thresholds of β-hydroxybutyrate and non-esterified fatty acids, and are also deficient in calcium, when determined one week before parturition.

In addition, analyses with traditional morphometrics have revealed differences in skull size among certain populations of the species. Therefore, in order to reassess the systematic and taxonomic status of P. furvus, we incorporated a suite of genetic and morphometric characters and employed cladistic analyses. Herein, we present results mostly derived from our genetic analyses (results from the phylogenetic examination of skull size and shape will appear later). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using four mitochondrial genes (Cytb and ND3-ND4L-ND4) with the respective data analyzed separately or combined, followed by an analysis with genetic and morphometric data (size and shape characters). Most phylogenetic constructions were made with parsimonious methods, but probabilistic methods also were used in the analyses with the genes separated by type. Similar topologies were recovered from all analyses of the Cytb gene and from all parsimony analyses of the NADH genes; however, conflicting topologies were obtained with the probabilistic methods for the NADH genes. Additionally, to better understand the genetic variation in each type of gene, analyses for genetic divergence were conducted within and among genetic groups and haplotype networks were constructed. All the topologies obtained using genetic data questioned the monotypic status of P. furvus, as two additional clades were identified that seemingly correspond to unrecognized entities. The first of these, P. latirostris, occurs in the northern region and could be considered as either a species or subspecies. An unknown Peromyscus species nova that occurs to the south is considered as a valid species. Further, P. furvus s. s. becomes a polytypic species by recognizing at least two subspecies (P. f. angustirostris and P. f. furvus). Phylogenetic analyses also rejected membership of P. melanocarpus and P. ochraventer within the furvus species group. Instead, P. melanocarpus showed a greater affinity to P. mexicanus totontepecus, whereas, P. ochraventer either joined to the clade containing P. melanocarpus and P. m. tototepecus or to Megadontomys cryophilus in a sister clade. Finally, Osgoodomys banderanus (subgenus Haplomylomys) always remained basally positioned and segregated from all members of the subgenus Peromyscus.";Cytochrome-b gene | Furvus species-group | Multiple-character-phylogenies | NADH genes | Peromyscus;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;143.02.046;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This can prevent different diseases such as coronary illness or cancer. Its deficiency generates neuromuscular disorders, which is why a recommended daily intake for humans of 55 μg/day has been proposed but it is not always covered. Selenium is integrated as selenoaminoacids to glutathione peroxidases, which are enzymes involved in redox reactions. Some yeast are capable of introducing inorganic selenium into the polypeptide chains of ribosome to later transform it into selenoaminoacids. In some cases, selenized yeasts are used as starter cultures in fermented foods processing. These yeasts are considered bioavailable selenium supplements and currently food science has developed strategies to include them within innovation processes of enriched products. Due to the importance of selenium in human health, the objective of this review is to present a state of the art of selenized foods, going through the importance of selenium in human health and the biochemical mechanism of biotransformation of inorganic selenium to organic species by yeasts.;Selenium | selenized yeast | selenocysteine | selenomethionine;5;0;;;;undefined;

Since its genome was sequenced, several molecular tools have been developed to study the mechanisms behind this outstanding and extraordinary ability. The complexity of its genome due to its sheer size and the disproportionate expansion of a large number of repetitive elements, may be a key factor at play during tissue remodeling and regeneration mechanisms. Transcriptomic analysis has provided information to identify candidate genes networks and pathways that might define successful or failed tissue regeneration. Nevertheless, the epigenetic machinery that may participate in this phenomenon has largely not been studied. In this review, we outline a broad overview of both genetic and epigenetic molecular processes related to regeneration in axolotl, from the macroscopic to the molecular level. We also explore the epigenetic mechanisms behind regenerative pathways, and its potential importance in future regeneration research. Altogether, understanding the genomics and global regulation in axolotl will be key for elucidating the special biology of this organism and the fantastic phenomenon that is regeneration.;Ambystoma mexicanum | Epigenetic processes | Molecular | Regeneration;3;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;284748;

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of increasing levels of CoP supplementation on milk production, milk composition, and grass dry matter intake (GDMI) by dual-purpose tropical cows. A 4 × 4 Latin square experimental design was conducted, where four multiparous dual-purpose Holstein x Cebu cows with an average live weight of 477 ± 7 kg and milk yield of 12.1 ± 2.7 kg/d were used. The cows grazed 10 h/d on a Cynodon plectostachius sward with a stocking rate of three cows/ha. All cows received 6 kg/d DM of an experimental concentrate (EC), and the treatments consisted of four supplementation levels of CoP: T1 = 0, T2 = 0.6, T3 = 0.9, and T4 = 1.2 kg DM/d, which was provided on top of the concentrate and mixed with the EC. Grass intake was determined by the n-alkanes technique. A significant difference was observed for the average total daily DM intake (p < 0.02). No significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed for milk yield, milk composition, body weight, and GDMI for all the inclusion levels of CoP. It was concluded that CoP can be included at levels of 0.6 to 0.9 kg DM/d in the diets of cows without compromising milk yield or GDMI.;By-pass protein | Coffee pulp | Coffee waste products | Cynodon plectostachius | Local feed resources | Milk composition | Polyphenols | Substitution rate | Sustainable cattle production | Tannins;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;UAEM;15-2005-0724;Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México

Particularly, the antiprotozoal activity of indazole derivatives have been recently reported. Herein, a series of 22 indazole derivatives was synthesized and studied as antiprotozoals. The 2-phenyl-2H-indazole scaffold was accessed by a one-pot procedure, which includes a combination of ultrasound synthesis under neat conditions as well as Cadogan’s cyclization. Moreover, some compounds were derivatized to have an appropriate set to provide structure-activity relationships (SAR) information. Whereas the antiprotozoal activity of six of these compounds against E. histolytica, G. intestinalis, and T. vaginalis had been previously reported, the activity of the additional 16 compounds was evaluated against these same protozoa. The biological assays revealed structural features that favor the antiprotozoal activity against the three protozoans tested, e.g., electron withdrawing groups at the 2-phenyl ring.

Globose Cactaceae show melittophily flowers that may be attractive to a shared set of pollinators, and if the flowering events are not overlapping, flower resources could be present for the pollinators through time. Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus and Neolloydia conoidea are two sympatric cactus species in the southern Chihuahuan Desert. The objective of this study is to describe and compare some reproductive characteristics of these species. Material and methods - Individuals of Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus and Neolloydia conoidea (n = 231 and 212, respectively) were marked and monitored during one year, recording for each species, the floral phenology, behaviour and morphology, flower visitors, breeding and mating systems (through pollination experiments). Key results - The flowering periods of these species do not overlap. The flowers of both species are melittophily, with the same shape, colour, and similar behaviour; both are obligate xenogamous plants. The mating system of Neolloydia conoidea is outcrossing but mixed in Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus. They share 75% of pollinators (solitary and social bees). Conclusions - The temporal blooming separation of these species could be an important factor to facilitate coexistence within the xerophyte community since they share the same set of pollinators to achieve their reproductive success.";Bees | Breeding systems | Coexistence | Mating systems | Reproductive phenology;3;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;266150;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In order to include both red and blue maize as an enzyme source in the brewing process, the effect of temperature and time germination on the diastatic power of malts was studied. The research consisted in a completely randomized three-factor experimental design where the involved factors were colour of maize (blue and red), germination temperature (15, 20, and 25 °C), and germination time (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 days). The response variables were germination percentage, acrospire length, malting yield, and diastatic power. Data was analysed through Analysis of variance and Comparison Multiple Tukey's Test. Results showed that both temperature and germination time encouraged the acrospire length, which had a negative effect on malting yield. Regarding to diastatic power, it maintained an increase from third to seventh germination day, at the three tested temperatures. Additionally, as the germination temperature increased, the diastatic power also increased. The highest diastatic power for blue and red maize malts were 39 and 42 °L, respectively, and it was reached when these malts were germinated for 7 days at 25 °C. It was concluded that, by germinating both blue and red maize under the resulting optimum conditions, the obtained malts would be capable of converting their own starch.;Blue and red maize | Diastatic power | Germination temperature | Germination time | Malting yield;0;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;635326/570375;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Sensitisation, or an enhanced response to painful stimuli, is a well-discussed phenomenon in the human medical literature, which can arise from previous injury to an area, inflammatory reactions, or previous overstimulation of the stress axes. A number of events that occur prior to arrival at, or in the slaughterhouse, may lead to presence of these factors. This includes previous on-farm pathology, injuries arising from transport and handling and lack of habituation to humans. Whilst there is limited evidence of a direct effect of these on the processes of sensitisation in animals at slaughter, by analogy with the human neurobiology literature the connection seems plausible. In this review a neurobiological approach is taken to discuss this hypothesis in the light of basic science, and extrapolations from existing literature on the slaughter of ruminants. To confirm the postulated link between events at slaughter, and processes of hypersensitisation, further dedicated study is required.;Abattoir | Animal welfare | Cattle | Halal | Kosher | Pain | River buffalo | Sensitisation | Shechita | Stunning;11;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Although the SeDeM system is a tool that enables a rational development of a product, result does not assure that an assessed material or mixture will be successful in terms of compression, hence, further research will be necessary on these features. The objective of this study was to assess and compare two grades of metformin hydrochloride elaboration: crystalline and direct compression using PXRD, the SeDeM expert system, the Heckel and Ryshkewitch-Duckworth models, as well as process control tools such as control charts and process capability indices to characterize and predict the performance of the materials in a direct compression process. The assessment identified that in spite of dealing with two different technical grades of a material with specific critical quality attributes for each one, PXRD analysis showed we dealt with the same crystalline structure, while the SeDeM system profiles obtained have very close values, and the main differences in materials were observed when subjecting them to conditions that simulate a compaction process with the Ryshkewitch-Duckworth model, in which a 46-times higher mechanical resistance was observed in the direct compression material compared with the crystalline one. The statistical control analysis revealed that only the direct compression material could be used to elaborate tablets whose weight variation was always maintained within the specification and control limits.;compactability | compressibility | Metformin hydrochloride | performance | rheological characterization | SeDeM;0;0;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;735289;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We show how the matrices are used to characterize and to construct several sets of orthogonal polynomials with respect to some linear functional on the space of polynomials. The matrices allow us to study several kinds of generalized difference and differential equations, to obtain explicit formulas for the orthogonal polynomial sequences with respect to given bases, and also to obtain formulas for the coefficients of the three-term recurrence relations. We also construct a family of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials that contains all the families in the Askey scheme and a family of basic hypergeometric q-orthogonal polynomials that contains all the families in the q-Askey scheme.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Currently, the study of the affective states (emotions) of nonhuman animals is attracting great scientific interest focused primarily on negative experiences such as pain, fear, and suffering, which animals experience in different stages of their lives or during scientific research. Studies underway today seek to establish methods of evaluation that can accurately measure pain and then develop effective treatments for it, because the techniques available up to now are not sufficiently precise. One innovative technology that has recently been incorporated into veterinary medicine for the specific purpose of studying pain in animals is called infrared thermography (IRT), a technique that works by detecting and measuring levels of thermal radiation at different points on the body’s surface with high sensitivity. Changes in IRT images are associated mainly with blood perfusion, which is modulated by the mechanisms of vasodilatation and vasoconstriction. IRT is an efficient, noninvasive method for evaluating and controlling pain, two critical aspects of animal welfare in biomedical research. The aim of the present review is to compile and analyze studies of infrared thermographic changes associated with pain in laboratory research involving animals.;Animal welfare | Animals | Pain | Thermal images | Vascular change;18;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Therefore, a trial was carried out to evaluate the effect on productive performance and blood metabolites of including methionine and choline from polyherbal mixtures in finishing lamb diets. Forty Hampshire x Suffolk lambs weighing 26.9 ± 2.8 kg were used for a 45-day experiment. The treatments were arranged as a 2x2 factorial, in which the factors were dietary supplementation with herbal methionine and choline at two levels (0% and 0.4% of dry matter (DM)). The treatments had no effects on the lambs’ productive variables (daily feed intake, average daily gain, and feed to gain ratio), carcass characteristics and lipid metabolites (P >0.05).

Also, the newborn puppy's thermoregulating capacity is deficient, and many of the physiological processes for survival depend on this capacity. Severe modifications in body temperature can lead to hypothermia in a few hours. Hence, the first 24 to 72 h of life correspond to the highest risk time, in which the newborn can course with moderate to severe hypothermia because the shivering reflexes and vasoconstriction mechanisms are not yet developed in the newborn of this species. Temperature stabilization is reached up to the 18th day of age. However, the colostrum's adequate consumption could provide a high energy supply, contributing to a fast recovery of temperature and, consequently, to a high survival rate. This review aims to analyze the factors that affect thermoregulation of the newborn puppy, the physiological and behavioral responses, as well as to discuss the influence of the colostrum as an energy source and production of heat to face hypothermia, aside from discussing recent scientific findings of infrared thermography (IRT) used to assess the thermal response of the newborn puppy to cope with hypothermia.;Cooling | Hypothermia | Neonatal care | Puppy welfare | Thermal biology | Viability;14;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Undesirable consequences of poor desensitization and/or slaughtering procedures, causing pain and suffering to animals, are also approached. These considerations are relevant as unsuitable methods can reduce consumer acceptance and commercial value of the meat obtained from animals undergoing deficient slaughtering procedures due to a lack of concern regarding their welfare. Relevant databases -Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed- were searched for this review, including keywords such as pain, slaughter, stunning, Bubalus bubalis, and animal welfare. A detailed description of river buffalo's encephalic anatomy was compared to cattle concerning correct stunning and slaughter methods. The neurobiological processes of pain felt by animals when inadequately desensitized was also examined. Finally, recent findings on stunning methods for buffaloes were discussed, including encephalography. It was concluded that different animal species may require different stunning methods; at the same, time the optimal anatomical site also varies between species. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to train the personnel performing these procedures (transport, stunning, slaughtering) to avoid mishandling that jeopardizes animal welfare by generating stimuli that trigger neurophysiological responses and, in turn, translate into pain during slaughter and reduced meat quality.";Abattoir | Buffalo welfare | Humane slaughter | Nociception | Pain | Stunning;8;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Cd is an endocrine disruptor that interferes with reproduction by causing oxidative stress in the reproductive organs, affecting the sexual function and decreasing testosterone (T) levels. However, little research has been done on the effects of Cd on puberty markers and antioxidant systems. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Cd on puberty markers: preputial separation, testes descent and T levels, and the antioxidant activity (SOD, CAT, GSH/GSSG and TAC) in the seminal vesicles, testis and epididymis.

At the end of treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the tissues of interest dissected, weighed and prepared for the respective assays. Cd treated rats from birth to puberty showed a delay onset in the puberty markers and a low weight in reproductive organs. Also, Cd induced differential effects on the redox system in reproductive organs and decreased T levels, these effects played a pivotal role in the delay of puberty markers onset (testes descent and preputial separation), affecting the development and sexual maturity of the male rats.";Antioxidant | Cadmium | Puberty | Testosterone | Toxicity;1;0;;;UAM;622536/570248;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

Hence, exposure by human populations is becoming a public health problem. With a half-life of up to 40 years, cadmium is now a topic of great interest due to its role as an endocrine disruptor and its effects on male reproduction. Cd's diverse toxic mechanisms are based on its capacity to mimic divalent ions -calcium, zinc, iron- that participate in physiological processes. It alters the mitochondrial function and generates the production of free radicals that can induce apoptosis. In male reproduction, Cd alters the precise coordination of the hypothalamic-hypophysis-testis axis (HHT), resulting in the loss of testicular functions like steroidogenesis, spermatogenesis and the onset of puberty, sexual maturity, sexual behavior and fertility. Exposure to Cd may even cause changes in the immune system that are associated with the reproductive system. This review analyses the state of the question regarding Cd's cellular and physiological mechanisms and the effects of this heavy metal on the neuroendocrine regulation of male reproduction.;Cadmium | Epididymis | Fertility | Immune system | Male Reproduction | Prostate | Review | Semen quality | Testicle;3;0;;;;undefined;

Pharmacological treatments do not reduce Aβ aggregation neither restore learning and memory. Noninvasive techniques have emerged as an alternative to treat AD, such as stimulation with electromagnetic fields (EMF) that decrease Aβ deposition and reverses cognitive impairment in AD mice, even though some studies showed side effects on parallel magnetic fields stimulation. As a new approach of magnetic field (MF) stimulation, vortex magnetic fields (VMF) have been tested inducing a random movement of charged biomolecules in cells, promoting cell viability and apparently safer than parallel magnetic fields. In this study we demonstrate the effect of VMF on Aβ aggregation. The experimental strategy includes, i) design and construction of a coil capable to induce VMF, ii) evaluation of VMF stimulation on Aβ peptide induced-fibrils-formation, iii) evaluation of VMF stimulation on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line in the presence of Aβ peptide. We demonstrated for the first time that Aβ aggregation exposed to VMF during 24 h decreased ~ 86% of Aβ fibril formation compared to control. Likewise, VMF stimulation reduced Aβ fibrils-cytotoxicity and increase SH-SY5Y cell viability. These data establish the basis for future investigation that involve VMF as inhibitor of Aβ-pathology and indicate the therapeutic potential of VMF for AD treatment.;Alzheimer’s disease | amyloid β plaques | magnetic stimulation | Rodin coil | Thioflavin-t assay;5;0;;;;undefined;

We analyze whether the current genetic structure and isolation of the two large American felids, jaguar (Panthera onca) and puma (Puma concolor), are mediated by changes in climatic suitability and connection routes over modern and paleoclimatic landscapes. We estimate species distribution under 5 climatic landscapes (modern, Holocene, last maximum glaciations [LMG], average suitability, and climatic instability) and correlate them with individuals’ genetic isolation through causal modeling on a resemblance matrix. Both species exhibit genetic isolation patterns correlated with LMG climatic suitability, suggesting that these areas may have worked as “allele refuges.” However, the jaguar showed higher vulnerability to climate changes, responding to modern climatic suitability and connection routes, whereas the puma showed a continuous and gradual transition of genetic variation. Despite differential responsiveness to climate change, both species are subjected to the climatic effects on genetic configuration, which may make them susceptible to future climatic changes, since these are progressing faster and with higher intensity than changes in the paleoclimate. Thus, the effects of climatic changes should be considered in the design of conservation strategies to ensure evolutionary and demographic processes mediated by gene flow for both species.;causal modeling | climatic landscape | ecological niche modeling | gene flow | linear mixed model;5;0;;;CAPES;88887.478136/2020‐00;Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

For environmental reasons, the materials should be non-polluting and abundant, and zinc sulfide (ZnS) meets these requirements. In this context, we synthesized ZnS thin films using the sol-gel method aiming at evaluating the effect of some zinc and sulfur precursors, complexing agents, and thermal treatment on ZnS obtention. The resulting solids were treated in an oxidizing atmosphere and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to establish the most suitable reaction protocol for ZnS preparation. Based on these results we were able to deposit ZnS coatings on glass-quartz substrates using the spin-coating technique. The films were also subjected to heat treatment based on gaseous nitrogen and elemental sulfur. ZnS coatings were characterized through XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-Ray dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and UV-Vis spectroscopy.

The study site includes primarily water bodies, riparian vegetation, willow and Montezuma cypress stands, maize fields, and grasslands. We recorded kingbird behavior twice a week along 21 transects throughout 2012 and 2015. Courtship and reproductive behaviors were displayed in autumn (Sep) and early winter (Dec). Intraspecific agonistic behaviors were associated with courtship and mating events, particularly in 2015. Cassin's Kingbird generally favored open vegetation. The main foraging strategy in open habitats was flycatching but foliage gleaning became frequent when mistletoe plants produced fruits in infested willow stands. The use of mistletoe fruits, presumably a secondary diet item, coincided with the breeding season. In addition to these observations, our study is the first report of Cassin's Kingbird winter mating at low latitudes.;behavior | courtship | foraging | kingbird | vegetation;0;0;;;CONACYT;266002;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

However, little is known of its relationship with other stress-related biomarkers, and howthe incidence of an immune challenge during longterm stress could affect an individual's overall stress response. We investigated here the relationship between basal and post-acute stress fecal cortisol metabolite (FC) with different antioxidant enzymes, oxidative damage and immune parameters in the fish-eating bat, Myotis vivesi. We found that in both basal and post-stress conditions, FC was highly related with a number of antioxidant enzymes and immune parameters, but not to oxidative damage. We also assessed changes of FC through the seasons. Basal FC samples and stress reactivity after short-duration stress displayed similar levels during summer, autumn and early winter, but lower concentrations in late winter. Stress reactivity after long-duration stress was greater in summer and early winter. Finally, we tested the effect of a simultaneous exposure to a long, strong stress stimulus with an immune response stimulation by administrating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) after 42 h. Results showed that when both stimuli were administrated, FC concentrations, inflammation and some antioxidant activity were lowered in comparison with the control and individual administration of the challenges. Our findings support the idea that animals maintain constant basal glucocorticoid levels when living in challenging environments, but response to acute stress differs seasonally and immune defense mechanisms and stress responses might be compromised when confronted with multiple challenges.;Acth | Antioxidants | Chiroptera | Cortisol | Immune response | Stress;1;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Convalescent sera of hamsters, dogs, and cows showed the presence of IgG antibodies, recognizing a recombinant version of this protein expressed in Escherichia coli (rGspDLC) in Western blot assays. In a pilot vaccination study, a group of eight hamsters was immunized on days zero and 14 with 50 µg of rGspDLC mixed with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (FIA).

More recently, in the 1970s, human placentophagia was reported in North America with a trend toward increased consumption. There are different hypotheses about the women and nonhuman mammals’ motivation towards placentophagia, but few have been subject to hypotheses testing. In women, the controversy continues; on the one hand, researchers attribute benefits like increased breast milk, weight gain in newborns, decreased postpartum depression and fatigue, and improved mothers’ mood. In contrast, bacterial or viral infections, hormonal, or trace elements that could become toxic for both the mother and baby are reported as possible health risks. Other reports argue a lack of scientific rigor to support the self-reported benefits of placentophagia. Also, the way the placenta is prepared (raw, cooked, dehydrated, processed, or encapsulated) alters its components, and thus the desired effects. This review provides relevant information and the different hypotheses and points of view around placentophagia. However, there are still questions to be resolved, and more studies are needed to confirm or reject the data generated so far about placentophagia in humans and nonhuman mammals.";Amniotic fluid | Mammals | Parturition | Placenta | Placentophagia | POEF;5;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The viability of bacteria in both products decreased by approximately 3 orders of magnitude. The death rate constant corresponded to 0.1143 for BIP-Av and 0.1466 for BIP-In, which means that in these storage conditions, the viability decreased slightly. Both products protected bifidobacteria for more than 2 yr, delivering a concentration of more than 1 × 105 cfu/g. Due to these characteristics, the products could be incorporated into solid pharmaceutical forms for oral administration.

A successful intervention to prevent this condition has been exercise-based therapy. Metformin (MTF), an anti-diabetic drug with pleiotropic effects, is known to retain redox homeostasis. However, the combined use of MTF with exercise has shown controversial experimental results. Our research group has shown that MTF-treatment does not limit the benefits provided by exercise, probably by inducing a hormetic response. Hence, our aim was to evaluate the effect of exercise in combination with MTF-treatment on the redox state of old female Wistar rats. Animals were divided into six groups; three groups preformed exercise on a treadmill for 5 days/week for 20 months and the other three were sedentary. Also, two groups of each, exercised and sedentary animals were treated with MTF for 6 or 12 months correspondingly, beside the untreated groups. Rats were euthanized at 24 months. Muscular functionality was analyzed as the relation between the lean mass free of bone with respect to the grip strength. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase content, enzymatic activity and redox state were determined in the gastrocnemius muscle.

The effect of each introgression was evaluated in the fertility of the segmental males, quantifying the amount of offspring produced. Through specific crosses method, we generated Drosophila segmental isolines carrying specific chromosomal introgression segments. The introgressions were monitored cytogenetically by the method of molecular markers of chromosomal asynapsis. The statistical analysis showed that none of the three segments evaluated, introgressed individually or in pairs, as well as cis or trans, do not produce sterility in the segmental males, as determined by the normal productions of offspring. Additional introgressions using other larger segments show that when the introgressions reach a minimum size of 31.15%, they produce sterility. It is concluded that the hybrid sterility genes present in the three segments evaluated did not act in strong epistasis, but show a pattern of gradual additive behaviour by requiring a minimum threshold size to produce sterility. Finally, we also isolated the smallest introgressing segment that has been reported for these species (2.19%), and for the first time we have managed to place it in homozygous state (data not shown), so we are now in the process of evaluating the ability to these segments in homozygous state.;chromosome introgression | Drosophila | hybrid inviability | hybrid sterility | hybridization | reproductive isolation;0;0;;;UAB;undefined;Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona

Rotifers and cladocerans are important as live prey for fish and invertebrate larval rearing. We carried out an experimental study to evaluate the effect of a commercial probiotic (NanoCrusta®) on improving population growth of Brachionus angularis, Plationus patulus, Moina cf. macrocopa and Simocephalus mixtus. The probiotic was tested by direct supplementation (2.1 × 106, 4.2 × 106, 8.5 × 106 and 1.7 × 107 cells/ml) in addition to C. vulgaris as a source of food (1 × 106 cells/ml). The results indicated that probiotics enhanced maximum population density (Dmax) and the population growth rate (r) in both zooplankton groups. At 4.2 × 106 cells/ml, B. angularis improved their Dmax (62.74%) and r (28%) compared with probiotic-free control, while P. patulus enhanced their Dmax and r by 51.26% and 20.83% (probiotic at 8.5 × 106 cells/ml). The two lowest probiotic densities resulted in an improvement in the parameters compared with the probiotic-free control treatments: M. cf. macrocopa enhanced Dmax by 14.82% and r by 18%, and S. mixtus incremented Dmax 10.92% and r by 10%.

For this purpose, agave fructans (0–3.0%) were added to several ice cream formulations to explore relationships between their sensory perception, and their previously reported thermal and texture properties. Formulations with less than 1.2% of agave fructans contributed sensory attributes linked to the amount and size of ice crystals, such as crystallized (both texture and appearance), grainy and cold sensation. These were related to frozen water, ice fraction, enthalpy and maximum temperature, as well as hardness, melting rate and compression force. On the other hand, the samples with concentrations between 1.2 and 3.0% of agave fructans showed ice cream formulations with longer melting times, smooth, creamy and fluid texture, and with fatty sensation. These properties were directly related to low non-frozen water concentrations, high glass transition temperatures and ΔCp values, as well as textural properties, such as apparent viscosity and overrun. Even though consumers liked the samples with higher amounts of fat and sugar, all the samples showed liking values in a quite narrow range around the neutral point on the liking scale. Thus, agave fructans were able to enhance several sensory, thermal and textural properties, making them a feasible alternative as a fat and sugar replacer.;Ice cream agave fructans sensory | Textural and thermal correlation;13;0;;;CONACYT;IT201220;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

To resolve some of these systematic issues along the Mexican Atlantic coast, molecular analyses of Sargassum species were carried out using DNA sequences of the COI-5P, ITS-2 and rbcL_S genetic markers. Of the 16 species recorded for the area, five species (S. acinarium, S. mathiesonii, S. pteropleuron, S. pusillum and S. ramifolium) were not found during the collections and their status remains undefined. Phylogenetic analyses of the three molecular markers showed that 10 species with their varieties (S. bermudense, S. buxifolium, S. cymosum, S. filipendula, S. fluitans, S. furcatum, S. hystrix, S. natans, S. polyceratium, and S. vulgare) were grouped into a polytomy, with low genetic diversity. If we consider these markers as suitable for proxy for species delimitation, these species should be synonymized under S. cymosum, the older name.

The spermatozoa capacitation was performed in supplemented TALP-Hepes media and mean lethal concentration values of 460.55 μM for PFOS, and 1930.60 μM for PFHxS were obtained. Results by chlortetracycline staining showed that intracellular Ca2+ patterns bound to membrane proteins were scarcely affected by PFOS. The spontaneous acrosome reaction determined by FITC-PNA was significantly reduced by PFOS and slightly increased by PFHxS. Both toxic compounds significantly alter the normal capacitation process from 30 min of exposure. An increase in ROS production was observed by flow cytometry and considerable DNA fragmentation by the comet assay. The immunocytochemistry showed a decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation in proteins of the equatorial and acrosomal zone of the spermatozoa head. In conclusion, PFOS and PFHxS have toxic effects on the sperm, causing mortality and altering vital parameters for proper sperm capacitation.;Boar spermatozoa | Perfluorinated compounds | PFHxS | PFOS | Spermatozoa toxicology;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;283833;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The Li/Ca, Na/Ca, Mn/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca and Pb/Ca ratios were measured in otolith core (juvenile stage) and edge (adult stage) (N = 131) using laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry. Several ratios were significantly different between sampling sites for core and edge (P < 0.05). For otolith edge, permutational multivariate analysis of variance showed significant differences (P < 0.05) between all sampling sites from Mexico (except between Mecoacán and Tamiahua, P > 0.05) and between Mexico (pooled samples) and Brazil. Quadratic discriminant analyses showed jackknifed classification higher in the edge (66.6% and 99.5% for Mexico and Brazil plus Mexico, respectively) than in the core (46.3% and 76.5% Mexico and Brazil plus Mexico, respectively). The two cluster analyses based on the core microchemistry (Mexico and Brazil plus Mexico) produced three main clusters, which did not coincide with catchment areas.

Bats were captured at two sites: one with wind farms and the other without. Blood and feces were collected and cortisol and corticosterone were measured by immunoassay. Glucocorticoid contents were not significantly different between sites with or without wind turbines for any of the four species, although they averaged higher at wind turbine sites. However, cortisol and corticosterone concentrations were different between the dry and rainy seasons. The elevated glucocorticoid levels during the dry season are possibly due to the high degree of physiological stress generated by their reproductive activity.

Levetiracetam (LEV) is a widely used antiepileptic drug that is also associated with the reversal of cognitive dysfunction. The long-lasting effect of LEV treatment and its participation in synaptic plasticity have not been explored in early chronic epilepsy. Therefore, through the measurement of evoked field potentials, this study aimed to comprehensively identify the alterations in the excitability and the short-term (depression/facilitation) and long-term synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP) of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in a lithium–pilocarpine rat model of TLE, as well as their possible restoration by LEV (1 week; 300 mg/kg/day). TLE increased the population spike (PS) amplitude (input/output curve); interestingly, LEV treatment partially reduced this hyperexcitability. Furthermore, TLE augmented synaptic depression, suppressed paired-pulse facilitation, and reduced PS-LTP; however, LEV did not alleviate such alterations. Conversely, the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)-LTP of TLE rats was comparable to that of control rats and was decreased by LEV. LEV caused a long-lasting attenuation of basal hyperexcitability but did not restore impaired synaptic plasticity in the early chronic phase of TLE.";Evoked field potentials | Inhibitory transmission | Levetiracetam | Synaptic plasticity | Temporal lobe epilepsy;4;1;repositoryvor;Green;LaRC;INP 064/2015;Langley Research Center

The extracts were added to final concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 µg/mL. The cultures were incubated for 72 and 48 h, respectively, at 37ºC, with 5% CO2. Extract-free cultures with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and colchicine were included as negative and positive witness, respectively. Cell proliferation was evaluated by the sulfrhodamine method. For antibacterial activity and to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), double dilutions of extracts were performed from 5-0.039 mg/mL of extracts, which were later added to cultures of Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus (5 x 106 CFU/mL) cultured with RPMI-1640 medium and resazurin sodium salt. The cultures were incubated 24 h at 37oC. The hexanic extract inhibited the proliferation of spleen cells. Dichloromethanic and methanolic extracts stimulated cell proliferation as the extract-free in bone-marrow cultures, and 1-and 10 µg/mL of dichloromethanic and aqueous extracts and 1 µg/mL of hexanic extract inhibited cell proliferation. In contrast, 1 µg/mL of the methanolic extract and 10 and 100 µg/mL of the hexanic extract stimulated cell proliferation of bone marrow (p <0.001). The remaining extracts and concentrations acted cytostatically. The lowest MIC (0.039 mg/mL) was obtained with the hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol extracts against B. subtilis and hexane and dichloromethane extracts against S. aureus (0.156 mg/mL).U. dioica showed least activity. U. urens and U. dioica produced 14 and 7 inhibitory extracts, respectively.;Antibacterial activity | Hematopoietic activity | Urtica urens;0;0;;;;undefined;

IRT is a useful tool that has been used mainly as a diagnostic method for various stress-causing pathologies, though recent suggestions indicate that it can be used to assess the block quality of certain body regions. In the field of anaesthesiology, IRT has been applied to brachial and epidural blocks, while in algology, changes in surface blood circulation associated with sympathetic activity have been investigated. Thermography has also been employed to complement pain level scales based on the facial expressions of patients in critical condition, or after surgery. In addition, it has been used as a tool in research designed to evaluate different surgical procedures in human medicine, as in the case of surgical burrs for placing dental implants, where IRT helps assess the degree of heating associated with bone devascularisation, reduction in vascular perfusion as a consequence of stroke, and changes in the autonomous nervous system, or the degree of vascular changes in flaps applied to burn patients. In veterinary medicine, thermography has brought several benefits for animals in terms of evaluating lesions, diseases, and surgical procedures. The aim of this review is to evaluate how IRT can be used as a tool in surgical procedures, cases of vascular change, and pain monitoring in veterinary medicine with an emphasis on small animals.;Algology | Microcirculation | Thermal biology | Thermographic images | Welfare;36;0;;;;undefined;

Different species of scorpions have divergent adaptations to the substrate they live in, but most of them share an intriguing characteristic: their exoskeleton contains fluorophores that emit blue-greenish fluorescence under ultraviolet radiation. Although there are some reports in the literature on the study of fluorescence in scorpions, the biological functionality of this light emission is currently unknown and is under debate. In this work, the properties of emission from the scorpion's exoskeleton are studied by means of digitally processed photographs taken of living specimens under ultraviolet illumination and complemented with standard spectroscopic measurements of emission and excitation spectra. With the aim of identifying possible correlations between the fluorescence, the characteristics color of the exoskeleton and the biology of the scorpions, 4 families, 9 genera and 24 species were studied. Our results suggest that the intensity of fluorescence is heterogeneous throughout the scorpion's exoskeleton studied here in such a way that pedipalps and metasomal segments fluoresce more intensely than the mesosomal segments. The spectrum of fluorescence across species is practically identical, suggesting that the same fluorophores are present in their exoskeletons. However, the fluorescence intensity emitted by each species varies according to their characteristic color (associated with the exoskeleton optical reflectance). Since the coloration of the exoskeleton is determined by the concentration of melanin and other pigments according to the substrate where scorpions live in, we conclude by suggesting that fluorescence may correlate directly to the ecomorphotype of the scorpions.;Exoskeleton | Fluorescence | Scorpions;4;0;;;NSF;DEB-1754587;National Science Foundation

Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains involved in signal transduction through receptors and include or recruit specific types of proteins and glycoproteins. Few studies have focused on identifying glycoproteins resident in the lipid rafts of spermatozoa. Proteins associated with lipid rafts modify their localization during capacitation. The objective of the study was to identify the glycoproteins associated with lipid rafts of capacitated boar spermatozoa through a lectin-binding assay coupled to mass spectrometry approach. From the proteomic profiles generated by the raft proteins extractions, we observed that after capacitation the intensity of some bands increased while that of others decreased. To determine whether the proteins obtained from lipid rafts are glycosylated, lectin blot assays were performed. Protein bands with a good resolution and showing significant glycosylation modifications after capacitation were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The bands of interest had an apparent molecular weight of 64, 45, 36, 34, 24, 18 and 15 kDa. We sequenced the 7 bands and 20 known or potential glycoproteins were identified. According to us, for ten of them this is the first time that their association with sperm lipid rafts is described (ADAM5, SPMI, SPACA1, Seminal plasma protein pB1, PSP-I, MFGE8, tACE, PGK2, SUCLA2, MDH1). Moreover, LYDP4, SPAM-1, HSP60, ZPBP1, AK1 were previously reported in lipid rafts of mouse and human spermatozoa but not in boar spermatozoa. We also found and confirmed the presence of ACR, ACRBP, AWN, AQN3 and PRDX5 in lipid rafts of boar spermatozoa. This paper provides an overview of the glycosylation pattern in lipid rafts of boar spermatozoa before and after capacitation. Further glycomic analysis is needed to determine the type and the variation of glycan chains of the lipid rafts glycoproteins on the surface of spermatozoa during capacitation and acrosome reaction.;Boar spermatozoa | Capacitation | Glycoprotein | Lectin | Lipid rafts;2;0;;;CONACYT;M10-A02;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

ABCA1 variants have been shown to be associated to these conditions. We sought to test the combined effect of two ABCA1 gene common variants, rs2422493 (− 565C > T) and rs9282541 (R230C) on HDL-c levels and T2D risk. Methods: Path analysis was conducted in 3,303 Mexican-mestizos to assess the specific contributions of rs2422493 and rs9282541 ABCA1 variants, insulin resistance, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and age on HDL-c levels and T2D risk. Participants were classified into four groups according to their ABCA1 variants carrier status: (i) the reference group carried wild type alleles for both ABCA1 variants (−/−), (ii) +/– were carriers of rs2422493 but non-carriers of rs9282541, (iii) −/+ for carriers of rs9282541 but not carriers of rs2422493 and (iv) carriers of minor alleles for both SNPs (+/+). Principal components from two previous genome-wide association studies were used to control for ethnicity. Results: We identified significant indirect effects on T2D risk mediated by HDL-c in groups −/+ and +/+ (β = 0.04; p = 0.03 and β = 0.06; p < 0.01, respectively) in comparison to the −/− reference group. Low concentrations of HDL-c were directly and significantly associated with increased T2D risk (β = −0.70; p < 0.01). WHtR, male gender, age, and insulin resistance were also associated with T2D risk (p < 0.05). There was no significant direct effect for any of the ABCA1 groups on T2D risk: p = 0.99, p = 0.58, and p = 0.91 for groups +/–, −/+, and +/+ respectively. Conclusions: The ABCA1 rs9282541 (R230C) allele is associated with T2D in Mexicans through its effect on lowering HDL-c levels. This is the first report demonstrating that HDL-c levels act as an intermediate factor between an ABCA1 variant and T2D.";ABCA1 | HDL | HDL-c | Hypoalphalipoproteinemia | rs2422493 | rs9282541 | Type 2 diabetes;5;0;;;CONACYT;128877;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Six pigmented corn and barley beers were brewed and then analysed to obtain their sensory characteristics, volatile composition and non-volatile (alcohol, bitterness, anthocyanins and polyphenol content) composition. ANOVAs, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) were used to visualise these data for exploring the differences between beers based on the type of malt and to characterise corn beers considering the relationships between their sensory characteristics and their chemical parameters. The sensory attributes such as fermented fruits, cooked vegetables, tortillas, bread, dried fruits and dried chili characterised beers made 100% with pigmented corn. Over 100 volatiles were identified by head space-solid phase micro-extraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). Among them, phenols and terpenes were the groups of volatiles that better characterised beers containing corn. The content of anthocyanins in corn beers provide the 'amber-red-cooper' colours in beers and may prevent the development of off-aromas and tastes. The use of pigmented corn seems to be a good option to renew the traditional 'Sendechó' while preserving some of its sensory attributes.Â;Anthocyanins | Gc-ms | Hs-spme | SendechÃ | Sensory profile | Volatiles | Zea mays;14;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Rehabilitation (RB) is currently the only accepted treatment, although its beneficial effect is limited. The development of biomaterials has provided therapeutic possibilities for TSCI, where our research group previously showed that the plasma-synthesized polypyrrole/iodine (PPy/I), a biopolymer with different physicochemical characteristics than those of the PPy synthesized by conventional methods, promotes recovery of motor function after TSCI. The present study evaluated if the plasma-synthesized PPy/I applied in combination with RB could increase its beneficial effects and the mechanisms involved. Adult rats with TSCI were divided into no treatment (control); biopolymer (PPy/I); mixed RB by swimming and enriched environment (SW/EE); and combined treatment (PPy/I + SW/EE) groups. Eight weeks after TSCI, the general health of the animals that received any of the treatments was better than the control animals. Functional recovery evaluated by two scales was better and was achieved in less time with the PPy/I + SW/EE combination. All treatments significantly increased βIII-tubulin (nerve plasticity) expression, but only PPy/I increased GAP-43 (nerve regeneration) and MBP (myelination) expression when were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression of GFAP (glial scar) decreased in treated groups when determined by histochemistry, while morphometric analysis showed that tissue was better preserved when PPy/I and PPy/I + SW/EE were administered. The application of PPy/I + SW/EE, promotes the preservation of nervous tissue, and the expression of molecules related to plasticity as βIII-tubulin, reduces the glial scar, improves general health and allows the recovery of motor function after TSCI.

The results showed that the MpD, MpF4, and MpFphy treatments modulated the concentration of these proteins. Specifically, MpFphy at 1.0 mg/kg increased IL-4 and IL-10 and decreased IL-17, IL-1β, and TNF-α. GC-MS analysis showed that MpF4 contained a mixture of a total of nine compounds, three of them newly reported for the species.

The literature describes a high incidence of dystocia in buffalo herds as a cause of significant mortality in neonates. Therefore, understanding the physiology, behavior, and signals of calving in buffalo dams during eutocic and dystocic births will allow the development of accurate responses for the health of dams and the welfare of newborns. This review thus discusses the 3 phases of calving (onset of labor, calf expulsion, and removal of fetal membranes) and their reproductive complications. Sources: The search engines CAB Abstracts, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus were used for the following search terms: buffalo, stillbirth, parity difficulties, parturition, calving, postpartum, reproductive problems, delivery, dystocia, and uterine torsion. Synthesis: Dystocia caused by uterine torsion is common in buffalo dams, as are prepartum vaginal prolapse and placental retention. The study cites the higher incidence of clinical and subclinical uterine infection in buffaloes compared with cattle, associated only with a high number of bacteria, or combined with cases of toxic puerperal metritis that affect fertility and cause economic losses. Several studies coincide in citing high rates of stillbirths in buffaloes associated with reproductive factors that result in significant financial losses. Conclusions and Applications: Accurate predictions of the onset of calving are critical for the welfare of both dams and calves, as well as for farm economics, because it can ensure the timely provision of necessary interventions. The strategies to modify, or improve, handling and reproduction methods in buffaloes are the focus of several studies.;buffalo welfare | calving | parity difficulties | reproductive problems | stillbirth;12;0;;;;undefined;

They also have different geometries: linear, obtuse, rectangular and equilateral. We identify that some of these molecules exhibit liquid–vapour equilibria while others do not. For all of them, we show the morphological phase diagram built up from the different supra-molecular structures formed by each type of trimer. We simulated 14 different systems with a total of 321 states. The main features of the supra-molecular structures depend only on the composition and geometry of the trimer: triple SW trimers do not form supra-structures, double SW trimers and single SW trimers form monolayers, bilayers and worm-like micelles. The liquid–vapour coexistence properties are also exhibited. These trimers can be used to model complex amphiphiles beyond the standard ones, such as the Gemini and the Bola surfactants as well as colloidal particles.;monolayers | morphological phase diagrams | Self-assembly | square well trimers | supra-molecular structures;1;0;;;;undefined;

The increase in nutrients has created multiple consequences on marine ecosystems, such as harmful algal blooms, zones of hypoxia or anoxia, and loss of biodiversity. The coastal areas of México are no exception. In the scientific community, there has been a great effort to estimate the amount of nutrients that enter marine ecosystems. However, a rapid method to make this estimation without field data is still required. In this study, the cultivated area and the entrance of nutrients to the coastal marine environment were determined for one of the main irrigation districts located in the state of Sonora, which drains into the Gulf of California, Mexico. We used an elevation model combined with the digitization of drain canal maps to delimitate sub-basins and allocate the coastal runoff entry points. Landsat 8 satellite data were classified and validated for the period of two agrarian cycles (2015–2016) to obtain the agriculture parcels by sub-basins. The quantity of the nutrient runoff was estimated using the cultivation area and nitrogen runoff percentage, according to values found in published reports. As a result, we identified eight sub-basins, two of which stand out for the amount of nitrogen that drains both into a coastal lagoon and directly to the sea. We confirmed this information by correlation analysis using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm Kd(490) detected around the coastal runoff entry points. We concluded that there is a high input in the coastal zones and lagoons of nutrients and other pollutants from the agricultural zones of the Río Mayo irrigation district. We also concluded that the performance of the method applied to estimate the volume of the nitrogen runoff is useful, rapid, and can be improved with in situ data.;agricultural runoff | eutrophication | Gulf of California | Landsat 8 | nitrogen runoff | nutrient estimation;5;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACYT;251919;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The objective of this project was to assess the effects of pectin-derived oligosaccharins solution (Pectimorf®) on the postharvest vase quality of lisianthus cut flowers. Six vase-solution treatments were tested using four different Pectimorf® and sucrose mixtures, one commercial vase product, and only water (control) during the entire storage period (16 days) at room temperature. Results suggest that using Pectimorf® floral stem weight increased (20% greater than control), as did quality and leaf turgidity (>commercial limit); bent neck or pedicel curvature decreased (<20°), and antioxidant enzyme activities, phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity were modified. Furthermore, Pectimorf® reduced the growth of microorganisms in the vase solutions (>98.5%) compared to control and sucrose treatment. The vase life of the lisianthus cut flowers lasted 8 days while maintaining good visual quality. Thus, the pectin-derived oligosaccharins can be used as a supplement in vase solutions to maintain the quality and postharvest vase life of lisianthus cut flowers.

Salvia is the largest genus in the Lamiaceae family that contains more than 900 species and is widely distributed throughout most of the world, although its members are most numerous in the Americas. These plants are shrubs or perennial or annual herbs that are often strongly aromatic. Most Salvia species are economically important for their essential oil content or medicinal and ornamental value; several species have been used to treat microbial diseases, cancer, malaria and inflammation, and they also have antioxidant and insecticide properties. Drug-resistant pathogens are one of the most serious problems in the treatment of microbial diseases, and the search for new antimicrobial agents is very important. Different investigations have found that the essential oils (EOs) obtained from different plants have excellent antimicrobial activity. Therefore, there is interest in knowing the composition of EOs and correlating their composition with their biological activity, which has aroused great interest. The purpose of this review is to present the results of the last nine years and to provide an overview of the published data on essential oils obtained from 32 Salvia species with antimicrobial activity.";Antimicrobial activity | Essential oil | Salvia genus;0;0;;;;undefined;

Anthelmintics cause resistance, contamination, and a risk of public health. Prosopis laevigata is a plant used as a home remedy against many diseases in Mexico. This study arose from a preliminary study where a P. laevigata hydroalcoholic extract (Pl-hae) showed anthelmintic activity (aa) against H. contortus. Searching for bioactive compounds (bac) with high aa, the Pl-hae was fractioned obtaining an aqueous (Aq-F) and an ethyl acetate fraction (EtAc-F), and a flavonoid with aa identified as isorhamnetin was obtained from EtAc-F. Both fractions were in vitro assessed by the egg hatch test (eht) and larval mortality (lm) assays. The bac obtained from EtAc-F were characterised by NMR analysis. The highest aa were recorded with EtAc-F, resulting in 100% eht and 80.45% lm at 0.75 and 30 mg/mL, respectively. Alterations in eggs and larvae attributed to isorhamnetin were recorded by environmental scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning and by high-resolution digital-coupled camera. This flavonoid caused 100% eht at 0.07 mg/mL after 48 h and 100% lm at 7.5 mg/mL after 72 h exposure.

Here, we show geospatial estimates of overweight and wasting prevalence among children under 5 years of age in 105 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) from 2000 to 2017 and aggregate these to policy-relevant administrative units. Wasting decreased overall across LMICs between 2000 and 2017, from 8.4% (62.3 (55.1–70.8) million) to 6.4% (58.3 (47.6–70.7) million), but is predicted to remain above the World Health Organization’s Global Nutrition Target of <5% in over half of LMICs by 2025. Prevalence of overweight increased from 5.2% (30 (22.8–38.5) million) in 2000 to 6.0% (55.5 (44.8–67.9) million) children aged under 5 years in 2017. Areas most affected by double burden of malnutrition were located in Indonesia, Thailand, southeastern China, Botswana, Cameroon and central Nigeria.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor c-Met represent one of the main systems for liver repair damage and defense against hepatotoxic factors, leading to an antioxidant and repair response. In this study, we evaluated the capability of HGF to counteract the damage caused by the model cholestatic agent, α-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT). HGF had clear anti-cholestatic effects, as apparent from the improvement in both bile flow and liver function test. Histology examination revealed a significant reduction of injured areas. HGF also preserved the tight-junctional structure. These anticholestatic effects were associated with the induction of basolateral efflux ABC transporters, which facilitates extrusion of toxic biliary compounds and its further alternative depuration via urine. The biliary epithelium seems to have been also preserved, as suggested by normalization in serum GGT levels, CFTR expression and cholangyocyte primary cilium structure our results clearly show for the first time that HGF protects the liver from a cholestatic injury.";ANIT | Cholestasis | HGF | Liver | Oxidative stress;9;0;;;CONICET;PICT-2016-1613;Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas

This study characterized the digestibility of three octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modified starches extracted from three Musaceae; namely, FHIA 21, Dominico Hartón (DH) and Gros Michel (GM). The starches were subjected to in vitro digestion. The FHIA and GM starch samples presented the highest (14.42%) and lowest (0.78%) contents of rapidly digestible starch, respectively. On the other hand, the DH and FHIA starch samples presented the highest (86.42%) and lowest (55.72%) contents of slowly digestible starch, respectively. It was found that the slowly digestible starch content is correlated (ρ = 0.92) with the degree of substitution (1.92 for DH and 1.01 for FHIA) of the OSA-modified starch samples. This shows that OSA modification is a reliable approach for obtaining starches with reduced digestibility and low glycemic index.";Digestibility | Modified starch | Musaceae | Resistant starch;11;0;;;;undefined;

Due to the complex nature of the factors involved in the process of parturition, it may be difficult to distinguish between eutocia (normal delivery) and dystocia (difficult birth). It is essential to do so because the physiopathological effects of problematic labour often deteriorate the dam's fertility and, in severe cases, may cause her death as a result of damage to the genital apparatus and the secondary development of systemic infections. Also, if parturition is not successful, neonates could suffer prolonged episodes of hypoxia, which represents a leading cause of foetal death in cases of dystocia and, even when not fatal, can be a determining factor in neonatal survival. Given this, a better knowledge of the aetiology and physiopathology of dystocia will be keys to understanding this condition and adequate decision making in obstetrical practice and veterinary perinatology. Moreover, such knowledge will permit the timely identification of cases that require special attention and establishing actions to protect animal welfare and assess risks that, on occasion, will entail pharmacological control of eutocia or dystocia. Hence, this paper aims to review some of the most critical aspects involved in the process of difficult deliveries and their consequences for the dam and the foetuses of domestic animals.;Asphyxia | Dam welfare | Domestic animals | Dystocia | Foetus | Hypoxia | Pain;10;0;;;;undefined;

Methods: Clinical ocular microbial isolates and female BALB/c mice were used to develop the murine model. Immunosuppression was achieved with cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone. A corneoscleral lesion was performed with a micro-pocket technique. Mice received an inoculum with a concentration of 1 × 105 conidia of F. falciforme and S. aureus with 1 × 105 UFC/ml. Mice were sacrificed at 72 h after induction of infection, the right eye was enucleated and preserved in 10% formaldehyde to perform the PAS staining. In addition, cuts were obtained for the labeling with the fluorophores propidium iodide and Calcofluor White, and other eye cuts were processed to transmission microscopy. Results: F. falciforme and S. aureus were able to developed mono and mixed biofilm in vitro. Keratitis of F. falciforme, S. aureus and mixed, were established at immunosuppressed mice. Clinical symptoms were observed at murine cornea. Histological analysis by special stains identified bacterial, fungal and mixed biofilm structures at epithelial and stromal level. Extracellular matrix was observed surrounded clusters of bacterial, fungi and mixed by fluorescence and transmission electronic microscopy.

Nevertheless, this information is relevant after intense ground motions to assess the possibility of re-occupying a building. This paper develops simple expressions to estimate the maximum displacement demand from the residual displacement of single-degree-of-freedom systems subjected to long-duration narrow-banded ground motions generated in soft soil sites (particularly, those located in Mexico City). To overcome the limited scope of previous studies, more than 35,000 seismic simulations were performed. The influence of the lateral strength of the single-degree-of-freedom systems is considered.

This study considers only ABS discontinuous sounds, known as crackles, and includes fine and coarse types for both inspiratory and expiratory phases. Additionally, we develop a novel proposal to automated characterization of the IC associated with crackles. We analyzed the efficiency of three independent component analysis algorithms, i.e. FastICA, Infomax and TDSEP, through the Amari index, the signal to interference ratio, and the total relative distortion index. In the simulated multichannel signal scenarios, the performance indexes showed that Infomax is the best algorithm to solve the problem of blind source separation, supporting the results found in previous efforts. Finally, the presence of crackles in the IC obtained by Infomax was determined through their kurtosis and skewness, whereas the type of crackle was found by their characterization via the spectrogram of selected IC. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is able to adequately extract the crackle sources and identify the respiratory cycle phase in which they appear. Also, we managed to estimate the type and number of existing crackles in each source. In conclusion, our methodology can provide quantitative information on the clinical relevance of crackles in respiratory patients.;Blind source separation | Crackles | Kurtosis | Skewness | Spectrogram;3;0;;;;undefined;

This study evaluated the anxiolytic-like effect of a single oral dose of a hydroethanolic extract of C. incisum and two of its main constituents, pinostrobin and stigmasterol, in the elevated plus maze and hole-board test in mice. The nonspecific effects of the drugs on the ambulatory activity of mice were evaluated in the open field test. The acute toxicity of the extract was determined, and the extract composition was analyzed. The extract at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, as well as pinostrobin and stigmasterol (1 to 30 mg/kg), induced anxiolytic-like effects in both the elevated plus maze and in the hole-board tests, significantly increasing the exploratory behaviors. The anxiolytic actions of drugs were not associated with changes in the ambulatory activity of animals. No evidence of toxicity was observed in the animals treated with hydroethanolic extract of C. incisum. The mean lethal dose was higher than 2000 mg/kg. Chenopodium incisum elicited anxiolytic effects in mice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the anxiolytic effect of pinostrobin. Our results suggest that C. incisum is beneficial to patients with mood disorders.

Markov models of single channels were first developed based on the analysis of electrophysiological data. Monte Carlo simulations of voltage-clamp experiments were performed in an iteratively optimization procedure to estimate the number of channels required to reproduce the main characteristics of the macroscopic currents recorded experimentally. A membrane model of the firing of action potentials was then developed based on the kinetic schemes of single channels and the number of channels estimated. We showed that macroscopic currents of human δ-cells can be reproduced by minimal models of single channels when the appropriate number of channels is considered. In addition, our simulations suggest that human δ-cells are capable of generating action potentials through the interaction of the ionic currents involved. Finally, we determined the relative contribution of the currents underlying the firing of action potentials in human pancreatic δ-cells, which allowed us to propose a qualitative model of an action potential in terms of the underlying ionic currents.;electrical activity | human | mathematical model | pancreatic δ-cells;3;0;;;CONACYT;CVU 302514;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Data were obtained in 2012 from a shrimp breeding population in Mexico using 12,440 shrimp for BW and 16,814 shrimp for SU, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction determinations from 160 full-sib families were obtained for VLln. DNA was extracted from pooled muscle samples of six shrimp per family for a total of 960 individuals. Heritability estimates for BW, SU, and VLln at the family mean and at individual levels were 0.24 ± 0.08, 0.02 ± 0.01, 0.42 ± 0.45, and 0.08 ± 0.11, respectively. Genetic correlation estimates of BW with SU, BW with VLln, and VLln with SU were 0.40, −0.04, and −0.57, respectively. Our results suggest that VLln has genetic variation and a favorable genetic association with BW and SU. No serious drawbacks were found from selection responses estimated using single-trait and multitrait indices to increase BW and SU and decrease VLln. Favorable correlated responses for IHHNV tolerance estimated as BW/VLln and SU/VLln were also found.

There are differences in the susceptibility to and severity of DF in studied populations. The objective of the present study was to determine if single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the genes Amelogenin (AMELX), Odontogenic Ameloblast Associated (ODAM) and Matrix Metalloproteinase 20 (MMP20) are associated with DF by evaluating the relationship between variations in these genes and the degree of DF severity. Subjects and methods: Schoolchildren from two regions of Durango State and Mexico City, Mexico, were studied. The DF phenotype was determined using the Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) index. DNA was obtained from the buccal mucosa of each participant, and the presence of the variations rs946252 in AMELX, rs1514392 in ODAM and rs1784418 in MMP20 was determined by bidirectional DNA sequencing. Results: A total of 180 DNA samples from 30 schoolchildren from 2 areas of Durango State were sequenced and analyzed. Differences in the severity of DF were found between the study areas (p = 0.006). SNVs in theMMP20 gene were present in 76.9 % of the participants in the high fluoride concentration and lower DF severity area. Conclusion: AMELX and ODAM variations was not different between the two populations with respect to DF severity; however, the presence of rs1784418 differed between phenotypes with regard to susceptibility to DF. Therefore, MMP20 might be related to the various phenotypes of DF and may serve as a protective marker.";Enamel development | Fluor | Genetics | Schoolchildren | SNV | TF index;5;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Our findings revealed that Cd can promote the activation of metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP3, MMP9 y MMP13), affecting the expression of COL2A1 and ACAN, and decreasing the presence of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans through an inflammatory response related to IL-1β y a IL-6, as well as oxidative by producing ROS like O2−• and H2O2.

Islas Marias Archipelago is considered a connectivity node among coral communities distributed along the Northeastern Tropical Pacific (NTP); as such, sexual reproduction of scleractinian corals affects the maintenance of the local populations and the long-distance connectivity of reefs across the region. In this study, successful sexual reproduction in the species of the three most abundant scleractinian corals genera was demonstrated, in part by documenting gamete presence and maturation in tissues and spatio-temporal variability in juvenile coral settlement, which were quantified across substrate type, habitat quality, and environmental factors. Only 12 larvae recruited (ten Porites, two Pavona) to artificial substrates, and monthly recruitment density of 1.82 ± 0.23 recruits m−2 (n = 383) was recorded on natural substrates. There were significant differences between genera, with Porites producing the highest density of recruits (0.60 ± 0.45 recruits m−2, followed by Pavona (0.52 ± 0.24 recruits m−2) and Pocillopora (0.28 ± 0.06 recruits m−2). The highest coral recruitment was observed at Baby Reef (2.57 ± 0.46 recruits m−2), followed by Cleofas II (1.81 ± 0.21 recruits m−2) and Japanese Garden (1.24 ± 0.46 recruits m−2); the former site was characterized by the highest cover of crustose coralline algae.

The purpose of this study was to understand the mechanisms underlying tooth movement acceleration by measuring alterations in a panel of intercellular signalling molecules and markers of osteoblast/osteoclast function following micro-pulse vibration for 20 min at 30 Hz. Design: Primary BALB/c mouse calvarial osteoblasts were cultivatedin vitro and subjected to micro-pulse vibration (0.25 N; 30 Hz) with the AcceleDent® Aura appliance for 20 min and assayed for IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, OPG, soluble RANKL and TGF-β protein by ELISA; for PCNA in osteoblasts and caspase 3/7 in osteoclasts by immunohistochemistry; for IL-4, IL-13, and Il-17 in osteoclasts by ELISA; and for cathepsin K by flow cytometry. Results: After micro-pulse vibration, the murine osteoblast culture supernatant showed increased IL-4, IL-13, IL-17, OPG and TGF-β levels and decreased RANKL levels; PCNA in osteoblasts and caspase 3/7 in osteoclasts were also upregulated. The osteoclast culture supernatant had increased levels of IL-4, IL-13 and IL-17, and cathepsin K was upregulated in the treatment group compared with the control group. Conclusions: Micro-pulse vibration promotes the production of soluble factors that inhibit osteoclasts, promote apoptosis and activate osteoblasts in vitro, which could increase bone mineral density.

The application of any reproductive technology to farm animals implies handling and often sorting and restraining. These practices should be conducted quietly in order to prevent excitement and fright and keep the animals calm. In addition, the removal of the animal from the herd (generally temporary for females and permanent for males) and the consequent social isolation may also impair animal welfare. Most of the reproductive technologies (e.g., estrus detection) show a mild effect on the animals and in several cases, habituation may occur. Conversely, other technologies may have marked direct detrimental effects (e.g., pain induced by electroejaculation) and/or indirectly induce negative emotional states (e.g., through restraining and isolation). However, some technologies have been developed with the primary aim of increasing animal welfare, as directly linked to farm profits. In particular, uterus and fetal monitoring by allowing the prediction of calving may also allow a prompt intervention in case of dystocia. Nevertheless, also in these cases preventive measures, such as the application of appropriate breeding programs including calving ease to reduce the incidence of dystocia and cesarean sections, should be preferred for an effective improvement of animal welfare.;Animal welfare | handling | reproductive technologies;3;0;;;;undefined;

Due to their capacity for structural and functional adjustment, they have had a growing interest in chemistry and related areas in the last decade. MOFs have found a promising niche in photocatalysis, because of their excellent tunable structure and optical properties. Even though their applications in photocatalysis are in a childhood stage, but in the last five years, they have shown an exponential increase in the number of publications, very close to that in heterogeneous catalysis. Their applications in photocatalysis can be grouped into three categories: energy (hydrogen production, CO2 conversion), environment (degradation of organic/inorganic pollutants), and organic synthesis. This chapter reviews recent investigations in the synthesis of MOFs pristine and their modifications and the impact they have had when applied in the photocatalytic reactions mentioned above. Following a brief introduction on the fundamentals of MOFs and their applications, the synthesized new MOFs were classified according to the metal cluster belonging to groups 4, 8 and 9–12 of the periodic table. Subsequently, MOFs-composites including metals, semiconductors, and multicomponent were analyzed in terms of preparation methods, properties, and reaction mechanisms involved in the selected photocatalytic reactions.;light-driven applications | MOFs | MOFs-composites | PCP | photocatalysis;1;0;;;;undefined;

Previous studies have reported the relationship between the use of nutritional supplements with gym attendees' sociodemographic characteristics, experience, and training goals, but not with indicators of body image selfperception. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 1,135 Mexican adults aged 18 to 40 years. Exercise, nutritional, and supplementation habits were investigated. Using Poisson regression models, the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, exercise, and self-perceived body image with the use of NS was analyzed. Results: 58.0% of the participants were men, 46.2% had consumed a NS and 35.4% currently used them. The most consumed NS were sports drinks (28.7%) and protein (23.6%). Supplement consumption was higher in men, in older participants, in those who have trained during more time, and those with functional impairment caused by training habits. Nutritionists were the third source to recommend NS, after coaches and friends. Conclusions: Almost half of the gym attendees have consumed some NS. There are groups that are more likely to consume NS, which may require further investigation regarding the reasons that explain this situation.;Athletic Performance | Body Dissatisfaction | Body Image | Dietary Supplements | Exercise, Mexico;2;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

We propose the use of well-known tissular techniques to measure the components of vulnerability. Immunohistochemistry and histopathology indicate the health status of living organisms and the environment. Therefore, these techniques should provide the necessary information to determine the vulnerability of an organism. Immunohistochemical analysis uses biomarkers to determine the presence of toxic compounds, reflecting the exposure level of an organism. Histopathological analysis reveals the environmental impact of a given toxin, reflecting the sensitivity level of the organism to said toxin. Here, we propose a strategy to use these techniques to assess the vulnerability of clams from Tecolutla, Veracruz. We developed categories for each vulnerability component using semi-quantitative scales. Briefly, we calculated the exposure level based on the average number of positive immunohistochemical biomarkers among several organs of clams. Then, we compared the prevalence of histological alterations with the exposure level to determine the sensitivity level. Finally, to estimate the recovery capacity, we placed the control group in a clean environment for 40 days. These led us to observe the capacity of the clams to reverse the effects of environmental stress. Clams showed a moderate level of exposure, a low sensitivity level, and an effective recovery capacity. In conclusion, these results indicate that clams have a low level of vulnerability. This proposal has the potential to guide future works assessing the vulnerability of organisms and later include them in the estimation of vulnerability from aquatic bodies.;Environmental stress | Histopathological index | Immunohistochemistry | Polymesoda caroliniana | Vulnerability;0;0;;;CONACYT;470845;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

There are few records of the anatomy of Selene Lacépéde, 1802. The objective was to determine the relationship between the compressed shape of the body of S. vomer and the organization of the organs within the visceral cavity. By means of a dissection, the skeletal boundaries of the visceral cavity were exposed, and the anatomy of the organs contained in it were analyzed, described, and illustrated. The visceral cavity is laterally flattened, with a trapezoidal lateral aspect, vertical, and extraviscerally extended by means of the secondary visceral cavities. The gas bladder is wide and formed by a single chamber, and it develops two posterior lobes towards the back. The mesonephros is compressed and curved, and it develops two anterior renal lobes. The digestive tube is arranged vertically and shows a set of branched duodenal caeca. The gonads have a diagonal position. A direct relationship between the lateral flattening of the body with the compressed shape of the visceral cavity and its organs is recognized. The shape of the visceral cavity is related to the vertical lengthening of the scapular and pelvic girdles, the pleural ribs, and the first anal pterygiophore. The organ with the highest number of special anatomical features is the gas bladder, due to its extravisceral posterior lobes and its attachment to the vertebral column by means of ligaments.;Duodenal caeca | Gas bladder | Moonfish | Secondary visceral cavities | Splanchnology;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

However, botanical exploration in the state has been scant and biased to certain regions, remaining great part of the territory undocumented. Questions: How many species of angiosperm epiphytes are in Puebla? How are distributed in the elevation range and by vegetation type? Studied species: The angiosperm epiphytes. Study site and dates: Data and specimens of angiosperm epiphytes from Puebla were compiled and examined from 2011 to 2019. Field work was performed in the state from 2012 to 2013. Methods: Literature was reviewed, databases were consulted, material from the collections AMO, ENCB, FCME, HUAP, MEXU, UAMIZ, XAL was examined and field work was made. Results: 18 families, 92 genera and 265 species of angiosperm epiphytes are reported for Puebla, 72 of these are endemic from Mexico. Seven species are recorded by first time for the state. The highest percentage of epiphytes is recorded in the cloud forest (50 %), followed by the Quercus forest (32 %); the largest number of species is reported at the elevation range between 1,090 to 1,700 m. Conclusions: Puebla has high diversity of angiosperm epiphytes; despite the vegetation is being fragmented, still there are favorable areas for development of epiphytes. It is important to explore and preserve those areas, before its biodiversity get lost without being documented.";Bromeliaceae | Checklist | Cloud forest | Floristics | Orchidaceae;2;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Little research has been done to test or validate methods evolved in cattle-ranching to these other species. Hence, expanding our understanding of appropriate, speciesspecific methods of weaning could support the development of approaches or strategies that have the potential to improve animal welfare and productive performance in temperate or tropical climes. This review focuses on traditional and current weaning strategies in an attempt to improve productivity and animal welfare for water buffaloes and zebus. For the case of the water buffalo, it examines common, routine weaning techniques and procedures as well as novel approaches, while for the zebu it discusses abrupt versus gradual and early versus late weaning as strategies and routines usually employed during this process. Finally, it analyses how new weaning techniques may reduce stress while enhancing productivity at the same time. These approaches include fence-line weaning, nose-flaps (plastic devices that prevent the calf from grabbing a teat to suckle), restricted suckling and a section on practical tips to decrease the stress induced by weaning in zebus. A better understanding of certain weaning techniques could, therefore, benefit calf welfare while simultaneously increasing cows' reproductive performance. Unfortunately, data on such approaches is scant, so despite published findings, several key issues remain unsolved living room for additional studies.;Buffalo welfare | Fence-line weaning | Nose-flaps | Restricted suckling | Weaning stress | Zebu welfare;3;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The objective of this study was to characterize the SFSs in the Oaxacan Mixteca, Mexico, and the highlands of Guatemala based on typologies, to know their diversity and to have elements to provide guidelines to generate development alternatives. The typology was constructed with information obtained from workshops, surveys and multivariate methods (PCA, cluster analysis and K-means). The variables that determined the diversity of the SFSs were investment capacity, remittances, type of work and livestock activities. The types of SFS identified in the Oaxacan Mixteca were: 1) farming, 2) dependent on external agricultural labours and low monetary income, 3) dependent on government programs, 4) with high non-agricultural income, and 5) medium external income. In the highlands of Guatemala: 1) semi-commercial farming, 2) commercial agriculture, 3) small subsistence, 4) small diversified income, and 5) semi-commercial agriculture. In the Oaxacan Mixteca region, the SFSs are self-consumption systems, dependent on external income (remittances and government programs), in which the potential for development lies in policies, according to the diversity of types and more efficient production systems. In Guatemala, the characteristics of the SFSs comply with global market chains, which regulate production and commercialization conditions, in which the potential for change lies in generating fairer market conditions and more efficient production systems linked to local non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

OBJECTIVES: In this study we searched for breast cancer-associated auto-antibodies against individual TAAs. Also we evaluated if a panel of multiple TTAs would improve the detection of auto-antibodies. We screened CEA, CCBN1, c-Myc, p53, Ki-67, Nm23, PRDX6, eIF5A, PARK7, GLIO-1, Hsp27 and Hsp70 proteins, previously detected as up-regulated in breast tumors of Mexican patients. METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed to detect auto-antibodies in sera from a cohort of 104 breast cancer patients and 50 sera from healthy individuals. RESULTS: Our data showed that antibodies frequency to any individual TAA was low and ranged from 0.96% to 4.8%. However, the successive addition of multiple TAAs represented by panels of three-to-five TAAs resulted in increased ELISA positive reactions. The first panel of three combined TAAs (p53/PRDX6/CEA) had a sensitivity of 19%, while a second set of four TAAs (p53/PRDX6/c-Myc/Hsp70) reached 28% sensitivity. Likewise, a third panel of five antigens (p53/PRDX6/c-Myc/Hsp70/Nm23) showed 34% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that detection of individual autoantibodies against TAAs in the cohort of patients analyzed here was low, which was enhanced by adding multiple TAAs. Data support the notion that frequencies of autoantibodies could be impacted by geographical and heterogeneous genetic factors of breast cancer patients.;autoantibodies | Breast cancer | immunodiagnosis | tumor-associated antigens;7;0;;;CONACYT;341800;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Over 100 associated loci have been identified but few reports have evaluated the population attributable fraction captured by them in population-based nationwide surveys. Therefore, we determined the population contribution of a set of known genetic risk variants to the development of dyslipidemias and T2D in Mexico. This study included 1665 participants from a Mexican National Health Survey carried out in the year 2000. It is a probabilistic complex sample survey of households, which comprises representative data at a national level. 103 previously reported SNPs associated with different dyslipidemias or T2D were genotyped and used to compute polygenic risk scores. We found that the previously known variants associated with dyslipidemias explain at most 7% of the total risk variance of lipid levels. In contrast, the known genetic risk component for T2D explained a negligible amount of variance (0.1%). Notably, variants derived from the Native-American ancestry have the strongest effect and contribute with a high proportion of the variance. These results support the need for additional studies aimed to identify specific genetic risk variants for Mexican population.;Cholesterol | Dyslipidemias | Genetics | HDL | LDL | Mexicans | Polygenic risk score | Triglycerides | Type 2 diabetes;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;128877;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Forty Murrah calves (20 males, 20 females) between 7–8 months of age (229.05 ± 54 kg) were assigned to one of four groups with ten animals each: NW: non-weaned, AW: abruptly weaned on day 0, NFW: calves fitted with nose-flaps on day −7. At day 0 devices were removed and calves were separated permanently from their mothers, FENW: calves separated from their mothers by a fence-line on day -7. At day 0 calves were separated permanently from their mothers. All physiological indicators; heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), skin surface temperature (SST), rectal temperature (RT), gas exchange, acid-base balance, hydric and mineral balance and energy metabolism were recorded at days −7, −6, −4, 0, 1 and 3. Results show that calves in FENW had higher HR, RR, RT and glucose values (P<0.05) between days −7 and −6 than the other groups, while the AW calves had higher HR, RR, RT, glucose and lactate values between days 0 and 1 (P<0.05). No changes were found for the effect of group in relation to blood gases, acid-base balance, or hydric and mineral balance (P>0.05). Study results demonstrate that abrupt weaning by a fence-line in the early post-separation stage generates changes in physiological and energy metabolism possibly associated with the moment of separation from their mothers. The changes found for effect of weaning strategies in the parameters measured could provide a reference for weaned buffalo calves on their physiology.";Metabolism | Physiology | Stress | Water buffalo calves | Weaning;3;0;;;CONACYT;515743;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Tortilla baking reduced the content of anthocyanins by about 10%. The color parameters of the tortillas added with anthocyanins was similar to that of tortillas made with blue maize. Attenuated total reflection ATR-FTIR spectra showed that the 1022/1047 peak ratio increased, indicative that retrogradation increased with storage time, but the ratio was significantly lower for tortillas with added anthocyanins than without them, and lower for higher anthocyanins concentration. Freshly made tortillas added with anthocyanins exhibited lower ready digestible (about 35%) and slowly digestible (about 20%), but higher resistant (about 45%) starch fractions. Tortillas with 0.12 g of anthocyanins showed significantly lower hardness than the control tortillas (without added anthocyanins). Both previous mentioned effects can be associated with retrogradation, which on turn could be linked to anthocyanins-starch complexes and inhibition of amylolytic enzymes.;Anthocyanins | Hardness | Nixtamalized maize masa | Starch digestibility | Tortilla;9;0;;;;undefined;

Continental ancestries are the major determinants of frequencies of the increased-activity allele CYP2C19*17 and CYP2C19 gUMs (negatively associated with Native American ancestry), decreased-activity alleles CYP2D6*41 and CYP2C9*2 (positively associated with European ancestry), and decreased-activity alleles CYP2D6*17 and CYP2D6*29 (positively associated with African ancestry). For the rare alleles, CYP2C9*2 and CYPC19*17, European admixture accounts for their presence in Native American populations, but rare alleles CYP2D6*5 (null-activity), CYP2D6-multiplication alleles (increased activity), and CYP2C9*3 (decreased-activity) were present in the pre-Columbian Americas. The study of a broad spectrum of Native American populations from different ethno-linguistic groups show how autochthonous diversity shaped the distribution of pharmaco-alleles and give insights on the prevalence of clinically relevant phenotypes associated with drugs, such as paroxetine, tamoxifen, warfarin, and clopidogrel.;;17;0;repositoryvor;Green;NIH;18IA003;National Institutes of Health

depression. In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (FROH) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that FROH is significantly associated (p < 0.0005) with apparently deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: FROH equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44–66%] in the odds of having children. Finally, the effects of FROH are confirmed within full-sibling pairs, where the variation in FROH is independent of all environmental confounding.;;33;1;repositoryam;Green;NIA;R01AG015819;National Institute on Aging

The objective of this review is to summarize the molecular mechanisms of inflammation and oxidative stress activated by Cd at the bone level, particularly in osteoporosis, RA, and OA. Cadmium can increase bone resorption, affect the activity of osteoclasts and calcium (Ca) absorption, and impair kidney function, which favors the development of osteoporosis. In the case of RA, Cd interferes with the activity of antioxidant proteins, like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). It also promotes an inflammatory state, inducing the process of citrullination, which affects the proteins of immune response. On the other hand, accumulation of Cd in the tissues and blood of smokers has been related to the development of some musculoskeletal diseases. Therefore, knowing the negative impact of Cd toxicity at the articular level can help understand the damage mechanisms it produces, leading to the development of such diseases.;Cadmium | Osteoarthritis | Osteoporosis | Oxidative stress | Rheumatoid arthritis;62;0;;;;undefined;

The source of radiation was a mid-pressure mercury lamp (460 W), emitting between 250 and 740 nm. The samples were treated for 60 min, at 25 °C and 45 °C, with the lamp on and with the lamp off. A radiation balance was performed to estimate the total radiation power absorbed by the whole solution. Ascorbic acid content was reduced, either in irradiated or non-irradiated solutions, due to aerobic oxidation. But, in most cases, irradiation did not accelerate degradation. This can be explained by the fact that ascorbic acid barley absorbs ultraviolet in the interval of wavelengths emitted by the lamp (only 31% of the incident radiation P(0) could be absorbed by the solutions). Therefore, mid-pressure mercury lamps are helpful to avoid Vitamin C photo-degradation.;Ascorbic acid | Mid-pressure lamp | Photo-degradation | Ultraviolet radiation | Vitamin C;12;0;;;;undefined;

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor has been widely used in photocatalysis. Doping of different semiconductor oxides into TiO2 has been documented to enhance its photocatalytic activity. In the present work, β-Ga2O3/TiO2 (TG) photocatalysts for H2 production by water/methanol mixture decomposition have been synthesized by the sol–gel method varying the β-Ga2O3 content (3%, 5% and 10% w/w). The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, ultraviolet (UV)-visible diffuse reflectance, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and photoluminescence analysis. Results: An excellent activity for H2 production under UV light (I0 = 2.0 mW cm–2, λ = 254 nm) was detected in TG composites. Experimental results indicated that the maximum H2 production rate was 1217 µmol g−1 during 5 h of reaction and the TG5 photocatalyst was observed to have a higher activity for photocatalytic H2 evolution than pure Ga2O3 and Pt/TiO2 (TPt) test material. Moreover, a possible mechanism of charge separation in the composite under UV light irradiation was proposed. Conclusions: The H2 improved activity of TG5 can be attributed to low charge recombination of the e−-h+ pairs that improves the interfacial charge transfer, which is in agreement with the photoluminescence study. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.;Ga O /TiO 2 3 2 | hydrogen production | photocatalysis | sol–gel | water/methanol;9;0;;;CONACYT;CB-2015-01 256410;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

To help better define the criteria required to choose male broodstock, our objective was to study associations among spermatophore morphometric traits and their relationship with fertility. The variables studied were male body weight (MBW), male body length (MBL), spermatophore weight (SW), sperm cell count (SCC), and percentage of live sperm cells (PLS). To evaluate fertility, female body weight (FBW) was considered, as well as the number of eggs in the spawn (NE), hatching percentage (HP), and the number of nauplii (NN). A random sample of 200 males and 200 females from the broodstock population were obtained. Correlations of SW with body MBW and MBL were estimated as 0.86 ± 0.02 and 0.63 ± 0.04 respectively. Correlations between the SCC with MBW and SW were estimated as 0.52 ± 0.05 and 0.61 ± 0.04 respectively. No linear associations were observed between MBW, SW, and SCC, with the NN (P > 0.05). Also, there was no linear relationship between FBW and NN (P > 0.05). On the other hand, FBW and NE were positively correlated (0.33 ± 0.07).

In this study, we evaluated the microbial interaction of Fusarium falciforme and Staphylococcus aureus developing mixed biofilm in vitro. When both microorganisms grew up together the mixed biofilm biomass decreased than F. falciforme monobiofilm biomass. S. aureus was able to interact and form aggregates over the mycelium and conidia surface of F. falciforme. Our results suggest that S. aureus could bind to colloidal chitin. On another hand, the supernatants from S. aureus biofilm and S. aureus-F. falciforme presented an antifungal effect over F. falciforme biofilm formation. Finally we found that the pH had an inhibitory effect over fungal biofilm formation. We concluded that S. aureus can affect the F. falciforme growth negatively in mixed biofilm involving factors like pH, supernatants compounds, anchor to chitin, and bacterial viability.;Chitin | Fungal-bacterial interactions | Matrix | Mixed biofilms;4;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

And, secondly, to use a Brazilian nopal cookie to complement the perception of the Brazilians regarding the nopal, evaluating their sensory acceptance and possible commercial potential in this country through the Check All That Apply (CATA) test. The cross-cultural study using the word association task has shown that although nopal is not part of the Brazilian food culture, people are willing to accept it as food because of its functional properties. This result, coupled with the positive acceptance of Mexican nopal cookies, confirmed the primary objective of working with products made from this unfamiliar vegetable in Brazil. In this context, the use of Brazilian nopal cladodes resulted in cookies with satisfactory sensory acceptance. This acceptance was similar to the one obtained by the Mexican commercial cookies. The affective and the CATA tests constitute a potential tool to evaluate and develop innovative products made with nopal, thus increasing their commercial potential. The results obtained provide support for a better utilization of this food, mainly in the arid and semi-arid regions, where this cactus is generally abundant, considering the social and cultural context to which the nopal is inserted in each country.;Cactus | Check all that apply | Consumer perception | Cross-cultural study | Sensory analysis | Unfamiliar food | Words association;19;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;CAPES;undefined;Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

We found a significant association between renal malformation and the rs9536282 (KL) variant and between rs4646536 (CYP27B1) and low-BMD, these variants may have modest effects on these characteristics but contribute to the variability of the TS phenotype. In addition, we identified gene–gene interactions between variants in genes KL, CYP27B1 and VDR related to vitamin D-metabolism and low-BMD in TS-patients. Our results support the idea that the genetic background of TS-patients contributes to the clinical variability seen in them.;low bone mineral density | rs4646536 (CYP27B1) | rs7975232 (VDR) | rs9536282 (KL) | Turner syndrome;2;0;;;;057/2015;

On farms where water buffalo are bred for milk production, early weaning favors the amount of milk produced, reduces breeding costs and improves the reproductive rate. However, this early separation may be associated with the restriction of colostrum and essential nutrients for water buffalo calves, which cannot be replaced by the use of milk replacers made for cattle. Consequently, colostrum restriction can lead to an increase in disease susceptibility, high mortality rates and compromises future performance. In addition, mothers show a more temperamental behavior, making milk ejection difficult due to the anatomical characteristics of the udder in this species. On the other hand, a continuous suckling system may be more beneficial to weight, immune status, and welfare of calves but may cause economic losses due to delayed postpartum estrus. The results in terms of susceptibility to stress are contradictory; some authors conclude that separation between mother and calves does not generate stress, as long as weaning is carried out within the first hours or days after birth (3–6 days old) after colostrum intake, compared to weaning at 45 and 90 days. However, these calves have greater difficulty in learning to eat on their own and show an increase in abnormal behaviors. The most commonly utilized form of weaning is abrupt. Behavioral and physiological indicators suggest that abrupt weaning is stressful for both the mother and the offspring. The protocols for performing gradual weaning seem to offer advantages in reducing stress in buffalo compared to abrupt weaning. On buffalo farms, calf management is one of the critical points of breeding, therefore, more studies are required to improve current breeding systems and promote the welfare of water buffalo calves.";Buffalo calves | Productivity | Stress | Weaning | Welfare;11;0;;;CONACYT;515743;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

These American anteater species currently face many conservation threats, among which road traffic accidents stand out. Parasitic studies on this family are scarce, and some of them include records of ectoparasites. Specifically for northern tamandua (T. mexicana), there is a lack of studies at population level. The objectives of the present research were to carry out an epidemiological study of tick species and its abundance on road-killed northern anteater specimens and, moreover, to perform a literature review of ticks collected from anteaters of Myrmecophagidae family. Five tick species were identified, including four Amblyomma spp. and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, on 23 road-killed anteaters. Tick infestation prevalence was 43% (10/23), with a median tick infestation intensity of 3.5 per anteater (interquartile range 1–13.7). The bibliographic review highlighted the existence of twenty-nine ixodid species recorded on the three anteater species from 14 countries, mainly Brazil. The most common tick species on the Myrmecophagidae family are Amblyomma nodosum, A. calcaratum, A. cajennense sensu lato and A. auricularium. Some of these ixodids were also described as vectors of pathogens. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of ticks on anteater fitness, and to assess the role of these mammals as reservoirs of vector-borne diseases.;Ectoparasite: Ixodid | Edentata | Myrmecophaga | Pilosa | Xenarthra;5;0;;;;undefined;

However, it is unclear whether exposure to these chemicals modifies serum levels of miRNAs associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. In the present study, we evaluated the serum levels of miRNAs associated with GDM (miR-9-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-29a-3p and miR-330-3p) and urinary levels of phthalate metabolites (mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and mono(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (MEHP)) and bisphenol A in GDM patients and women without GDM during the second trimester of gestation. We observed higher levels of miR-9-5p, miR-29a-3p and miR-330-3p in sera of patients with GDM compared to non-diabetic subjects. Phthalates were detected in 97–100% of urine samples, while BPA only in 40%. Urinary MEHP and BPA concentrations were remarkably higher in both study groups compared to previously reported data. Unadjusted MEHP levels and adjusted BPA levels were higher in non-diabetics than in GDM patients (p = 0.03, p = 0.02). We found positive correlations between adjusted urinary MBzP levels and miR-16-5p expression levels (p < 0.05), adjusted MEHP concentrations and miR-29a-3p expression levels (p < 0.05). We also found negative correlations between unadjusted and adjusted MBP concentrations and miR-29a-3p expression levels (p < 0.0001, p < 0.05), unadjusted MiBP concentrations and miR-29a-3p expression levels (p < 0.01). Urinary MEHP levels reflect a striking exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in pregnant Mexican women.

The most common aetiological agents are Nocardia brasiliensis and Actinomadura madurae. In response to infection with these organisms the body produces an inflammatory immune response in the skin. The aim of the present study was to determine the production of chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides and the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in keratinocytes infected by A. madurae. Methods: A cell line of HaCaT keratinocytes was infected with A. madurae at a multiplicity of infection of 20:1 for 2 h and the samples were collected from 2 to 72 h post-infection. Intracellular replication of the bacterium was evaluated by counting of colony-forming units, the TLR expression and antimicrobial peptide production were assayed by confocal microscopy and chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Early in the infection, A. madurae was able to achieve intracellular replication in keratinocytes, however, the cells eventually controlled the infection. In response to the infection, keratinocytes overexpressed TLR2 and TLR6, produced high concentrations of cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin 8, human β-defensin-1, human β-defensin-2 and LL37 and low levels of tumour necrosis factor α. Conclusions: The human keratinocytes contribute to the inflammatory process in response to A. madurae infection by overexpressing TLRs and producing chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides.;Actinomadura madurae | Actinomycetoma | Inflammation | Innate immunity | Keratinocytes | Mycetoma | Skin;2;0;;;CONACYT;258735;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are master regulators of gene expression that control oncogenic pathways to modulate the radiotherapy response of cells. In the present study, differential expression profiling assays identified 16 deregulated miRNAs in acquired radioresistant breast cancer cells, of which miR-122 was observed to be up-regulated. Functional analysis revealed that miR-122 has a role as a tumor suppressor in parental cells by decreasing survival and promoting radiosensitivity. However, in radioresistant cells, miR-122 functions as an oncomiR by promoting survival. The transcriptomic landscape resulting from knockdown of miR-122 in radioresistant cells showed modulation of the ZNF611, ZNF304, RIPK1, HRAS, DUSP8 and TNFRSF21 genes. Moreover, miR-122 and the set of affected genes were prognostic factors in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. Our data indicate that up-regulation of miR-122 promotes cell survival in acquired radioresistant breast cancer and also suggest that miR-122 differentially controls the response to radiotherapy by a dual function as a tumor suppressor an and oncomiR dependent on cell phenotype.;breast cancer | microRNAs | miR-122 | radioresistance;29;1;repositoryvor;Green;ICyTDF;115591;Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnología del Distrito Federal

Its phenology is affected by seasonal variations in temperature, salinity, and precipitation, all of which may be altered by impending climate change. In this work, the monthly leaf, flower, and fruit phenology of R. mangle was assessed at three sites, along a natural salinity gradient for 12 months. We assessed phenological states using litter traps installed in mangrove stands, and by direct observation of leaf production at two sites, and flower, and fruit production at a single site. Phenological events were compared with seasonal climatic variations (in wind, rain, and temperature) to explore potential abiotic controls on the phenology of this species. Leaf shedding was lowest at the low salinity site. Leaf and stipule production showed a seasonal trend, decreasing during the cool and dry winter months. Flowering was highly seasonal and synchronous and peaked during the rainy season. Flowering was correlated with average temperature (r = 0.82; p < 0.05) at all three study sites, but was not correlated with precipitation. At the high-salinity site, flowering was restricted to the rainy season. Fruit abortion was associated with wind speed (r = 0.79; p < 0.05). Flowering of R. mangle is induced by increasing temperatures and the onset of rains. Rising temperatures, drier summers, and more frequent and intense storms, due to climate change, may influence mangrove productivity, population dynamics, and floral synchrony.";flowering | fruiting | leafing | stipule production | storm intensity | synchrony | timing | Xel-Há;7;0;;;CONACYT;243375/374628;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

But while most studies have focused on sloth species, anteaters have been overlooked, and in many Leishmania endemic countries like Mexico, no studies have been carried out. The aims of this work were to identify the presence of Leishmania spp. in tissue samples from road-killed northern tamanduas (Tamandua mexicana), using PCR amplification and sequencing of ITS1 DNA, and to discuss the role of Pilosa mammals as reservoirs of Leishmania based on available scientific records. This is the first study that identifies Leishmania in T. mexicana, from 1 of 16 individuals analyzed, so the estimated prevalence (CI 95%) of infection was 6.3% (0.3–27.2). Amplified sequence exhibited a 98.9% (727/735) similarity with L. mexicana, and phylogenetic analysis grouped the species in the L. mexicana-amazonensis cluster. The literature review revealed 241 cases of Leishmania spp. infection among 1219 Pilosa mammals evaluated, with prevalence between studies ranging from 3.5% in the brown-throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) to 78% in the Hoffman’s two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni). Current scientific information indicates that C. hoffmanni sloths are reservoirs of Leishmania, and further studies are needed in order to clarify if other Pilosa species play a role in Leishmania transmission.;Edentata | Leishmaniasis | Mexico | Myrmecophaga | Tamandua mexicana | Xenarthra;4;0;;;;undefined;

Alcohol, which can disrupt folate absorption, is also known to affect the epigenome. We investigated the association of dietary folate and alcohol intake on leukocyte DNA methylation levels in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Leukocyte genome-wide DNA methylation profiles on approximately 450,000 CpG sites were acquired with Illumina HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip measured among 450 women control participants of a case-control study on breast cancer nested within the EPIC cohort. After data preprocessing using surrogate variable analysis to reduce systematic variation, associations of DNA methylation with dietary folate and alcohol intake, assessed with dietary questionnaires, were investigated using CpG site-specific linear models. Specific regions of the methylome were explored using differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis and fused lasso (FL) regressions. The DMR analysis combined results from the feature-specific analysis for a specific chromosome and using distances between features as weights whereas FL regression combined two penalties to encourage sparsity of single features and the difference between two consecutive features. Results: After correction for multiple testing, intake of dietary folate was not associated with methylation level at any DNA methylation site, while weak associations were observed between alcohol intake and methylation level at CpG sites cg03199996 and cg07382687, with q val = 0.029 and q val = 0.048, respectively. Interestingly, the DMR analysis revealed a total of 24 and 90 regions associated with dietary folate and alcohol, respectively. For alcohol intake, 6 of the 15 most significant DMRs were identified through FL. Conclusions: Alcohol intake was associated with methylation levels at two CpG sites. Evidence from DMR and FL analyses indicated that dietary folate and alcohol intake may be associated with genomic regions with tumor suppressor activity such as the GSDMD and HOXA5 genes. These results were in line with the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the association between folate and alcohol, although further studies are warranted to clarify the importance of these mechanisms in cancer.;Alcohol intake | Dietary folate | DMR | DNA methylation | EPIC cohort | Fused lasso;18;1;repositoryvor;Green;ARC;PI13/00061;Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer

Three parallel CNNs are used for local feature extraction, and latter they are fused in the classification task stage. The whole CNN scheme is based on a feature fusion of a fine-CNN, a medium-CNN, and a coarse-CNN. A tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope sensor embedded in a smartphone are used to record the acceleration and angle signals.

However, methods for data collection and analysis of population estimates from wildlife surveys vary, often preventing comparisons between sites or years. In this study we compared population density estimates of spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi, derived from four commonly used methods to the actual density estimate based on known individual monkeys and home-range size and corroborated these results with surveys done on unhabituated monkeys in the same area. We recorded perpendicular distances of individual monkeys in the Otoch Ma’ax yetel Kooh Protected Area during two surveys: within the home range of an individually-recognized spider monkey group (survey one) and largely outside of the home range (survey two). We sighted 278 and 76 spider monkeys for a total effort of 93.74 and 42.78 km in surveys one and two, respectively. The actual density estimate was 65.4 individuals/km 2 (survey one). This value lies closer to the population density estimate obtained using the Kelker method (58.2 individuals/km 2 ) than conventional distance sampling (CDS; 92.9–93.8 individuals/km 2 ). Density estimates obtained with King and maximum perpendicular distance methods deviated substantially from the actual density. Population density estimates using the Kelker method and CDS differed less in survey two. Population density estimates differed little whether transects were walked slow or fast. We recommend using the Kelker method and CDS to estimate population density with a correction for distance estimation errors.

Although larvae of P. panamensis have been previously shown to recruit to artificial settlement platforms, they have never been observed in the water column. The present study describes the reproductive behavior of P. panamensis, with a focus on using molecular tools to document evidence for a larval planktonic stage and for successful recruitment. Larvae collected from the water column, and recruitment on natural and artificial substrata were documented. Phylogenetic analysis of two ribosomal markers, 18s rRNA and ITS (ITS1-5.8-ITS2), and one mitochondrial marker, cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1), confirmed the taxonomic identity of larvae, and showed that larvae and recruits have genotypes similar to adults of P. panamensis. Lipid vacuoles and Symbiodinium sp. were present in the gastrodermis of all larvae. A total of 12 and 371 recruits settled on artificial and natural substrates, respectively, and the recruitment rate differed significantly over time.

Obesity is a crucial factor in the development of metabolic abnormalities, including glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress. A similar scinario occurs during the aging process where alterations of the energetic metabolism homeostasis and a chronic systematic low-grade inflammation have been observed. Oxidative stress and poor physical performance can increase the risk of metabolic disease. Despite the diverse studies on the pathophysiological effects of obesity, its impact related to gender and through life, particularly during aging, hasn't received a reasonable attention. The purpose of this review is to outline the pathophysiological mechanisms and metabolic alterations associated with obesity, with an emphasis on the monosodium glutamate (MSG)-induced obese model. MSG-induced obesity associated inflammation and declined adiponectin were more obvious in male mice, while glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and the redox balance were altered with increased age of both male and female mice. These findings indicate that the metabolic alterations in MSG-induced obesity are associated with the gender as well as aging. Therefore, the MSG obesity model is of a resonable value to underlie the relationship between gender, aging and metabolic alterations in obesity. In addition, we reviewed the medicinal plants and their active constituents which have been used to treat MSG-induced obesity. Given the significat value of this model, studies are needed to scrutinize the benificial effects and underlying mechanisms of medicinal plants with proven anti-obesity activity.;Arcuate nucleous | Inflammation | Medicinal plants | Monosodium glutamate | Obesity | Oxidative stress;47;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Within the strategies for its in vitro synthesis, it is remarkable the employment of fucosidases, enzymes that normally cleave the fucosyl residue from the non-reducing end of fucosylated compounds, as these enzymes are also capable of synthesizing them by means of a transfucosylation reaction.

Higher insect diversity was expected in Olotillo, whose cultivation comprises a wide variety of agroecosystems, and low insect abundance in Nal-Tel with small grains and thick testa. Forty Olotillo cobs were collected at low, medium and high elevations, and 40 each of Nal-Tel at low elevation and Comiteco at high elevation. Cobs were monitored for 30 days under controlled laboratory conditions until all insects emerged. Thickness of testa of 400 grains from each landrace was measured. Community composition and trophic structure were described and standard diversity indices were estimated. A total of 9,708 insects, corresponding to five orders, 24 families and 36 species, were recorded, with six species not previously reported in this region. Insect guilds were composed of 70% phytophages, 22% parasitoids and 8% predators. Species richness was S = 27, 16 and 8 in Olotillo, Comiteco and Nal-Tel, respectively. Nal-Tel and Olotillo had the highest diversity index values (H′ = 1.32 and 1.2, respectively) and no significant differences; Comiteco had the lowest value (H′ = 0.65) and differed significantly from the other landraces. Comiteco and Olotillo, which have large grains and thin testa, showed higher insect abundance than Nal-Tel, which has small grains and thick testa and showed lower abundance. Results support our hypotheses and highlight the role of traditional crop management in insect agrobiodiversity maintenance and conservation.";agroecosystem diversity | elevation gradient | insect guild | testa thickness;2;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

Nevertheless, no specific biomarker of emotional valence or arousal related to dream content has been identified to date. In order to explore the electromyographic (EMG) activity (voltage, number, density and duration) of the corrugator and zygomaticus major muscles during REM sleep and its association with emotional dream mentation, this study performed a series of experimental awakenings after observing EMG facial activations during REM sleep. The study was performed with 12 healthy female participants using an 8-hr nighttime sleep recording. Emotional tone was evaluated by five blinded judges and final valence and intensity scores were obtained. Emotions were mentioned in 80.4% of dream reports. The voltage, number, density and duration of facial muscle contractions were greater for the corrugator muscle than for the zygomaticus muscle, whereas high positive emotions predicted the number (R2 0.601, p = 0.0001) and voltage (R2 0.332, p = 0.005) of the zygomaticus.

We aim to investigate the detailed metabolic profile of SLC16A11 risk haplotype carriers to identify potential physiological mechanisms explaining the increased type 2 diabetes risk. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: We evaluated carriers (n = 72) and non-carriers (n = 75) of the SLC16A11 risk haplotype, with or without type 2 diabetes. An independent sample of 1069 subjects was used to re plicate biochemical findings. The evaluation included euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), MRI and spectroscopy and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies. Results: Fat-free mass (FFM)-adjusted M value was lower in carriers of the SLC16A11 risk haplotype after adjusting for age and type 2 diabetes status (β = .0.164, P = 0.04). Subjects with type 2 diabetes and the risk haplotype demonstrated an increase of 8.76 U/L in alanine aminotransferas e (ALT) (P = 0.02) and of 7.34 U/L in gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT) (P = 0.05) compared with non-carriers and after adjusting for gende r, age and ancestry. Among women with the risk haplotype and normal BMI, the adipocyte size was higher (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Individuals carrying the SLC16A11 risk haplotype exhibited decreased insulin action. Higher serum ALT and GGT levels were found in carriers with type 2 diabetes, and larger adipocytes in subcutaneous fat in the size distribution in carrier women with normal weight.;;8;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The study involved 1260 piglets born to 90 sows (Yorkshire-Landrace × Large-White) classified based on parity as primiparous (n = 30), 2nd–5th parity (n = 30), and 6th–7th parity (n = 30). The vitality of piglets was determined using a numerical score based on respiratory latency, heartbeats, skin color, latency to stand up, and meconium staining of the skin. Temperatures were taken at birth (T1), drying (T2), initial ingestion of colostrum (T3) and 24 hr after birth (T4). The piglets were weighed immediately after being removed from the sow for skin drying. Piglets with low vitality born to primiparous sows had lower birth weights (P < 0.05). The piglets born to 2nd–5th parity sows and exhibited low or medium vitality had a lower temperature at T1(1 °C) and T2 (2 °C) compared to the high vitality groups (P < 0.05). The piglets born to 6–7th parity sows and exhibited high vitality increased the temperature by 1.5 °C at T4 compared to those of the low and medium vitality groups. It was concluded that independently of parity, piglets with low birth weights and low vitality scores at birth are unable to increase ocular temperature even after ingesting colostrum.;Farrowing | Neonate | Piglet | Sows | Thermographic | Welfare;14;0;;;;undefined;

Initially, the juveniles were located in one brown tank (BT1), later almost half of the individuals were placed in a white tank (WT) where they showed a pigmentation change to white. After being moved to another brown tank (BT2), the juveniles changed to their brown original colour, but kept a few small white spots on the dorsal axis of the body. The ventral head melanophore pattern also changed in the white specimens. Temperature (C), oxygen (mg l -1 ) and Illuminance light (Lux m -2 ), total length (mm) and total weight (g) were determined by tank. Chromaticity was measured in L∗(relative luminance) a∗(measurement relating to the redness or greenness of the light) b∗(measurement relating to the yellowness or blueness of the light) coordinates where all three values are required to completely describe an object's colour. One-way ANOVA showed no differences for temperature, oxygen and illuminance light among tanks. Length and weight were similar for BT1 and WT but both were different from BT2. The white juveniles depicted similar L∗ as the WT background as well as the dorsal area of the brown pigmentation and converted juveniles to the brown tanks BT1 and BT2, respectively.

However, the presence of undetected population structure can lead to both false positive results and failures to detect genuine associations. Even when most of the approaches to deal with population stratification require genome-wide data, the use of a well-selected panel of ancestry informative markers (AIMs) may appropriately correct for population stratification. Few panels of AIMs have been developed for Latino populations and most contain a high number of markers (> 100 AIMs). For some association studies such as candidate gene approaches, it may be unfeasible to genotype a numerous set of markers to avoid false positive results. In such cases, methods that use fewer AIMs may be appropriate. Results: We validated an accurate and cost-effective panel of AIMs, for use in population stratification correction of association studies and global ancestry estimation in Mexicans, as well as in populations having large proportions of both European and Native American ancestries. Based on genome-wide data from 1953 Mexican individuals, we performed a PCA and SNP weights were calculated to select subsets of unlinked AIMs within percentiles 0.10 and 0.90, ensuring that all chromosomes were represented. Correlations between PC1 calculated using genome-wide data versus each subset of AIMs (16, 32, 48 and 64) were r 2 = 0.923, 0.959, 0.972 and 0.978, respectively. When evaluating PCs performance as population stratification adjustment covariates, no correlation was found between P values obtained from uncorrected and genome-wide corrected association analyses (r 2 = 0.141), highlighting that population stratification correction is compulsory for association analyses in admixed populations. In contrast, high correlations were found when adjusting for both PC1 and PC2 for either subset of AIMs (r 2 > 0.900). After multiple validations, including an independent sample, we selected a minimal panel of 32 AIMs, which are highly informative of the major ancestral components of Mexican mestizos, namely European and Native American ancestries. Finally, the correlation between the global ancestry proportions calculated using genome-wide data and our panel of 32 AIMs was r 2 = 0.972. Conclusions: Our panel of 32 AIMs accurately estimated global ancestry and corrected for population stratification in association studies in Mexican individuals.;AIM | Ancestry | Association study | Mexican mestizos | Population stratification;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Significance: Colloidal aqueous dispersions of lyotropic liquid crystal mesophases such as the identified as cubosomes and hexosomes, and so on, have received considerable attention due to their unique nanostructures and their thermodynamic properties, which provide the potential as a sustained drug release matrix. Additionally, their large surface area and similarity with the liquid crystal structures of intercellular lipids of stratum corneum enhances the interaction with the skin and mucous, increasing the potential for topical drug delivery efficiency of biopharmaceutical class II drugs as the antifungal ketoconazole. Methods: This article presents the results in morphological characteristics, particle size, ζ potential, flow, thermal behavior and drug release studies of hexosomes containing ketoconazole (LHLC-K) obtained with glycerol monooleate, propylene glycol monolaurate, poloxamer, and water mixtures. Results: This colloidal system exhibits a Newtonian-type flow and a hexagonal nanostructure with a median particle size of 107 ± 20 nm and ζ potential of +4.45 ± 0.50 mV. Through differential scanning calorimetry studies, the LHLC-K demonstrated physical and chemical stability for more than six months and mesophasic thermal reversibility between 10 and 50 °C. Finally, LHLC-K releases ketoconazole following a kinetics described by the first order model. Conclusions: Physicochemical properties of the hexosomes containing ketoconazole are important for topical mycosis treatment administration, conditions of storage, and for its incorporation into the formulation of semi-solid dosage forms.;drug delivery | Hexosomes | ketoconazole | lyotropic liquid crystals | physicochemical characterization | thermal behavior | topical;10;0;;;;undefined;

Additionally, some types of forest management, such as secondary vegetation removal (“chaponeo”), can be another disturbance that negatively affects the values of some environmental variables important for seed germination. Light, soil temperature and moisture characterize microsites and determine germination percentages. These variables are also affected by slope orientation and vegetation structure. The aim of this study was to characterize microsites for Symphoricarpos microphyllus seed germination in a temperate forest, its response to light qualities in germination cameras, and seed viability during two years. Methods: Twenty-four microsites that differed according to their position in north/south (N/S) facing slopes, and by the presence/absence of secondary vegetation (“chaponeo”) due to forest management (U-undisturbed/P-perturbed) were characterized for light, soil temperature, moisture, pH and nitrogen. We also studied germination under different light qualities (white light, red light, far red light -FRL-, darkness) in germination cameras and seed viability for two years. Key results: All microsites were different in light, temperature and soil moisture. Microsites with the highest germination percentages were those US (undisturbed south) and UN (undisturbed north), where higher soil moisture and lower temperatures were registered, favoring embryo growth of seeds, since they possess morphophysiological dormancy. In cameras, germination percentages were the highest in FRL (32%). Seeds of S. microphyllus can remain viable for two years (60%). Conclusions: We do not recommend secondary vegetation removal because it affects variables of soil moisture (decreasing it) and temperature (increasing it) in microsites.

An experiment was conducted to evaluate the feed intake, digestibility and growth of pigs fed with two feeds (A and K) specially formulated for this species and a commercial feed for growing rabbits with supplementation of vitamin C (RF+VC). Materials and methods. Eighteen Guinea pigs of 248±38 g initial body weight were distributed in a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement 3×2 (dietary treatments and sex). Feed and neutral detergent fiber intake, weight gain, feed/gain, and morphometric variables were measured individually for 30 days. Dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility were measured during the last seven days of the experiment. Results. There were no differences on feed intake (p=0.88); however, the dry matter digestibility was higher (p<0.01) in feeds formulated for Guinea pigs (A and K) and lower in the rabbit feed plus vitamin C. The intake and digestibility of NDF were higher in the RF+VC and lower in feeds for Guinea pigs (p< 0.01). The average daily gain was similar among the treatments (p>0.05). There were no differences (p>0.01) in the morphometric variables among dietary treatments, but there were sex differences as the males were bigger than the females (p<0.01). Conclusions.

Of the four milk brands analyzed, three were ultrapasteurized (UHT) and one was pasteurized (HTST). The milk was acquired from March-June 2016. Three extraction methods were tested: saponification (method A); detergent solution extraction (method B); and liquid-liquid extraction (method C). The PAH profiles from each method were generated by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. Three of the four milk brands (75 %) were positive for at least one of the sixteen analyzed PAHs. Profiles differed by extraction method with only low molecular weight compounds in method A, both low and high molecular weight compounds in method B, and higher recovery rates of low and high molecular weight compounds in method C.

Sedentary lifestyle in the elderly contributes to this condition; however, physical activity improves health, reducing morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have shown that metformin (MTF) can also prevent muscle damage promoting muscular performance. To date, there is great controversy if MTF treatment combined with exercise training improves or nullifies the benefits provided by physical activity. This study is aimed at evaluating the effect of long-term moderate exercise combined with MTF treatment on body composition, strength, redox state, and survival rate during the life of female Wistar rats. In this study, rats performed moderate exercise during 20 of their 24 months of life and were treated with MTF for one year or for 6 months, i.e., from 12 to 24 months old and 18 to 24 months old. The body composition (percentage of fat, bone, and lean mass) was determined using a dual-energy X-ray absorption scanner (DXA), and grip strength was determined using a dynamometer. Likewise, medial and tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials were evaluated and the redox state was measured by HPLC, calculating the GSH/GSSG ratio in the gastrocnemius muscle. Our results suggest- that the MTF administration, both in the sedentary and the exercise groups, might activate a mechanism that is directly related to the induction of the hormetic response through the redox state modulation. MTF treatment does not eliminate the beneficial effects of exercise throughout life, and although MTF does not increase muscle mass, it increases longevity.";;22;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

This work makes the TRIAD zoning approach operational through a mathematical model to optimize the forestry planning process. This approach proposes dividing the forest under management into an intensive harvesting area, an extensive harvesting area, and a conservation area, according to the production objectives established. A mixed integer nonlinear optimization model was formulated to maximize the present value of gains derived from timber production, while satisficing operative and biodiversity conservation restrictions associated with the forest community of San Pedro El Alto, Oaxaca, Mexico. The model was solved through a genetic algorithm, in their simple version (GNS), and two variants of it (GN2 and GN3). The process allowed completing three objectives: 1) to propose and validate a model capable of generating comparable solutions to the current management scenario in the community, 2) to compare three different solution algorithms, and 3) to offer an efficient algorithm to solve similar optimization problems.;Biodiversity conservation | Forest management planning | Functional zoning | Genetic algorithms | TRIAD;2;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The pathophysiology of MAS is complex. The underlying mechanism of MAS is fetal hypoxia which causes redistribution of fetal blood, increased intestinal peristalsis and relaxation of the anal sphincter in utero, leading to the passage of meconium into the amniotic fluid. If hypoxia is severe and persistent, the fetus gasps for air, but instead aspirate amniotic fluid contaminated with meconium. Aspiration of meconium produces multiple physiological and structural changes in the neonatal lung which relates partially to the amount of aspirated meconium. The structural and functional sequels of MAS include airways obstruction, atelectasis, chemical pneumonitis, hypoxemia, acidosis, pulmonary hypertension and occasionally death. MAS survivors can develop airway hyperreactivity and nervous sequelae. The morbidity and mortality of human MAS have declined the last decades because of new therapies but remains a major paediatric problem. Although the prevalence and significance of MAS in veterinary medicine have been poorly investigated, there is ample evidence that intrapartum hypoxia in animals also causes meconium expulsion, amniotic staining and aspiration. The lungs of affected animals showed airway obstruction, focal atelectasis and alveolitis. Meconium staining of the skin and aspiration are indicators of fetal or perinatal hypoxia and postnatal respiratory distress in domestic animals. Experimental models have been developed to study the pathogenesis of MAS in laboratory animals. This review focuses on the current concepts of the pathophysiology of MAS in human and veterinary medicine.;Anoxia | Asphyxia | MAS | Meconium | Neonate;7;0;;;;undefined;

The antioxidant activity of the oligomers was evaluated by their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their capacity to chelate metal ions Fe2+ and Cu2+. The antitumor effect of the oligomers was determined by their ability to induce toxicity in the T24 human bladder cancer cell line. By enzymatic peroxidase oxidation, it was possible to produce oligomers of catechin, epicatechin, and resveratrol with antioxidant capacity significantly higher than their preceding monomers. The ROS scavenging capacity of the oligomers was 20 times higher than that of the monomers, while the ability of the oligomers to chelate metal ions increased up to about 1000 times.

In 2003, the Mexican government through the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) implemented the Payment for Hydrological Environmental Services (PHES) to address the problems of water and deforestation in the country. A prerequisite for an area to receive the PHES is to maintain a minimum 80% forest cover, or increase it during the five-year contract. PHES program Assessments on forest cover have been mainly national or regional scale studies. In Mexico there is not impact assessment at community level scale at which the PHES is executed. This study assesses the impact of PHES on the forest cover dynamics in six ejidos of the Iztaccíhuatl-Popocatépetl region, Puebla. To perform the study, two Quickbird images were used and a supervised classification was performed. The results indicate that the PHES achieved its goal in four of the six ejidos.;Environmental service | Hydrologic services | México | Puebla;1;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Methods: Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were exposed to bare 20 nm AuNPs in the presence and absence of 1×10−9 ME2 for different time intervals for up to 24 hrs. The effects of AuNP incorporation and E2 incubation on the MCF-7 cell surface roughness were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Endocytic vesicle formation was studied using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Finally, the results were confirmed by hyperspectral optical microscopy. Results: High-resolution AFM images of the surfaces of MCF-7 membranes (up to 250 nm2) were obtained. The incubation of cells for 12 hrs with AuNP and E2 increased the cell membrane roughness by 95% and 30% compared with the groups treated with vehicle (ethanol) or AuNPs only, respectively. This effect was blocked by an ER antagonist (7α,17β-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-Pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol [ICI] 182,780). Higher amounts of AuNPs were localized inside MCF-7 cells around the nucleus, even after 6 hrs of E2 incubation, compared with vehicle-treated cells. Endolysosome formation was induced by E2, which may be associated with an increase in AuNP-uptake. Conclusions: E2 enhances AuNP incorporation in MCF-7 cells by modulating of plasma membrane roughness and inducing lysosomal endocytosis. These findings provide new insights into combined nanotherapies and hormone therapies for breast cancer.;AuNP cellular uptake | Endocytosis | Estrogen-induced vesicle formation | Hormone therapy | Membrane roughness | Nanotherapy;14;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

However, like other mammals, bats show common distributional patterns strongly influenced by their biotic and abiotic interactions, aspects that have been poorly analyzed mainly due to technical and methodological limitations. Such occurrence data are limited to a subset of a species' range, the scale of occurrence records, characteristics of the life history (e. g., territory size, vagility) of the taxa being studied, and issues of environmental variable selection and, therefore, the modeling methods and the evaluation of them. In this work, the objectives were to: 1) Evaluate the spatial variation in bat richness in Mexico, both for the order as a whole and at the family taxonomic level. 2) Quantify overlapping species occurrences and corresponding richness values in order to statistically model and generate bat richness maps at different taxonomic levels. 3) Explore the relationship of bat richness with environmental factors and with the biogeographic regions proposed for Mexico. 4) Identify areas of interest with high richness. The information available on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility database for bat species with distribution in Mexico was downloaded, and clearly erroneous records deleted. Using the Kriging Ordinary utility (KO), inside the QGIS software, a geostatistical analysis interpolation data was used to determine patterns of richness. The relationship of bat richness to climate, vegetation, and the biotic provinces proposed for Mexico was also explored. Spatial variation in richness was evaluated at the taxonomic levels of order and family. Based on this determination, areas of interest were identified for their high richness. When considering all species of bats the highest diversity is in the central part of the West, the Northeast zone and on both sides of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. However, there are differences present at the family level. Deciduous tropical forest vegetation type presents high bat richness, followed by pine-oak forest and evergreen tropical forest. Temperate sub-humid, warm sub-humid and warm-humid climate types correspond to the highest bat richness of both order and family. Collection localities are not uniformly distributed over the country, most of them being concentrated in the west, east and south of the country, while there are very few records in the north and central plateau, and this is reflected in the richness concentration per cell (values from 0 to 52 species per cell). Protection of the four areas with an overall high concentration of bat richness detected in this analysis should be a priority during the development of conservation strategies.;Biogeographic regions | Environmental factors | Geostatistical method | Kriging | Mexican bats | Richness maps;5;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;CONACyT;128459;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

CVD is a comorbidity in diabetes and contributes to premature death. Citrus flavonoids possess several biological activities and have emerged as efficient therapeutics for the treatment of CVD. Citrus flavonoids scavenge free radicals, improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, modulate lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation, suppress inflammation and apoptosis, and improve endothelial dysfunction. The intake of citrus flavonoids has been associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. Although citrus flavonoids exerted multiple beneficial effects, their mechanisms of action are not completely established. In this review, we summarized recent findings and advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of citrus flavonoids against oxidative stress, inflammation, diabetes, dyslipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis. Further studies and clinical trials to assess the efficacy and to explore the underlying mechanism(s) of action of citrus flavonoids are recommended.;;113;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Fermentations were terminated at pH 4.5 and stored for 21 days at 4 °C. Survival was determined by viable count in MRS-agar. The production of free amino groups was performed by the TNBS method and peptide separation was performed by SDS-PAGE. During fermentation, pH decreased faster in milk with agave juice than with inulin. There was no significant difference in the concentration of free amino groups (0.632 ± 0.007 and 0.627 ± 0.007 mg/L) between the two fermentation systems for any microorganism. The concentration of lactic acid bacteria in the presence of agave juice was higher than the recommended concentration for probiotic foods (7.59 log CFU/mL for L. rhamnosus GG and 8.26 log CFU/mL for L. casei Shirota). The production of free amino groups and peptides of low molecular weight continued in refrigeration and was higher in systems with agave juice. This could represent a proteolytic activation in the presence of this carbon source. The results showed that agave juice might be a functional ingredient with prebiotic character in symbiotic systems.;Agave juice | Fermented milk | Inulin | Lactic acid bacteria | Prebiotic | Proteolysis;8;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Such responding usually manifests as a tendency that opposes that of a stimulus that predicts the outcome, also known as a conditioned excitor. Some learning theorists have expressed concerns about the validity and usefulness of conditioned inhibition as a concept; claims that may have negatively affected the reputation of this research area. This article offers a contemporary review of critiques of and controversies over conditioned inhibition and of arguments advanced in its defense. Some of these disputes have been reported in previous reviews, but here we have sought to compile the most representative among them. We also propose new arguments that answer some of those critiques. We then address the most prominent theoretical accounts of conditioned inhibition, identifying commonalities and differences among some of them. Finally, we review recent studies of conditioned inhibition. Some of the new findings contribute to rejecting early critiques of conditioned inhibition and others further elucidate the nature of this phenomenon. A new set of studies suggests that a deficit in conditioned inhibition characterizes some psychiatric conditions, illustrating its translational importance. We believe that new generations of researchers will benefit from being aware of past controversies and how they may have shaped the current conception of conditioned inhibition.";Animal behavior | Associative learning | Learning theories | Pavlovian conditioning | Response inhibition;14;0;;;CONACYT;592937;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The cultural variety in culinary practices across countries raises the question of how flavor combinations are built and how they transcend individual differences in consumers’ preferences. For example, in Latin America, despite having similar cultures and language, the diversity in culinary practices leads to different flavor combinations across nations. Therefore, we hypothesize that each country will show different preferences in flavor combinations that could be understood by social media exploration as an innovative approach. One study was conducted exploring social media in four countries (Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico) on a one-year basis, using a list of fifty-seven keywords associated with beer flavors. In a first analysis, the list of mentions from consumers was categorized in frequencies of flavors per country and analyzed using correspondence analysis (CA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). Results showed that the countries could be clustered in three groups. Cluster 1 with Mexico and Peru, and the rest of the countries in different clusters. The co-occurrence of paired flavors in social media was used to build a similarity matrix that was analyzed using multidimensional scaling (MDS) in order to find a pattern of pairing per country. The obtained map was useful to understand the cultural differences in flavor paring per country. Overall, the analysis of flavor pairing through social media was an effective technique to access the structure of flavor pairing for beer in different countries.;Beer pairing | Cross-cultural | Flavor pairing | Food pairing | Latin America | Social media;19;0;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;520074/574751;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We evaluated 1505 neonate piglets, which were born of York-Landrace sows with the following parity distribution: primiparous (n = 202), second (n = 207), third (n = 211), fourth (n = 222), fifth (n = 225), sixth (n = 218) and seventh parity (n = 220). Piglets born to primiparous and seventh-parity sows had the lowest and highest birthweights respectively, and showed the most marked imbalances in blood gas exchanges, acid-base balance and energy profiles, as well as the highest percentage of severe meconium staining of the skin and the lowest vitality scores (P < 0.05). In contrast, the neonates from the fourth-parity sows had the highest vitality scores, required less time to reach the mother's teat, and had the highest percentage of adhered umbilical cords and newborns with dyspnoea, apnoea and abnormal heartbeat (P < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that during eutocic farrowings, the sow's parity number has the following effects on newborn piglets: reduced vigour and longer latencies to begin breathing, stand and take the teat. These effects are due to the presence of imbalances in gas exchanges, the acid-base balance and energy profiles that occurred when the mother was a primiparous or older sow. These signs indicate that the newborn piglet survived a process of intrapartum asphyxia.;birth | lactate | neonatal asphyxia | piglet | vitality;2;0;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The largest amount of data on emerging diseases relates to bacterial and viral pathogens, but there is a lack of parasite data, especially from wildlife. Monitoring wildlife parasitic diseases should be considered a priority, especially in high biodiversity regions with strong anthropogenic impacts, like Mexico, where the wildlife/livestock/human interface is associated with increased risk of disease transmission. Mexico belongs to the top-ten megadiverse countries and is located between two biogeographic regions. This situation makes Mexico a favourable region for the spillover of animal pathogens to human beings, causing pandemics, such as the one recently caused by influenza virus A (H1N1). The current state of knowledge of Mexican wildlife parasites is scarce and focuses mainly in Neotropical fauna. Moreover, this knowledge is heterogeneous for different parasite groups, especially concerning their pathologic effects and epidemiology. The goals of this review are to compile information on Mexican wildlife parasites and to identify knowledge gaps in order to stimulate research on pending epidemiological, public health, ecological and pathological areas, and to encourage the creation of more specialized groups from the perspective of the One-Health concept.;Biodiversity | Emerging diseases | Extinction | Megadiverse | One health | Zoonoses;7;0;;;;undefined;

In contrast, their morphological evolution is little studied and poorly understood. Geometric morphometric methods based on scale shape were applied in this study to determine differences among species and genera. Scale shapes were described using seven landmarks, the coordinates of which were subjected to a generalized Procrustes analysis, followed by a principal components analysis. A cross-validated discriminant analysis was applied to assess and compare the size-shape (centroid size plus shape variables) efficacy in the species and the discrimination of the genera. Two main phenetic groups were identified: Cluster no. 1 with eight species and cluster no. 2 with six species. Coelorhinchus aspercephalus and Mesovagus antipodum were more separated from the other species in the first cluster. The cross-validated canonical discriminant analysis correctly classified 74% at the genus level, with most misclassifications occurring between Coelorhinchus and Coryphaenoides, whereas the best classified genera were Mesovagus and Trachyrincus. The discrimination of correctly classified species ranged from 41.2 to 100%. The highest correct classification rates were recorded for Coryphaenoides armatus, Coelorhinchus innotabilis, Trachyrincus longirostris and Mesovagus antipodum.;discrimination analysis | geometric morphometrics | landmarks | Rattail fish | scale morphology;9;0;;;;undefined;

Additional direct responses to stochastic environmental factors ensure the fine-tuning to the actual situation and may mask the circadian time course. Following an observational study on behavioral effects of visitor activities in a group of spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) kept free-ranging on a small island of Lake Catemaco, Veracruz, Mexico, we analyzed the effect of weekly varying numbers of visiting tourist boats on the monkeys’ diel activity rhythm. With small accelerometer-data logger devices we recorded the monkeys’ locomotor activity continuously for several months each. Then we compared the data with those from spider monkeys living without tourist contact. Neither the duration of the monkeys’ activity time (α) nor its phase relationship to the 24-hr solar day did change on different weekdays in either site. However, their activity level showed a clear 7-day rhythm. The monkeys of the tourist site showed highest activity on Saturday and Sunday, when the frequency of visiting tourist boats was highest, whereas those of the non-tourist site were least active on Sunday and Monday, when human activities were lowest there. While the monkeys of the non-tourist site usually displayed a distinct bimodal activity pattern peaking in the morning and late afternoon, the pattern in those of the tourist site mostly lacked a morning peak and varied more over time. Based on our results, we suggest that circadian entrainment is not involved in the differences between the diel activity rhythms of the spider monkeys from the two keeping sites and the differing 7-day variation in their activity level. Rather, these differences seemingly reflect direct responses to the differing human activities and thus may correspond to circadian masking effects.;activity pattern | circadian rhythm | circaseptan rhythm | masking effect | zoo visitor effect;3;0;;;CONACYT;0220300;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The optimal fermentation conditions were 10% inoculum, 15% sucrose and 85% crab biomass, producing 17 mg lactic acid/ g silage. Extracted and purified chitin, after 60 h fermentation, showed 99.6 and 95.3% demineralization and deproteinization, respectively, using low concentrated acids and bases.

Yet, the manner in which stress disturbs reproduction in goats is currently unknown. The Oaxacan Mixteca region is one of Mexico's poorest, with high levels of deforestation, high ambient temperatures, and lack of water. Native goats of the Oaxacan Mixteca Region live in these stressful conditions, as well as in overcrowded and water restricted conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of these very stressful conditions on the reproduction of male and female goats. Control group was uncrowded, with daily water supply; stress group was overcrowded, with water restriction. The study was conducted from September 2015 to February 2016; the expression of reproductive behaviour and variations of cortisol levels were assessed. In females, oestradiol and progesterone were evaluated during the oestrous cycle. In males, testosterone levels were evaluated before and during reproductive activity. Sexual behaviour decreased in stressed goats: approaching, tail swishing, urination, vaginal discharge and flank contraction decreased in stressed females. Anogenital sniffing, licking, Flehmen reflex, bleating, mount attempts and mounts decreased in male goats. Cortisol levels in stressed animals were higher compared with control animals. Oestradiol and Progesterone levels in stressed females were significantly lower during the follicular and luteal phase, respectively, compared with control females. Testosterone levels in stressed males were lower than in control males, both before and during reproduction. These results indicate that even though goats from the Oaxacan Mixteca Region are habituated to their environmental conditions, they are still stressed by them, as shown by a higher activation of the adrenal axis in stressed goats than in control goats. High cortisol levels may induce low oestradiol levels in females and low testosterone levels in males, as well as a disruption in the expression of their reproductive behaviour.";cortisol | goats | reproduction | sexual behaviour | stress;0;0;;;;undefined;

For each segment, a bivariate JSD matrix was constructed to obtain global and local coupling indices in accordance to Shannon's entropy and the probability of occurrence of various bivariate words, respectively. The novel approach revealed important findings in the coupling dynamics of the systems, thus allowing the detection of group differences during the early orthostatic phase, and during the HUT test, before the occurrence of any pre-syncopal symptoms. In patients, the global indices indicated a significant decrease of cardiovascular coupling, starting at 10 min after the tilt-up, manifested by reduced baroreflex sensitivity and cardiorespiratory coupling that was initiated 8 min after the onset of the orthostatic phase (OP). A decreased autonomic control on cardiovascular–respiratory couplings was further evidenced by increased alterations of the JSD indices during the OP compared to the supine position in patients compared to controls. Furthermore, findings based on local indices demonstrated that female patients showed reductions and disengagements in cardiovascular (p < 0.001) and cardiorespiratory (p < 0.01) couplings, as early as the first 5 min and during the complete OP.;Cardiorespiratory coupling | Cardiovascular coupling | Joint symbolic dynamics | Orthostatic stress | Vascular–respiratory coupling | Vasovagal syncope;4;0;;;;undefined;

Further analysis of activation state of multiple signaling pathways using Phosphorylation Antibody Arrays revealed that miR-204 reduced the expression and phosphorylation levels of 13 proteins involved in PI3K/AKT, RAF1/MAPK, VEGF, and FAK/SRC signaling. In agreement with phospho-proteomic profiling, VM was impaired following pharmacological administration of PI3K and SRC inhibitors. Mechanistic studies confirmed that miR-204 exerts a negative post-transcriptional regulation of PI3K-α and c-SRC proto-oncogenes. Moreover, overall survival analysis of a large cohort of breast cancer patients indicates that low miR-204 and high FAK/SRC levels were associated with worst outcomes. In conclusion, our study provides novel lines of evidence indicating that miR-204 may exerts a fine-tuning regulation of the synergistic transduction of PI3K/AKT/FAK mediators critical in VM formation.;Breast cancer | miR-204 | Phospho-proteomics | Signaling pathways | Vasculogenic mimicry;28;0;;;UNAM;222335;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

In June 2014, we analyzed the spatial distribution pattern with Ripley's K-function and the possible association of Astrophytum myriostigma with nurse plants in two populations (Rioverde and Pozas, San Luis Potosí, Mexico). We estimated canopy cover of perennial plant species with a logarithmic scale method and determined the association, size, and orientation of A. myriostigma in relation to nurse plants. Astrophytum myriostigma had an aggregated distribution pattern; approximately 50% were associated with nurse plants at Rioverde and 63% at Pozas, with Hechtia glomerata (Bromeliaceae) being the main nurse plant species in both populations. Cacti associated with nurse plants at Pozas were larger than those not associated, and they did not have any significant orientation in relation to the nurse plant crown. In contrast, the size of associated and nonassociated cacti at Rioverde was similar, but they were established significantly more frequently under the north side of the nurse plant. The association of A. myriostigma with nurse plants is facultative, through either nurse plant protection or open spaces, likely related with abiotic nurses. Understanding nurse plant associations will help target key species for conservation and identify the most likely associations to increase the survival of reintroduced individuals.";;2;0;;;CONACYT;221362;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

precision medicine. The RIBEF-CEIBA Network Consortium was established to characterize interindividual and between population variations in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 drug metabolizing enzyme genotypes, which were subsequently utilized to catalog their ""predicted drug metabolism phenotypes"" across Native American and Ibero American populations. Importantly, we report in this study, a total of 6060 healthy individuals from Ibero-America who were classified according to their self-reported ancestry: 1395 Native Americans, 2571 Admixed Latin Americans, 96 Afro-Latin Americans, 287 white Latin Americans (from Cuba), 1537 Iberians, and 174 Argentinean Ashkenazi Jews. Moreover, Native Americans were grouped into North-, Central-, and South Amerindians (from Mexico, Costa Rica, and Peru, respectively). All subjects were studied for the most common and functional CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 allelic variants, and grouped as genotype-predicted poor or ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes (gPMs and gUMs, respectively). Native Americans showed differences from each ethnic group in at least two alleles of CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Native Americans had higher frequencies of wild-type alleles for all genes, and lower frequency of CYP2D6∗41, CYP2C9∗2, and CYP2C19∗17 (p <0.05). Native Americans also showed less CYP2C19 gUMs than the rest of the population sample. In addition, differences within Native Americans (mostly North vs. South were also found. The interethnic differences described supports the need for population-specific personalized and precision medicine programs for Native Americans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study carried out in Native Americans and other Ibero-American populations analyzing CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms. Population pharmacogenomics is a nascent field of global health and warrants further research and education.";Amerindians | CYP2C19 | CYP2C9 | CYP2D6 | drug metabolism | Latin Americans | Pharmacogenetics | precision medicine;24;0;;;;undefined;

As a part of standard preclinical safety tests, the present study sought to determine potential developmental toxicity (in female rats) and genotoxicity (in male mice) of KACY. Pregnant female rats were divided into six groups: the negative control (vehicle), the positive control (250 mg/kg of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)), and four experimental groups (50, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg of KACY). To evaluate genotoxicity by in vivo micronuclei (MN) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) tests, male mice were divided into five groups: the negative control (vehicle), the positive control (1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg of doxorubicin for MN and SCE, respectively), and three experimental groups (50, 500 and 1000 mg/kg of KACY). All treatments were administered by oral gavage. A slight maternal toxicity was evidenced by lower weight gain for rats receiving 500 and 1000 mg/kg of KACY, but no fetal malformations were found. However, there were less live fetuses/litter and greater post-implantation loss/litter at these two doses. Manifestations of developmental toxicity were limited to a higher rate of skeletal alterations. The MN tests did not evidence genotoxicity or cytotoxicity. KACY caused a slightly but significantly increased frequency of SCE. Although KACY-treated rats had skeletal alterations, these apparently were not caused by a mechanism of genotoxicity. Furthermore, the same administration in adult male mice did not produce genotoxicity. Hence, KACY herein proved to be safe for rats during the period of organogenesis.;Kramecyne | Micronuclei | Sister chromatid exchange | Teratogenic study;7;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Several authors have calculated by simulations the first four terms in the high-temperature perturbation expansion for SW ranges from λ = 1 up to λ = 2.5 or 3. Besides, the asymptotic form of the first two terms in the expansion, for λ large, is known analytically. The information gathered so far seems to indicate that a range of λ = 3 is not far from this asymptotic van der Waals regime. In this work, we use the technique of singular value decomposition (SVD) to provide us with expressions of the SW free energy valid for all ranges of 1 ≤ λ and, for the higher-order terms, covering the density range upto the random close-packed state. Besides rendering unified expressions of the free energy for all ranges, the SVD allows us to separate the perturbation terms into a sum of products of functions of density and range, so that one can discern the most important contributions and extract the underlying density and range profiles.;free energy | singular value decomposition | Square well;6;0;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;FDC 2015-02-1450;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In this study, a total of 8,126 serum samples were obtained from 275 technified and semi-technified farms belonging to 30 of the 32 states of Mexico and representative of the eight regions of the country. Anti-PRRSv antibodies against the PRRS vaccine and an isolated wild Mexican virus were tested by ELISA. Antibodies were found in 15%–49% of the tested sera, with 2.4%–9.8% against the vaccine and 7.7%–26% against the wild virus. The PRRSv virus was detected by RT-PCR in 77 of the 1,630 pooled samples tested, representing seven of the eight geographic regions into which the Mexican Republic is divided. The complete sequences of open reading frames 5 and 7 from 20 PRRSv-positive samples were determined. The analysis of the sequences together with the previously published sequences of historic strains revealed that all the strains belonged to the one, five and eight lineages of the PRRSV2. Striking differences, particularly in ORF5 and ORF7, were found between sequences of the strains and the reference virus, due to insertions and substitutions in positions that play key roles in the recognition, structure and function of the virus. Overall, these results established the magnitude of PRRS virus genetic diversity, and the most frequent virus strain that predominates in Mexico. The PRRSV2 is presented in the porcine population of Mexico; the circulating strains have important changes in ORF5 and ORF7, which probably explain the results obtained in the serological analysis of the wild virus and vaccine strains.";frequency | PRRSv | seroprevalence;6;0;;;CONACYT;254244;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The present study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms of two pathways to cancer transformation with the purpose of identifying potential biomarkers. Our approach is based on a meta-analysis of gene expression profiling contrasting two scenarios: A model that describes a transformation pathway from melanocyte to melanoma and a second model where transformation occurs through an intermediary nevus. Data consists of three independent, publicly available microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database comprising samples from melanocytes, nevi and melanoma. The present analysis identified 808 differentially expressed genes (528 upregulated and 360 downregulated) in melanoma compared with nevi, and 2,331 differentially expressed genes (946 upregulated and 1,385 downregulated) in melanoma compared with melanocytes. Further analysis narrowed down this list, since 682 differentially expressed genes were found in both models (417 upregulated and 265 downregulated). Enrichment analysis identified relevant dysregulated pathways. This article also presented a discussion on significant genes including ADAM like decysin 1, neudesin neurotrophic factor, MMP19, apolipoprotein L6, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)8, basic, immunoglobulin-like variable motif containing and CXCL16. These are of particular interest because they encode secreted proteins hence represent potential blood biomarkers for the early detection of malignant transformation in both scenarios. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, an important therapeutic target in melanoma treatment, was also upregulated in both comparisons indicating a potential involvement in immune tolerance, not only at advanced stages but also during the early transformation to melanoma.

Survival under deteriorated condition can be considered as the final consequence of a previous set of complementary morphophysiological and behavioral processes in adult fishes. Millerichthys robustus is the only annual fish that has developed an annual life history in North America wherewith allow us to consider it as an emerging model for annual killifishes to review, analyze and integrate the knowledge about its reproductive biology involved in allowing the embryos in diapause to survive face the hostile environmental condition. First, we review developmental ecology of Millerichthys embryos throughout different periods (flood, drought and humid) of the annual life cycle showing the possible developmental trajectories in situ. We then analyze: (i) the way in which embryos achieve survive drought from protective cortical structures (perivitelline space and egg envelope) that present dynamic changes according to the conditions to which they are exposed buffering the harmful effects of high temperatures and water loss. (ii) The nature and origin of these protective structures during the ovogenesis (cortical alveoli and zona pellucida give rise to the perivitelline space and egg envelope respectively and oil droplets represent an emergency nutritional reserve). (iii) Sexual synchronization through secretion of pheromones and the reproductive behavior that allows them to spawn under the substrate. Embryonic survival is achieved by success of simplest interactions between reproductive biology elements prior to embryo development.;diapause dynamics | egg envelope | fertilization | oogenesis | reproductive behavior | zona pellucida;3;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;CONACYT;375928;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The occurrence of adverse reactions (ADRs) to CBZ can negatively impact the quality of life of patients, as well as increase health-care costs. Thus, knowledge of CBZ-induced ADRs is important to achieve safer treatment outcomes. Areas covered: This review describes the clinical features, known mechanisms, and clinical management of the main CBZ-induced ADRs. In addition, pharmacogenetic studies focused on ADRs induced by CBZ are cited. Expert commentary: CBZ-induced ADRs are well known in the literature. The metabolite CBZ-10,11-epoxide plays an important role in the mechanism that underlies the ADRs induced by CBZ. Several factors should be considered for a safer use of CBZ, such as monotherapy prescription when possible, an adequate dose titration, knowledge of previous ADRs in the patient, and routine monitoring of CBZ plasma concentrations in symptomatic patients. Pharmacogenetics is a potential tool for CBZ therapy improvement, and the design of multicenter studies focused on the identification of biomarkers for CBZ-induced ADRs could provide useful information for a safer CBZ therapy.;Adverse drug reactions | carbamazepine | hepatotoxicity | hypersensitivity | hyponatremia | Stevens-Johnson syndrome | teratogenesis | toxic epidermal necrolysis;36;0;;;FONACYT;167261;Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Galphimia glauca has been used for many years in Mexican traditional medicine for treating mental diseases. From this plant, some compounds, denominated galphimines, have been discovered and have shown to possess the ability of modifying the frequency of discharge of dopaminergic neurons in the Ventral tegmental area. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect produced by the G. glauca extract, a Galphimine rich fraction (GRF), as well as the pure galphimines (G-A, G-B, and G-E) on behavioral models in mice. Products obtained from G. glauca were evaluated in the Haloperidol-induced catalepsy test and in the acute schizophrenia-like symptoms-induced with Ketamine (KET) in mice. Catalepsy was evaluated through the bar test, and schizophrenia-like symptoms, by means of the Open Field Test (OFT), Passive Avoidance Test (PAT), and the Forced Swimming Test (FST). The methanolic extract from G. glauca, GRF, and the pure galphimines were able to interact with the dopaminergic pathway and modify the behavioral response such as to potentiate the cataleptic effect induced with Haloperidol and to inhibit the behavior induced by KET in mice exposed to OFT, and FST. Moreover, the G. glauca extract and GRF were capable of blocking the cognitive decline that was induced with KET in mice (evaluated by PAT). Based on these results, it is possible to assume that part of the effect of G. glauca is due to the interaction of Galphimines with the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems in vivo. It can be concluded that the products obtained from G. glauca potentiate the cataleptic effect induced with Haloperidol and show a protector effect on some of the symptoms generated by KET in mice (KET is capable of provoking halucinations in humans and psychosis-like behaviour in mice). With this basis, the metanolic extract from G. glauca, and the GRF are capable of blocking positive and cognitive symptoms associated with psychosis induced by KET. In addition, it could be suggested that the galphimines are responsible for the inhibition of the positive symptoms observed.;Antipsychotic | Dopamine | Galphimia glauca | Ketamine | Malpighiaceae | NMDA | Nor-seco-triterpenes;8;0;;;CONACYT;267252;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Approximately 3.0 g/100 mL of agave fructans promoted a positive effect on thermal properties for both types of formulation, showing a significantly lower (P < 0.05) fraction of frozen water. The highest concentration of agave fructans resulted in the highest percentage of non-frozen water (P < 0.05). The addition of agave fructans led to a significantly higher (P < 0.05) glass transition temperature. Glass transition incited a change in heat capacity as moisture and agave fructans increased. Agave fructans had the ability to reduce the number and formation of ice crystals, and hence the melting temperature of ice cream. The samples with longer melting time resulted in a reduction of energy, showing low enthalpy values. The quantity of agave fructans used as fat and sugar replacer affected the infrared spectroscopy spectra, and led to an increase in the magnitude of the bands, especially in the O-H group that corresponds to polymeric hydrogen bonding between agave fructans and water.;;15;0;;;CONACYT;IT201417;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

A total of 16 female patients and 12 age-matched healthy female subjects were enrolled in a passive 70° head-up tilt test. Also, 12 age-matched healthy male subjects were enrolled to study gender differences. Analysis was performed dynamically using various short-term (5 min) windows shifted by 1 min as well as by 20 min of orthostatic phase (OP) to evaluate local and global complexity. Complexity was determined over multiple time scales by the established method of refined composite multiscale entropy (RCMSE) and by a new proposed method of multiscale entropy based on symbolic dynamics (MSE-SD). Concerning heart rate variability (HRV) during OP, both methods revealed the highest complexity for female controls followed by lower complexity in male controls (p < 0.01) and by the lowest complexity in female patients (p < 0.01). For blood pressure variability (BPV), no gender differences in controls were shown by any method. However, MSE-SD demonstrated highly significantly increased BPV complexity in patients during OP (p < 0.01 on 4 time-scales after 7 min, p < 0.001 on 5 time-scales after 11 min) while RCMSE did not reveal considerable differences (p < 0.05 on 2 time scales after 7 min). Respiratory complexity was further increased in patients primary shown by MSE-SD. Findings indicated impaired autonomic regulation in VVS patients characterized by predominantly increased BPV complexity accompanied with decreased HRV complexity. In addition, results suggested extending the concept of complexity loss with disease.;Cardiovascular complexity | multiscale entropy | orthostatic stress | symbolic dynamics | vasovagal syncope;12;0;;;;undefined;

Materials and methods: EP/AgNPs were synthesized using methanol/water bark extract of E. polystachya and characterized using various physicochemical techniques. Results: Immersion of adult zebrafish in 111 mM glucose solution resulted in a sustained hyperglycemic, hyperlipidemic state, and serum insulin levels decreased. The synthesized EP/AgNPs showed an absorption peak at 413 nm on ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, revealing the surface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that most of the particles were spherical, with a diameter of 10–12 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.197, and a zeta potential of -32.25 mV, suggesting high stability of the nanoparticles. EP/AgNPs promote pancreatic β-cell survival, insulin secretion, enhanced hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia in glucose-induced diabetic zebrafish. EP/AgNPs also showed protection of the pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury.

The adherence of E faecium UAM1 to human Caco-2 cells (around 20%) was significantly higher than that obtained with the P. pentosaceus strains (2%–5%) and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 (6%). The overall results indicate that E. faecium UAM1, has probiotic properties that predict its capability to colonize in competition with pathogens in the intestinal tract.

Energy consumed in excess of an individuaĺs requirements can contribute to the development of overweight and obesity, and to the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. There is a drive to improve the “healthiness” of traditional foods such as tamales. In turn, this motivates the need of evaluating the physicochemical transformations occurring during tamales preparation. This work studies the effect of using pork lard (AF) and hydrogenated vegetable shortening (VF) on the physicochemical properties and digestibility of tamales, as both type of fats are used in artisanal and mechanized production. VF imparts better viscoelastic properties to masa and better textural properties to tamales than AF. Both types of fat participate in the formation of amylose-lipid inclusion complexes, but higher resistant starch (RS) contents occur with VF than for AF, and are reflected in lower digestibility rates. An increase in readily digestible starch fraction is also detected, and is of about 40% when using AF. Both fats negatively effect the digestibility of protein. The results show that the fat type determines the digestibility properties of tamales.;animal and vegetable fats | physicochemical properties | resistant starch | starch and protein digestibility | tamales;4;0;;;;undefined;

Differences in spatial and temporal gamete development and reproductive patterns of three widespread scleractinian corals of this region—Pocillopora damicornis (branching colony morphology, characterized as hermaphrodite broadcaster), Pavona gigantea (massive colonies, characterized as gonochoric broadcaster/sequential co-sexually hermaphroditic) and Porites panamensis (encrusting colonies, characterized as gonochoric brooder)—were evaluated at local and regional scales across the ETP. This area extended from the Gulf of California (24°N) to the southern coast of Ecuador (–1°S), including offshore islands, using existing data pooled from prior studies. Predictive models were employed based on environmental variables: sea surface temperature, daylight hours, diffuse attenuation co-efficient at 490 nm and photosynthetically active radiation. Datasets were extracted from satellite images (https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov) and analysed using WAM_STATIST ver. 6.33® software to obtain monthly average data from each site. The spatial (region, sub-region and site) and seasonal (wet, dry) variation in reproductive activity (% colonies with gametes) differed among the three species; significant interactions were season × sub-region for P. damicornis, season × site (sub-region) for P. gigantea, and season × site for P. panamensis, for which sub-region was not considered as a factor. The predictive models also suggest that gamete production/maturation of P. damicornis and P. gigantea is influenced by local differences in sea surface temperature and daylight hours. Porites panamensis was not correlated with any environmental variable examined. Variations in local and regional reproductive developmental patterns are likely an acclimatization response by each species imposed by the timing and duration of local stressor events. This analysis has provided insights into the diverse local and regional physical drivers that affect species responses and acclimatization in sexual reproduction across the ETP.";environmental variables | gamete development | Pavona | Pocillopora | Porites;11;0;;;NSF;P/ PIFI‐2010‐14MSU0010Z‐10;National Science Foundation

In this configuration, two parallel plasmas are produced ablating simultaneously two different targets, V and Ag, to form the Ag-modified vanadium oxide thin films. The ablation of the vanadium target is performed under constant conditions in all deposits, while the silver produced plasma is varied. The effect of the amount of Ag incorporated in the films on their compositional, morphological, structural, and photocatalytic properties is studied. The results reveal that films with variable Ag content from 0.6 to 17.2 at. % are obtained. Depending on the silver content, the samples show very different surface morphologies from smooth surfaces to acicular structures in films containing Ag. Raman spectra reveal that as the silver content is increased different vanadium oxides coexist and at the highest Ag content a silver vanadate is formed. The photocatalytic activity for the degradation of the Malachite Green dye under simulated solar light is determined. It is found that in general terms, films containing silver show a higher photocatalytic response than V2O5 films alone.;Laser ablation | Photocatalysis | Thin films;0;0;;;CONACYT;CB-240998;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Little is known about the relationship between GIS and malnutrition in geriatric patients with ESRD. The main objective of this study was to determine the relationship between nutritional status and severity of GIS in geriatric patients on dialysis therapy. Clinically-stable geriatric patients (older than 60 years old) who were dialysis outpatients were included in this cross-sectional study. The severity of GIS was assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire (GSQ, short version), with patients classified into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe. Nutritional status was evaluated with the Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS), anthropometric assessment, biochemical parameters, and bioelectrical impedance. Descriptive statistics were used and differences between groups were analyzed with ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis, with a p < 0.05 considered to indicate significance. Fifty patients completed the study; the median age was 67 years old. Twenty-three patients were on hemodialysis (HD) and 27 were on peritoneal dialysis (PD). No significant differences were found according to dialysis modality, presence of diabetes, or gender. Ninety percent of patients had at least one GIS. Poorer nutritional status (evaluated by MIS) was related to a higher severity of GIS. There were no significant differences with other nutritional parameters. Our study showed a high prevalence of GIS in geriatric patients. There were no differences in observed GIS values that were attributed to dialysis modality, gender, or presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Severe GIS values were associated with poorer nutritional status determined by MIS, however, there was no association with anthropometry, biochemical values, or bioimpedance vector analysis.";Dialytic therapy | Gastrointestinal symptoms | Geriatric patients | Nutritional status;10;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In this study, we sought to determine the incidence, persistence and clearance of HPV infections in oral and oropharyngeal samples from HIV/AIDS subjects. Methods: A longitudinal, observational and analytical study was performed with an ongoing cohort of HIV/AIDS subjects in Mexico City (September 2013-February 2015). The study was approved by institutional committees, and demographic and clinical data were registered. At the baseline and three-month visits, oral examinations and cytobrush samples were obtained. DNA was purified, quantified and used to detect an HPV-L1 gene fragment by nested PCR, using MY09/MY11 and GP5 + /GP6 + primers. HPV DNA products were purified, sequenced and typed according to HPV databases. Risk factors were assessed, and a multivariate modelling approach was used to determine independent effects. Results: This study included 97 HIV/AIDS individuals (91% men [86.4% of which are men who have sex with men], median age: 36 years, 72.2% under HAART). From the baseline visit, HPV was observed in 55.7% (HR-HPV: 26.8%; HPV-18: 24.1%), with a higher HPV-positive samples for smokers (61.1 vs 32.6%, P =.005). The three-month overall HPV incidence was 33.9%; type-specific HPV persistence was 33.3% (HR-HPV: 13.3%); and 13 of the 33 (39.4%) baseline HPV-positive individuals cleared the infection (HR-HPV: 53.8%). Conclusions: Although HR-HPV persistence was low, and clearance of the infection was observed in most cases, a close follow-up is necessary, given the increase in HNC among HIV-subjects, particularly HPV-related cancer.";HIV/AIDS | human papillomavirus | oral cancer | persistence | tobacco;5;0;;;;undefined;

During CT, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are upregulated, causing damage in mucosal and submucosal tissues, and playing a key role in OM; therefore, the use of subantimicrobial doxycycline as a MMP inhibitor may represent a potential approach for OM management. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low doses of doxycycline in OM development in individuals with acute leukaemia (AL) during CT. Methods: Randomized controlled clinical trial (Registration No. NCT01087476) performed in adult AL patients scheduled to receive CT (September 2010-October 2014). Individuals were stratified by leukaemia type and assigned randomly to receive doxycycline hyclate (50 mg/d) (doxycycline group: DG) or placebo (placebo group: PG) before and during CT. Included subjects had a baseline oral examination and thereafter 3 times a week during 21 days. The primary outcome was OM development. Results and discussion: One hundred and forty-seven AL subjects were enrolled: 74 in DG and 73 in PG; baseline characteristics between groups were comparable. During follow-up, 15 (10.2%) individuals developed OM; no differences between treatment groups were found (DG:8.1%, PG:12.3%; P =.59). The mean OM Assessment Scale score was 2.51, without differences between groups (DG:2.7, PG:2.4; P =.65). Low baseline blood albumin levels in the OM-affected individuals were identified, revealing the effect of systemic deterioration as a predisposing factor for OM development. No adverse effects were observed.

In the present study, a group of cylindrical specimens of Gracilaria from the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, previously identified as G. cornea, was collected. Based on COI-5P and rbcL sequences, these samples formed an independent group closely related to G. ferox, a flat species. Morphologically, our specimens differed from G. ferox and the other species of Gracilaria by the presence of very small cystocarps and a thick pericarp composed of many layers of cells.

However, an equivalent viscous damping, that generates similar dynamic response of structures, is used for simplification purposes. Under such consideration, this paper presents the experimental measurements of damping on structures equipped with Buckling-Restrained Braces (BRBs) working within their linear-elastic range. For comparison purposes, tests were also conducted on bare structures (without BRBs) and on a structure fitted with a conventional brace. All the experiments were conducted on a shaking table. The results show that, while the test with conventional brace did not show increase of the damping ratio, BRBs significantly did. This happened even when both, the main structure and the BRBs, exhibited linear-elastic response. A model is proposed to account for the dissipative forces observed on the experiments. The findings of this study are significant as they show that BRBs start dissipating energy at low levels of displacement; and this energy dissipation must be taken into account in the context of performance-based seismic design, so that the dynamic response demands on such structures are estimated properly.";Buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) | Damping | Dynamic linear-elastic response | Shaking table experiments;18;0;;;UNAM;CJIC/CTIC/4939/2016;Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

All the strains were investigated for acid and bile tolerances, transit tolerance in simulated gastrointestinal conditions, for cell surface characteristics including hydrophobicity, co-aggregation and auto-aggregation, and for bile salt hydrolase activity. Moreover, haemolytic, gelatinase and biogenic amine-producing abilities were investigated for safety assessment. The strains were found to be tolerant at low pH (two strains at pH 2.0 and all the strains at pH 3.0). All of them could also survive in the presence of bile salts (0.3% oxgall) and in simulated gastric and intestinal juices conditions. Besides, three of them were found to harbour the gtf gene involved in pH and bile salt survival. The strains also showed remarkable cell surface characteristics, and 57.14% exhibited the ability to deconjugate bile salts. When assayed for their safety properties, the strains prove to be free from haemolytic activity, gelatinase activity and they could neither produce biogenic amines nor harbour the hdc gene. They did not also show antibiotic resistance, thus confirming to be safe for application as probiotics.

However, its activity profile may involve effects on excitatory and/or inhibitory neurotransmission since the primary target of LEV, synaptic vesicle protein 2A, is ubiquitously expressed in all types of synaptic vesicles. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to explore the effect of LEV (300 mg/kg/day for one week, administered via osmotic mini-pumps) on neurotransmitter release and its probable selective effect on extracellular gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), aspartate (Asp), glutamine (Gln), taurine (Tau) and glycine (Gly) concentrations (using in vivo microdialysis under basal and high-K+ conditions) in the dorsal hippocampus (DH), a region that undergoes major synaptic changes during epilepsy. Epileptic rats developed clear signs of hyperexcitability, i.e., an elevated Glu/GABA ratio in the DH. The LEV concentration in blood after 7 days of treatment was within the therapeutic range. In contrast, LEV was not detected four days after mini-pump removal (washout period). Furthermore, LEV restored the Glu/GABA ratio to approximately the control level and significantly increased the GABA concentration after the initiation of high-K+ conditions. Based on these data, LEV treatment restored the lost balance between the excitatory and inhibitory systems under basal conditions. Moreover, LEV showed a selective effect by preferentially increasing vesicular release of GABA, a mechanism by which LEV could reduce epileptic seizures.;Amino acids | Dorsal hippocampus | Levetiracetam | Microdialysis assay | Temporal lobe epilepsy;14;0;;;IPN;INP-064/2015;Instituto Politécnico Nacional

In addition, we assessed the participation of both estrogen and progestin receptors in the lordosis behavior induced by G1 in ovariectomized (OVX), E2-benzoate (EB)-primed rats. In Experiment 1, icv injection of G1 induced lordosis behavior at 120 and 240 min. In Experiment 2, icv injection of the GPER-1 antagonist G15 significantly reduced lordosis behavior induced by either G1 or free E2. In addition, Antide, a GnRH-1 receptor antagonist, significantly depressed G1 facilitation of lordosis behavior in OVX, EB-primed rats. Similarly, icv injection of Antide blocked the stimulatory effect of E2 on lordosis behavior. In Experiment 3, systemic injection of either tamoxifen or RU486 significantly reduced lordosis behavior induced by icv administration of G1 in OVX, EB-primed rats. The results suggest that GnRH release activates both estrogen and progestin receptors and that this activation is important in the chain of events leading to the display of lordosis behavior in response to activation of GPER-1 in estrogen-primed rats.;Antide | Estradiol | G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 | G1 | G15 | GnRH | Lordosis | RU486 | Tamoxifen;6;0;;;CONACYT;DSA/103.5/16/12094;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Three cultivars of maize (a tri-linear HS2 hybrid, the single-cross hybrid Triunfo and the native Cacahuacintle) were evaluated with three P. agglomerans isolates. In the three maize cultivars, chlorotic streaks appeared on new leaves; at the ripening stage, the symptoms were less perceptible. The average incidence of plants with chlorotic streaks was higher in the town of Temamatla than in Ayapango, and in both microenvironments, the average degree of severity was less than 40%. Isolate A was the most virulent (P < 0.0001) on the three cultivars evaluated.

Goodea atripinnis is an omnivorous fish that is only found in the state of Aguascalientes. Its population is being drastically reduced and its survival is considered to be threatened. To avoid its extinction, ex situ breeding programs are being implemented. To implement these programs, however, it is necessary to have feeding plans that allow the nutritional needs of this species to be met. Goals. To evaluate the effects of different protein levels in the diet (25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 % PC) on the growth of G. atripinnis. Methods. A randomized complete-block design with five treatments (protein levels) and 3 aquariums per treatment was used, each aquarium containing 20 fish. The experiment lasted 150 days. Daily feed intake and changes in weight and length of each fish were recorded every 15 days. Results. We found differences in final weight and total weight gain (p <0.05) depended on protein levels. Both the growth rate and the total food intake increased with higher levels of protein. As a result, the feed conversion rate, protein efficiency, and Fulton (K) body condition factor improved. The Gompertz model showed that high protein levels increased standard weight and that the inflection point occurred at the same weight. Conclusions. With higher protein levels, the standard weight is reached at an earlier age, leading to greater development of the fish.;Feed conversion Rate | Gompertz model | Protein efficiency ratio;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Chirostoma humboldtianum (Valenciennes, 1835) is the first ichthyic species scientifically described in Mexico. Diversification processes of the genus Chirostoma Swaison, 1839 are related to the specialization of its mandibular apparatus; yet few studies exist regarding the digestive system in Atherinopsidae. In particular, the anatomical aspects of its mandibular, branchial, and hyoid skeleton, mandibular and pharyngeal dentition, and visceral musculature are superficially described. Goals. Analyze and describe the general organization of the digestive system of Chirostoma humboldtianum as part of its basic biology, in order to reveal the feeding processes useful for its conservation or culture. Methods. Adult specimens, previously fixed with formaldehyde and preserved in ethyl alcohol, were obtained. Their visceral skeleton and musculature and digestive tract were analyzed by dissections. Results. Major characteristics include presence of lower interpharyngeal cartilage, extensive expansion of levator operculi muscle over external opercular surface; presence of tendinous complex of A1 section of the adductor mandibulae muscle, which relates this section with the lacrimal and anguloarticular bones; presence of an additional section of pharyngoclavicularis externus muscle; insertion of retractor dorsalis muscle in vertebrae 2 to 4, absence of a stomach; and presence of a dental plate in each ceratobranchial 4. Conclusions. The organization of the digestive system of C. humboldtianum corresponds to the Atherinomorpha anatomic pattern, because of the absence of a stomach, among other characteristics; it particularly corresponds to the Atherinopsidae anatomical pattern due to its visceral skeleton organization. This organization, in particular, of the mandibular and pharyngeal adult dentition is characteristic of a carnivorous fish that includes other teleosts in its diet.";Buccopharyngeal cavity | Dentition | Digestive tube | Visceral musculature | Visceral skeleton;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Most growth analyses of Yellowtail Snapper neglect consideration of model and parameter uncertainty. Goals. In this paper, we explore model uncertainty using three models (von Bertalanffy, logistic, and Gompertz) as well as the Akaike criterion for model selection. We also estimate growth parameters and its uncertainty using the maximum likelihood estimation approach (under different assumptions of error variance) and Bayesian methods. Methods. Models were fitted to length-at-age data from organisms caught in Antón Lizardo, Veracruz. Regarding the Bayesian methods, a prior distribution for the asymptotic length was built based on data gathered from literature. We used Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) methods to fit the logistic model. Results. The Akaike criterion results suggest that the logistic model provided the best fit for the observed data (lowest AIC = 31.4). Parameter estimates included asymptotic length (L∞= 64.9 ± 5.43), growth rate (K = 0.49 ± 0.07), and age at the curve inflection point (I = 3.28 ± 0.42). Regarding the Bayesian analysis, MCMC simulations suggest that the most probable value for the asymptotic length was 64.3 cm with an interval of 95% probability (58.7,70.1). The most probable value for the growth rate was 0.48 with an interval of 95% probability (0.42, 0.55). Last, the most probable value for the age at the curve inflection point was 1.7 years with a range of 95% probability (1.31, 2.16). Conclusions. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and the Bayesian framework should be considered basic statistical techniques in the evaluation of individual growth of the species of interest, as they provide a robust analysis of available information of the species and the opportunity to incorporate such analysis to sustainable management practices.;Bayesian estimation | Growth | Likelihood | Ocyurus chrysurus | Veracruz;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Oncorhynchus mykiss is a species that is widely cultivated in the world with high economic value. For this reason, it is essential to optimize its growth and reproduction for aquaculture. Goals. Evaluate the growth and sperm quality of rainbow trout during the reproductive season. Methods. We conducted research at the ""El Zarco"" Aquaculture Center in the state of Mexico, with 32 sexually mature three-year-old males. Once a month, we recorded total length, height, thickness (cm), and weight (g) during July-February, and calculated weight gain (WG), absolute growth rate (AGR), and instantaneous growth rate (IGR). Semen samples were obtained during (August-February). In order to evaluate the spermatic quality, we measured volume, color, consistency, concentration, pH, and mobility. Results. The highest AGR, WG, and IGR in terms of length and weight were obtained from July-August, i.e., a month prior to the reproductive period; from August-February the AGR was 1.13 cm, WG was 0.01 g, and there was an average IGR of 0.0321 ± 0.0522 cm and 0.0932 ± 0.2223 g. Differences (p <0.05) in length and weight were found between July and the months of the reproductive period. There was a pattern of semen production: It increased from August to October and then decreased until February, with significant differences (p <0.05). Usually, white semen and milky consistency were found. The highest sperm concentration occurred in September (8.17 ± 2.06 x 109 mL-1) and decreased until February, with significant differences (p <0.05) between months. The pH was alkaline with an average value of 8.07 ± 0.31. Mobility increased from August to December and decreased from January to February, with significant differences (p <0.05) between months. Conclusions. During the reproductive period, food energy is channeled to ensure reproduction, so that growth slows and sperm quality varies during the reproductive months.";Color | Consistency | Motility | PH | Rainbow trout | Semen production | Size | Sperm concentration | Weight;1;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Low vitality is a recurrent problem in veterinary perinatology, and several factors can directly or indirectly culminate in neonatal death. One prime determinant of low vitality in animals is foetal hypoxia resulting from prolonged labour or dystocia. Factors such as foetal acidosis, metabolic and electrolyte imbalances, and asphyxia can quickly lead to neonatal death, while others are a consequence of low vitality in which the weak neonate cannot reach the teat and feed, thermoregulate, or breathe because of airway obstruction by meconium. Neonatal hypoxia can also lead to a failure of passive transfer and neonatal infections. The birth weight, the age of the dam, the size of the litter, and parity are also relevant vitality determinants. Scoring systems, similar to the Apgar score used with human babies, have been modified in veterinary neonatology to identify low vitality neonates in need of medical intervention. This review focuses on the vitality assessments and risk factors associated with neonatal mortality in puppies, calves and piglets. Also reviewed is the relationship of umbilical cord morphology and hypoxia with the premature passing of meconium into the amniotic sac and subsequent aspiration into the lungs.

Using these active peptides decreases the use of chemical products, and allows the revaluation of protein byproducts generated by some industries. Microbial proteases are advantageous because microorganisms have a wide repertoire of biochemical tools, can be produced in less time and smaller spaces, with minimum nutritional requirements, and are susceptible to genetic modification.

With the increased interest in domestic farm animal welfare from both the political and societal agendas, environmental enrichment (EE) is becoming an interesting solution, offering an alternative not only to optimize the welfare of the animals but to improve the animals’ performance. In general, the development of more intensive production systems and specialized techniques has provided benefits in terms of productivity, but at the expense of the behavioural needs and welfare of kept animals. In intensive farming, welfare concerns are still often related to barren environments and crowded conditions. Producers need to balance the requirements to improve welfare conditions on the farm with practical considerations. This paper provides a review of the scientific literature, focusing on recent advances on the welfare-relevant consequences of EE on harmful social behaviours due to intensively farmed confinement in pigs, laying hens and dairy calves, including a discussion with regard to their relevance and suitability.;Abnormal behaviour | Aggressive behaviour | Cross-suckling | Environmental enrichment | Feather pecking | Frustration | Tail-biting | Welfare conditions;14;0;;;;undefined;

Temperature evaluations were performed with an infrared thermal thermography camera in the eyes, the thorax and the scrotal area, at 24 h before castration (RV), immediately after castration (PC), 24 and 48 h post-surgery. The study also evaluated plasma glucose and lactate concentrations. The thorax presented lower infrared temperature in the groups C1I13 and C2I13 than those in C1I5 and C2I5 (p<0.05). Regardless of age and type of castration, plasma lactate values increased PC (P=0.0001). The piglets castrated at 5 days of age were less susceptible to presenting temperature changes regardless of the number of incisions, while the animals castrated at 13 days with two incisions showed lower temperatures and imbalances in plasma glucose and lactate concentrations. Castration in piglets of 13 days causes a decrease in temperature in the lacrimal caruncle immediately after performing surgery.

Firstly, we provide a brief explanation on the anatomy and how olfaction is modulated. In particular, we discuss the literature in the context of recent trends in main olfactory epithelium and vomeronasal organ functions, briefly explaining the main differences between the anatomical olfactory structures of various domestic animals. Subsequently, examples of animal welfare implications of diet selection, predation, aversion, breeding and mother-young bonding behaviours are described. An ethological view of olfaction in addition to the brain structure and olfaction morphology aspects has been covered, as it offers a promising approach in the welfare of mammalian species under our care. We conclude that the knowledge of the roles played by olfaction in chemical communication may help improving housing conditions, fulfilment of feeding requirements, handling and breeding of companion, farm and zoo mammals, and promote the development of appropriate social, sexual, parental and feeding behaviours thus enhancing animal welfare.";Animal welfare | Carnivores | Feeding behaviour | Maternal behaviour | Olfaction | Sexual behaviour | Social behaviour | Ungulates | Vomeronasal organ;11;0;;;;undefined;

The identification methods for this group are based on evaluating the expression of phenotypic characteristics such as the ability to metabolize various substrates; however, this is disadvantageous as these methods are dependent on gene expression. In recent years, genotyping methods such as the Multiple Locus Variable-Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) and gene identification have been useful for epidemiological study of several bacterial species. To develop a genotyping method, the genome sequence of Staphylococcus chromogenes MU970 was analysed. The analysis showed nine virulence genes described in Staphylococcus aureus. The MLVA was developed using four loci identified in the genome of S. chromogenes MU970. This genotyping method was examined in 23 strains of CNS isolated from goat mastitis. The rate of discrimination for MLVA was 0.8893, and the highest rates of discrimination per the index of Simpson and Hunter-Gaston were 0.926 and 0.968 for the locus 346_06, respectively. The virulence genes were present in all strains of S. chromogenes but not in other CNS. The genotyping method presented in this paper is a viable and easy method for typifying CNS isolates from mastitis cases in different regions and is an ideal mean of tracking this disease.";Genotyping | Mastitis in goats | MLVA | Staphylococcus chromogenes | VNTR;3;1;repositoryam;Green;UAM;undefined;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

The lambs were divided by age into the following three groups: 15 days (G 1 = 40 lambs), 30 days (G 2 = 40 lambs) and 60 days (G 3 = 40 lambs). The hypothesis to be tested was that breaking the ewe-lamb bond at different ages and for these brief time periods will cause significant metabolic changes in the lambs. To this end, blood samples were taken from the three test groups 24 h before separation to establish reference values (RVs), and again at the end of the three separation times. The following blood variables were analysed for all three study groups: glucose (mg/dL), lactate (mg/dL), calcium (Ca 2+, mmol/L), sodium (Na +, mmol/L), potassium (K +, mmol/L), haematocrit (HTC, %), pCO 2 (mmHg), pO 2 (mmHg), HCO 3 - (mmol/L) and pH. Results showed that the G 1 lambs suffered the greatest metabolic changes for the variables pO 2, pCO 2, glucose, lactate, pH, HCO 3 -, Ca 2+, Na +, K + and HCT. With respect to time, the first 10 min of separation from the mother induced marked metabolic changes in the 15-, 30- and 60-day-old lambs, but, at 60 min, the G 2 and G 3 lambs tended to recover their physiological RVs, while the G 1 lambs did not. These findings showed that breaking the ewe-lamb bond immediately generated metabolic changes in the lambs even though they remained in a familiar, habitual environment. They also indicated that the age of the lambs at separation was a significant factor, as the older animals tended to re-establish their RVs after the metabolic changes, likely because their physiological compensating mechanisms are more efficient, or perhaps because the intensity of attachment to the mother decreases with greater age.;animal welfare | blood profle | physiological response | stress | weaning;4;0;;;;undefined;

Although an early diagnosis can achieve tumor eradication with appropriate treatments, failure of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy still represents a major issue for complete elimination of tumor cells, and therefore, research on new strategies for cancer therapy is encouraged. One of these alternatives is the use of liveattenuated bacteria with antitumor properties. Among the different types of bacteria analyzed as possible antitumor agents, Salmonella enterica has been the most studied. Although Salmonella enterica tumor selectivity remains unclear, pre-clinical and clinical trials have shown its localization in solid, semi-solid and metastatic tumors. Once in the tumor microenvironment, these attenuated bacteria have the ability to induce or activate the innate or specific antitumor immune response, and the potential to be used as a Trojan horse to kill tumor cells by carrying cytotoxic molecules, pro-apoptotic proteins, immunomodulatory molecules, or transferring DNA into eukaryotic cells in a process called bactofection.

Six-week-old UN and WN Han-Wistar rats were treated with TMP-SMX at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg/d TMP and 50 mg/kg/d SMX for 5 or 10 days. Blood was collected from the tail vein one day before (day −1) and 15, 30, and 45 days after TMP-SMX administration. The Pig-a mutant frequencies (MFs) in peripheral blood reticulocytes (RETs) and erythrocytes (RBCs) were measured through flow cytometry. Severe malnutrition increased the basal MFs in RETs (RET CD59-) and RBC (RBCs CD59-). These findings support the hypothesis that severe malnutrition is mutagenic even in the absence of exposure to an exogenous mutagen.

Glaucophyte plastids are unique among archaeplastidians due to the presence of a vestigial peptidoglycan wall and the accumulation of RuBisCO in the stroma that resembles cyanobacterial carboxysomes. These ancestral traits, typically observed in cyanobacteria, have led to suggestions that glaucophytes are the earliest branching Archaeplastida lineage. Plastid phylogenomic surveys recover Glaucophyta as the earliest-diverging branch, but tree topology tests have not rejected the placement of red algae or viridiplants as the first splitting group. Resolving the branching history of the primary plastids might rely on both the implementation of phylogenetic methods that cope better with systematic errors and further expansion of the taxonomic sampling. The paucity of the Glaucophyta genome data has been a limitation when contrasting different hypotheses about the diversification of the Archaeplastida. The plastome of Cyanophora paradoxa was the only available from Glaucophyta for almost 20 years, until recently when plastomes of Glaucocystis, Cyanoptyche, and Gloeochaete and other Cyanophora species were sequenced. Comparative analyses show that the plastid gene repertoire of glaucophytes is highly conserved, and that the size and gene content of their plastomes do not differ drastically from those of other archaeplastidians. In fact, in terms of gene content, red algal plastomes are likely more similar to the repertoire of the ancestral primary plastid. Studies of plastomes have expanded our perspective about the diversity within Glaucophyta, but such studies are still based on limited taxonomic samples. The further inclusion of data from novel glaucophyte taxa will be critical to obtain more solid answers about the evolution and diversity of these rare algae.;Archaeplastida | Cyanophora | Glaucocystis | Glaucophyta | HGT | Plastid | Plastid genome;4;0;;;;undefined;

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a pragmatic strategy aimed to improve physician PA counseling and patient PA. An effectiveness-implementation type-2 hybrid design was used to evaluate a 3-h training (i.e., implementation strategy-IS) to increase physician use of the 5-As (assess, advise, agree, assist, arrange) for PA counseling (i.e., clinical intervention-CI) and to determine if the CI improved patient PA. Patients of trained and untrained physicians reported on PA and quality of life pre-post intervention. Medical charts (N = 1700) were examined to assess the proportion of trained physicians that used the 5-As. The RE-AIM framework informed our evaluation. 305/322 of eligible physicians participated in the IS (M age = 40 years, 52% women) and 683/730 of eligible patients in the CI (M age = 49 years, 77% women). The IS was adopted by all state regions and cost ~ $20 Mexican pesos (US$1) per provider trained. Physician adoption of any of the 5-As improved from pre- to post-training (43 vs. 52%, p < .01), with significant increases in the use of assessment (43 vs. 52%), advising (25 vs. 39%), and assisting with barrier resolution (7 vs. 15%), but not in collaborative goal setting (13 vs. 17%) or arranging for follow-up (1 vs. 1%). Patient PA and quality of life did not improve. The IS intervention was delivered with high fidelity at a low cost, but appears to be insufficient to lead to broad adoption of the CI.;Behavior change | Lifestyle medicine | RE-AIM | Translation research;9;0;repositoryvor;Green;NIGMS;U54GM115458;National Institute of General Medical Sciences

There exists a variety of ecotypes that have not been characterized and their adequate selection process, according to their strongest functional characteristics, will allow the establishment of improvement programs for this genetic resource. The object of this study was the chemical characterization and the determination of the in vitro and in vivo antioxidant capacity of 7 Spondias purpurea L. ecotypes. Differences were observed in the antioxidant capacity and the content of functional compounds among all the ecotypes analyzed. A high total phenolic content and a low flavonoid and carotenoid content were found, both in the epicarp and in the pulp. In each ecotype, the hydrophilic phase presented up to 40 times greater antioxidant capacity compared to the lipophilic phase. The hydrophilic phase of the epicarp of “Costeña Tierra Colorada” had the greatest antioxidant capacity and highest total phenolic content, whereas “Jocote” presented the lowest antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content. A positive correlation was observed between phenol levels and the antioxidant capacity in the epicarp. Regarding antioxidant activity in vivo, it was observed that in all analyzed concentrations of hydrophilic extracts of the epicarp of “Costeña Tierra Colorada” and in the highest “Jocote” concentrations, they provided thermo-protection against heat stress as well as a general well-being to the worm as evidenced by their high mobility.;antioxidant capacity | Caenorhabditis elegans | functional compounds | Spondias purpurea L;13;0;;;;undefined;

Environmental cues may influence expression of the diapause phenotype during embryonic incubation. Millerichthys robustus is the only annual killifish distributed in North America. The aim of this review is to analyze the ecology of M. robustus development and contrast this with that of annual killifishes in austral locations. The temporary water bodies inhabited by M. robustus present the following environmental conditions: flood, drought, and humidity. During the flooding period, the environment presents the lowest temperatures, shortest photoperiod, and highest precipitation, and embryos were found in diapause I. The drought period features the highest temperatures and lowest precipitation, and embryos were found in diapause II. In contrast, during the humid period at the beginning of the rainy season, embryos were found in diapause I, II, and III, associated with the longer photoperiod and high temperatures. These dynamics of the diapause phenotypes can be explained by a combination of the strategies of phenotypic plasticity during flood and drought periods, and bet-hedging during the humid period. Moreover, the microenvironmental conditions in which embryos were buried could influence developmental trajectories.

This research describes, for the first time, changes in cortical structures during three diapause stages in embryos of annual fish M. robustus during an annual life cycle. Embryos were collected in three periods through the year in a temporal water body: flood, drought and wet. During flood period all embryos were found in diapause I (during epiboly, dispersion of the blastomeres stage) with maximum thickness in all cortical structures and presence of egg envelope filaments. During drought period all embryos were in diapause II (development during somitogenesis, before the organogenesis) and its structures reduced its thickness significantly and lost the egg envelope filaments. Interestingly, embryos in diapause II and III (embryonic development completed in a pre hatching stage) were found during wet period (an example of bet-hedging strategy) in which all structures presented a recovery tending to its original condition observed during flood period. This research demonstrates that annual fish embryos respond to their exposure to seasonal environmental variations with dynamic structural changes that are fundamental for their survival.;Annual fish embryos | Annualism | Chorion | Egg envelope | Periviteline space;4;0;;;;undefined;

For that purpose, membrane autopsies were carried out based on fouling layer density determination, thermogravimetric, SEM and EDX analysis. Results showed a variable density of the fouling layer (average values were 13.90 ± 0.22, 13.46 ± 1.15 and 12.78 ± 0.49 mg/cm2 for HRT of 4, 8 and 12 h, respectively), indicating that this parameter had an impact on the fouling density. Organic material was predominant in the fouling layer, being around 75% of its composition for the three HRT studied. Regarding pore-blocking mechanisms, standard blocking was the predominant mechanism at the beginning of filtration, coexisting at the end of it with cake filtration. In the first filtration cycle (1 h), after standard blocking, intermediate and complete blocking developed simultaneously during a short period of time and, finally, cake filtration prevailed. However, in the last (19th) filtration cycle, standard blocking and cake filtration occurred simultaneously from the beginning, suggesting the existence of an irreversible fouling layer, in spite of chemical cleaning.;Fouling layer density | Irreversible fouling | Pore blocking mechanisms;5;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;083679;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

To achieve this goal, a free word association task was applied. A total of 549 consumers participated in this study. Participants were divided into two conditions, in which the inductor expressions for the free word association task changed: (a) food products made with flowers and (b) yoghurt made with flowers. Results showed a very positive attitude to both situations, and consumers associated Food products made with flowers to “health care” while the central core of yoghurt made with flowers reflected the innovative condition of this product, supported here by their unpredictable character (information generated).;Attitude | Consumer | Edible flowers | Social representation | Unfamiliar food | Word association;49;0;;;CAPES;undefined;Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

Human systems include a sensory system to perceive the surrounding world, an affective system that evokes emotional responses to certain stimuli, and a cognitive system that makes meaning and processes information. We hypothesise that experience is a combination between these three systems rather than a linear continuum of hedonic reactions. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted a study measuring the experience of drinking craft and industrial beers. A total of 400 consumers were invited to drink beer, rate their liking and select a set of phrases that better described their drinking experience. Results showed no significant difference in expected liking and purchase intention between the eight beers evaluated. However, a difference between beers was observed for the CATA phrases. Cognitive phrases were more frequently checked for craft beers, while sensory, and affective phrases were more frequently checked for industrial beers. A Multiple Factor Analysis for Contingency Tables showed that the sensory and cognitive systems were more related to liking than the affective system.;Affects | Beer | Cognition | Product experience | Senses;29;0;;;;undefined;

In recent years, a change of consumption has been noticed in several countries with an increase in interest for traditional and craft products. This is the case, for example, for the beer sector, going from a beer category dominated by one style to a wider range of options of industrial beers and to less commercial options such as craft beers. A change in patterns of consumption is usually an indicator that the perception towards the product is changing. In this study, the objective is to understand the impact of gender (men versus women) and type of consumption (craft versus industrial beer) on mental beer representations. Four groups of participants were asked to visually sort a set of beer in the presence of brand and packaging. The results show both similarities and differences in the categorization made by each group of consumers. Overall, participants agreed more on their categorization of industrial beers than they did with craft beers. Gender differences were perceived in the sorting task especially in terms of the number of groups used to sort beers, more groups in men; but also in the words used to describe beers. When comparing the results across women and men, it was seen that the latter sort the beers based on previous knowledge (cognitive dimension) while women rely more on the affective dimension (like – do not like) to sort the beers. An interaction effect was also found between gender and type of consumption which highlights the complex relationship that consumers have towards beers.";Beer | DISTATIS | Gender | Habits of consumption | Sorting task;19;0;;;;undefined;

The state of the pool can be divided into three periods: a flood period lasting from September to March when the pool was filled with water, a drought period from April to June when the pool was dry, and a humid period in July and August when the pool was intermittently filled. Soil substrate was examined in each of these three periods (flood, drought and humid), embryos were found, and the stage of embryonic diapause was determined. During the flood period embryos were in diapause I; during the drought period in diapause II; and during the humid period mainly in diapause III with a small subset in diapause II (an example of a bet-hedging strategy). Two hatching periods (separated by two weeks) were documented during the beginning of the flood period. Fish growth was analyzed in both males and females, with females showing an overall slower growth rate and smaller adult size. In females, ovarian maturity was characterized histologically to understand the reproductive cycle. The onset of sexual maturity began during the third week after hatching (21 days) with the presence of secondary sexual characteristics in females and the beginning of Secondary Growth Stage in some ovarian follicles. All stages of oogenesis, postovulatory follicles and ovulated oocytes were observed from the fourth week post hatching (28 days) until death. M. robustus appears to exhibit similar patterns of embryonic diapause compared to other annual killifish living in seasonal water bodies closer to the equator. This study characterizes (for the first time) the adaptations and life cycle of M. robustus. This information could be useful to evaluate the potential risk of these populations and, if necessary, to develop plans for their conservation.";Annualism | Diapause | Growth | Life cycle | Oogenesis | Reproductive cycle;12;0;;;;undefined;

Data were analysed through the Mann Whitney test and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Socioeconomic and farm variables influenced the use of cultivated grassland, as observed in Group 1. This group showed a bigger proportion of farmers (60 %) who indicated a positive intention to use cultivated grasslands, in comparison with 36 % of farmers from Group 2. Farmers from both groups perceived similarly the utility and importance of the use of cultivated grassland; however, farmers' intention of Group 1 showed a significant correlation (P<0.05) with utility and importance. Other factors influencing the use of cultivated grasslands were the positive beliefs, social referents and difficulties perceived of the innovation.

Coupling TiO2 with other semiconductor oxides provided excellent results in decreasing recombination by transferring one of the charge carriers to another oxide. These photogenerated charge carriers play key roles in the reduction and oxidation process in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Nevertheless, even if the (e−-h+) are separated, the reaction cannot happen without proper active sites. So, co-catalysts are needed to improve the reduction and oxidation process on the surface of photocatalyst. RESULTS: The hydrogen production of SnO2@TiO2 structure with CuO and CoO co-catalysts (1 wt% of co-catalyst: 1Co-ST, 1Cu-ST and 1Co-1Cu-ST) was studied under UV light, and characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, UV-vis reflectance diffuse, XPS and photoelectrochemical test. The dispersion of co-catalyst on the surface of ST material during impregnation generates a decrease in the surface area and defect states in the optical properties. Maximum hydrogen production rate 1486.4 µmol g−1 h−1 is observed on 1Co-1Cu-ST photocatalyst. This improvement in photocatalytic reaction is related to the role played by each co-catalyst. CONCLUSIONS: The photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution shows the role of co-catalyst in the redox reactions process. In the case of CuO co-catalyst, it helps charge transfer, specifically electrons, to be carried out more efficiently by reducing water to produce H2. On the other hand, the role of CoO co-catalyst is to catalyze the oxidation process, improving charge carriers separation and providing electrons to the SnO2@TiO2. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.;charge carrier separation | co-catalyst | heterojunction | hydrogen generation | photocatalysis | redox reactions;45;0;;;;undefined;

We identified a novel variant, rs56848936 in the gene SYMPK at 19q13.3, associated with colon cancer risk (odds ratio 0.61 for the risk allele G, p = 2.4 × 10−8). The frequency of the G allele was 0.06 in African Americans, compared to <0.01 in Europeans, Asians and Amerindians in the 1000 Genomes project. In addition, a variant previously identified through fine-mapping in this GWAS in the region 19q13.1, rs7252505, was confirmed to be more strongly associated with CRC in the African American replication set than the variant originally reported in Europeans (rs10411210).

Method The genomic DNA of 23 drug-resistant epilepsy patients and 7 patients with good responses were analyzed. Ten exons in these four genes were genotyped, and the drug concentrations in saliva and plasma were determined. Results The relevant SNPs with pharmacogenomics relations were CYP2D6*2 (rs16947) decreased your activity and CYP2D6*4 (rs1065852), CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285) and CYP3A4*1B (rs2740574) by association with poor metabolizer. The strongest risk factors were found in the AA genotype and allele of SNP rs3892097 from the CYP2D6 gene, followed by the alleles A and T of SNPs rs2740574 and rs2687116, respectively from CYP3A4. The most important concomitance was between homozygous genotype AA of rs3892097 and genotype AA of rs2740574 with 78.3% in drug-resistant epilepsy patients as compared to 14.3% in control patients.

It was also aimed to evaluate if species composition and abundance varies across several spatial scales. The number of sampled echinoderm species from 36 P. damicornis coral heads was 24, which fell inside the 95 % confidence interval of the Chao1 species richness estimator, while as many as 42 species were expected to occur. The analysis indicated that the echinoderm diversity was not particularly large among the samples (4–6 species) or across localities (5–12 species). Nevertheless, the observed associated echinoderm richness resulted from a small, although significant, species replacement among the coral heads and reef localities across the southern Mexican Pacific. The relative large number of echinoderms associated with P. damicornis may serve as a proxy for predicting potential biodiversity loss caused by the coral reef degradation currently observed in the study area.;Coral heads | Cryptofauna | Eastern Pacific | Patch reefs;8;0;;;CONACYT;236654;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In this research, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity, wound healing efficacy and chemical characterization of J. neopauciflora latex in a murine model. Materials and methods The antibacterial activity was determined using Gram positive and negative strains, the antifungal activity was determined using yeast and filamentous fungi, and the wound healing efficacy of the latex was determined using the tensiometric method. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using the plantar oedema model in rats, administering the latex orally and topically. Cytotoxic activity was determined in vitro in two different cell lines. Antioxidant capacity, total phenolics, total flavonoids, reducing carbohydrates and latex proteins were quantified. The latex analysis was performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Finally, molecular exclusion chromatography was performed. Results The latex demonstrated antibacterial activity. The most sensitive strains were Gram positive bacteria, particularly S. aureus (MIC=2 mg/mL), and the latex had bacteriostatic activity. The latex did not show antifungal activity. The latex demonstrated a wound-healing efficacy, even the positive control (Recoveron). The orally administered latex demonstrated the best anti-inflammatory activity and was not toxic to either of the 2 cell lines. The latex had a high antioxidant capacity (SA50=5.4 µg/mL), directly related to the total phenolic (6.9 mg GAE/mL) and flavonoid (12.53 µg QE/mL) concentration. The carbohydrate concentration was 18.52 µg/mL, and fructose was the most abundantly expressed carbohydrate in the latex (14.63 µg/mL, 79.03%). Additionally, the latex contained proteins (7.62 µg/mL) in its chemical constitution. As secondary metabolites, the HPLC analysis indicated the presence of phenols and flavonoids.

Action potentials were produced by a Hodgkin-Huxley type model including different types ofK+, Na+ and Ca2+ ionic channels while the buffered diffusion of Ca2+ was simulated using the finite element method. In this model, Ca2+-dependent mechanisms (i.e. ionic channels and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms) are directly regulated by the concentration of Ca2+ at the submembrane space estimated from the diffusion model. According to our simulations, the Ca2+ transients produced by the electrical activity pattern are capable of reaching depths as high as 3 μmfrom the Ca2+ channels despite the buffering properties of the cytosol. In addition, we show that the activity of both Ca2+ buffers and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms allows the continuous firing of action potentials by preventing the accumulation of Ca2+ in the vicinity of the cell membrane. Finally, our simulations suggest that submembrane Ca2+ domains are produced by the overlapping of Ca2+ signals from neighbor clusters of Ca2+ channels. In general, we present a model of the human pancreatic β-cell based on a new modeling framework that, in addition to simulate the electrical activity of the cell, is capable of considering the geometrical and spatial aspects of the cell in order to determine the temporal course of the Ca2+ signal in the intracellular space.;Action potential | Calcium | Diffusion | Electrical activity | Human | β-cell;5;0;;;;undefined;

Questions: Is flowering continuous or episodic? What are the breeding and mating systems and what floral visitors are associated? and Does the reproductive success change over time? Study species: Astrophytum ornatum (Cactaceae). Study site and years of study: Observations from 2010 to 2011, in the highest density population of A. ornatum in Metztitlán Canyon (Hgo. México). Methods: Monthly surveys and monitoring of reproductive structures. Tracking flowers in anthesis. Controlled pollinations to determine the mating system and determination of the Outcrossing Index (OCI), the pollen /ovule ratio and breeding system. Results: Astrophytum ornatum produced flower buds throughout the year, but 89.2% of them were aborted. Four events of ephemeral flowering population were presented per year. The species is self-incompatible and controlled pollinations indicated pollinator limitation of several bee species. The OCI indicates that the species is facultative xenogamous, and pollen/ovule ratio indicates obligate xenogamy. On average there were 54 seeds/fruit and individuals produced 4 fruits/year. Conclusions: The continuous production of buds had rarely been reported for cacti. Intrapopulation bloom is one of the shortest recorded for the family and it produces high floral synchrony. The low number of seeds / fruit and flowers / individual, coupled with the narrow niche breadth of species and various anthropogenic factors place Astrophytum ornatum as a susceptible species to be extinct.;Breeding system | Continuous production of flower buds | Mating system | Phenology | Reproductive success;9;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

That is the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and metabolic syndrome (MetS), whose expression can be influenced by different risk factors. Recent Advances: In recent decades, it has been widely described that MetS increases the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. MetS pathogenesis involves several vascular risk factors such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance (I/R). Critical Issues: Reported evidence shows that vascular risk factors are associated with AD, particularly in the development of protein aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction, and disturbances in signaling pathways, with insulin receptor signaling being a common alteration between MetS and AD. Future Directions: Insulin signaling has been involved in tau phosphorylation and amyloid β (Aβ) metabolism. However, it has also been demonstrated that Aβ oligomers can bind to insulin receptors, triggering their internalization, decreasing neuron responsiveness to insulin, and promoting insulin I/R. Thus, it could be argued that Aβ could be a convergent factor in the development of both pathologies.;;33;0;;;;undefined;

We now know that in addition to genetic defects, -cell organellar dysfunction participates in the earliest stages of the disease; other factors also contribute to this dysfunction, such as excessive production of reactive oxygen species and a decrease in cellular volume and mass.

Sampling of the Términos Lagoon (Mexico) was carried out in November 2009 in order to understand the influence of these particular environmental conditions on organic matter fluxes within the lagoon's pelagic ecosystem and, more specifically, on the relationship between phyto- and bacterioplankton communities. The measurements presented here concern biogeochemical parameters (nutrients, dissolved and particulate organic matter [POM], and dissolved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]), phytoplankton (biomass and photosynthesis), and bacteria (diversity and abundance, including PAH degradation bacteria and ectoenzymatic activities). During the studied period, the water column of the Términos Lagoon functioned globally as a sink and, more precisely, as a qnitrogen assimilator/q. This was due to the high production of particulate and dissolved organic matter (DOM), even though exportation of autochthonous matter to the Gulf of Mexico was weak. We found that qbottom-up/q control accounted for a large portion of the variability of phytoplankton productivity. Nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry mostly accounted for the heterogeneity in phytoplankton and free-living prokaryote distribution in the lagoon. In the eastern part, we found a clear decoupling between areas enriched in dissolved inorganic nitrogen near the Puerto Real coastal inlet and areas enriched in phosphate (PO4) near the Candelaria estuary. Such a decoupling limited the potential for primary production, resulting in an accumulation of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON, respectively) near the river mouths. In the western part of the lagoon, maximal phytoplankton development resulted from bacterial activity transforming particulate organic phosphorus (PP) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) to available PO4 and the coupling between Palizada River inputs of nitrate (NO3) and PP. The Chumpan River contributed only marginally to PO4 inputs due to its very low contribution to overall river inputs. The highest dissolved total PAH concentrations were measured in the El Carmen Inlet, suggesting that the anthropogenic pollution of the zone is probably related to the oil-platform exploitation activities in the shallow waters of the southern of the Gulf of Mexico. We also found that a complex array of biogeochemical and phytoplanktonic parameters were the driving force behind the geographical distribution of bacterial community structure and activities. Finally, we showed that nutrients brought by the Palizada River supported an abundant bacterial community of PAH degraders, which are of significance in this important oil-production zone.;;8;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

We used transects to determine the bird species' abundances and the height and cover of vegetation to obtain three main variables: foliage height diversity, life form diversity, and total foliage density. Cluster analyses using the bird species' relative abundances grouped similar vegetation types, regardless of the geographic distance between them, during the breeding season but not in the non-reproductive season. This result suggests that birds occupy the various habitats in a random way during the non-reproductive season. Most of the bird species were closely related to the vegetation volume and foliage height diversity in both seasons, while the diversity of plant growth forms was of little importance.;Bird distribution | Chihuahuan Desert | Community ecology | Foliage height diversity | Life form diversity | Total vegetation volume;1;0;;;;undefined;

Although the estimated heritability is high, common variants identified by genome-wide association studies explain only a small proportion of this heritability. A combination of linkage and association strategies could be a more robust and powerful approach to identify other obesity-susceptibility variants. We thus sought to identify novel genetic variants associated with obesity-related traits in the Mexican population by combining these methods. We performed a genome-wide linkage scan for body mass index (BMI) and other obesity-related phenotypes in 16 Mexican families using the Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines Program. Associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for associations in an independent cohort. Two suggestive BMI-linkage peaks (logarithm of odds ≥1.5) were observed at chromosomal regions 11q13 and 13q22. Only rs614080 in the 11q13 region was significantly associated with BMI and related traits in these families. This association was also significant in an independent cohort of Mexican adults. Moreover, this variant was significantly associated with GSTP1 gene expression levels in adipose tissue. In conclusion, the rs614080 SNP near the GSTP1 gene was significantly associated with BMI and GSTP1 expression levels in the Mexican population.;;2;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We hypothesized that magnetic facial nerve stimulation would worsen epileptiform activity in two animal models of active seizures. The rat intraperitoneal kainate model and pig intracortical penicillin model were employed. Magnetic facial nerve stimulation was delivered unilaterally at a variety of stimulation parameters, and the effect on ictal epileptiform activity measured by electroencephalography was determined according to an established categorical scale. Principal results In 6 rats and 3 pigs evaluated with 83 stimulation trials, only a single stimulation trial was associated with worsening epileptiform activity according to a standard categorization scheme. Surprisingly, a reduction in the severity of the epileptiform activity was observed in 20 of 50 stimulation trials using patterned stimulation (3 pulses at 30 Hz repeated at 0.5–10 Hz) versus 2 of 33 stimulation trials using simple monotonic patterns (P < 0.005, chi-squared test). The reduction of epileptiform activity after stimulation lasted a few minutes and was reproducible. Major Conclusions Epileptiform activity measured by electroencephalography was not reliably worsened by repetitive facial nerve stimulation with pulsed magnetic energy, even when significant brain exposure to the magnetic field occurred as in the rat model. To the contrary, a temporary reduction in epileptiform activity was often, but not invariably, observed with certain stimulation parameters.;Cerebral blood flow | Facial nerve | Magnetic stimulation | Seizure;0;0;;;;undefined;

A total of 141 schoolchildren participated in this cross-sectional study. Children were selected from two communities: one with a low (0.4 ppm) and the other with a high (1.8 ppm) water fluoride concentration. Dental fluorosis was evaluated by applying the Thylstrup and Fejerskov Index (TFI) criteria. Stimulated saliva was obtained, and fluoride concentration and GST activity were measured. The GST activity was compared among children with different levels of dental fluorosis using multinomial logistic regression models and odds ratios (OR). The mean age of the children was 10.6 (±1.03) years. Approximately half of the children showed dental fluorosis (52.5 %). The average GST activity was 0.5678 (±0.1959) nmol/min/μg. A higher concentration of fluoride in the saliva was detected in children with a higher GST activity (p = 0.039). A multinomial logistic regression model used to evaluate the GST activity and the dental fluorosis score identified a strong association between TFI = 2–3 (OR = 15.44, p = 0.007) and TFI ≥ 4 (OR = 55.40, p = 0.026) and the GST activity level, compared with children showing TFI = 0–1, adjusted for age and sex. Schoolchildren with higher levels of dental fluorosis and a higher fluoride concentration in the saliva showed greater GST activity. The increased GST activity most likely was the result of the body’s need to inactivate free radicals produced by exposure to fluoride.;Dental fluorosis | Fluorides | Glutathione S-transferase | Oxidative stress | Saliva;3;0;;;;undefined;

A total of 61 localities on a variety of substrata were sampled between 2008 and 2014 using different methodology techniques. Twenty-four species were collected and members of the families Ophiocomidae, Ophiotrichidae and Ophiactidae were the most widespread. The new records of 28 species have relevance in terms of filling distribution gaps along the Mexican Pacific or extending their geographical distribution ranges. This considerable number can be attributed to a higher number of prospected localities and the diversification of collecting methods. An updated checklist from the study area is provided, including previous literature records and those found during this work, summarising 57 species. Islas Marías was the area with the highest number of species and with the highest value of taxonomic distinctness, which can be explained since these islands are considered as stepping stones for the dispersal of species in the Mexican Pacific. Despite the important diversity and composition of ophiuroids in our study area, a sample-based rarefaction curve suggests that at least 104 species can inhabit the area, so we recommend conducting more research in the region.;Brittle stars | Checklist | New distribution records | Substrata | Taxonomic distinctness;7;0;;;CONACYT;336853;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We analysed the relevance of geography (latitude, longitude), oceanographic factors (temperature, chlorophyll a concentration) and bottom type (coral, rock, sand, fleshy algae, coralline algae and turf) on the abundances of Astrocaneum spinosum and Astrodictyum panamense in Los Angeles Bay, Mexico (29°N, 113°W), in 2006–2007. Depth did not influence the number of individuals per census, but an elevated chlorophyll a concentration resulted in a higher abundance during the autumn (possibly the reproductive season of Astrodictyum panamense and Astrocaneum spinosum). The abundances of both species were positively linked to the presence of rocky bottoms and decreased in sandy areas. Additionally, the presence of live coral favoured the occurrence of Astrodictyum panamense, while high macroalgal cover decreased its abundance. The spatial distributions of both ophiuroids were aggregated at most sites, and they were always associated with different species of octocorals, which are abundant in the area. Astrocaneum spinosum is considered among the 30 most important invertebrates in the aquarium trade in Mexico; therefore, its permanence in the study area could be affected by excessive extractions.";bottom type | Echinoderms | environmental factors | Los Angeles Bay Biosphere Reserve | reef communities;2;0;;;;undefined;

A common consequence of becoming nonphotosynthetic is the reduction in size and gene content of the plastid genome. In exceptional circumstances, it can even result in the complete loss of the plastid DNA (ptDNA) and its associated gene expression system, as reported recently in several lineages, including the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus Polytomella. Closely related to Polytomella is the polyphyletic genus Polytoma, the members of which lost photosynthesis independently of Polytomella. Species from both genera are free-living organisms that contain nonphotosynthetic plastids, but unlike Polytomella, Polytoma members have retained a genome in their colorless plastid. Here, we present the plastid genome of Polytoma uvella: to our knowledge, the first report of ptDNA from a nonphotosynthetic chlamydomonadalean alga. The P. uvella ptDNA contains 25 protein-coding genes, most of which are related to gene expression and none are connected to photosynthesis. However, despite its reduced coding capacity, the P. uvella ptDNA is inflated with short repeats and is tens of kilobases larger than the ptDNAs of its closest known photosynthetic relatives, Chlamydomonas leiostraca and Chlamydomonas applanata. In fact, at approximately 230 kb, the ptDNA of P. uvella represents the largest plastid genome currently reported from a nonphotosynthetic alga or plant. Overall, the P. uvella and Polytomella plastid genomes reveal two very different evolutionary paths following the loss of photosynthesis: expansion and complete deletion, respectively. We hypothesize that recombination-based DNA-repair mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the different evolutionary outcomes observed in such closely related nonphotosynthetic algae.;;24;1;repositoryvor;Green;NSERC;402421–2011;Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

In this study, we investigated the effects of systemically applied oxytocin on the cardiorespiratory activity in a rodent model of moderate endotoxemia. Methods Telemetrically recorded electrocardiogram (ECGs) from animals which received lipopolysaccharide (LPS); oxytocin (Ox); lipopolysaccharide + oxytocin (LPS + Ox), or vehicle (V) were analyzed using the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) technique to estimate the respiratory rate. The mean R–R interval and the spectral parameters of heart rate variability (HRV), such as the natural logarithm of the high frequency (lnHF) and low frequency (lnLF) components were also estimated up to 24 h after treatment. Results The endotoxemic animals (LPS) showed an elevated respiratory rate as well as a reduced mean R–R interval, lnHF and lnLF components compared to controls (V) from +5 to +12 h after the treatment. The administration of oxytocin significantly attenuated the hyperventilation produced by the LPS-induced endotoxemia (LPS + Ox) and restored the values of the mean R–R interval and such spectral parameters at different time points. Conclusions Our results support the existence of a link among the respiratory, cardiovascular, and immune systems in which oxytocin seems to act as a potential cardioprotective peptide by favoring cardiac cholinergic autonomic coupling. As a result, oxytocin diminished animal's endotoxemic tachypnea and restored the cardiorespiratory interactions, which was indicated by the spectral components of HRV.";Anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway | ECG-derived respiration | HRV | LPS | Oxytocin;13;0;;;CONACYT;267761;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

One of the most severe problems in coastal systems is eutrophication. It is a process of anthropic origin that mainly increases the concentrations of nitrogen, organic matter, and/or phosphorus in bodies of water.

To evaluate the trophic state of the Pom-Atasta (PA) and Palizada del Este fluvial-lagoon systems through the TRIX index. Methods. During different months from 2005 to 2014, water samples were collected at ten sampling sites for each fluvial-lagoon system to evaluate a number of physical variables (dissolved oxygen), chemicals (nitrogenous components and reactive phosphorus), and chlorophyll a, both on the surface andeat middle depths. The TRIX index was used to analyze the trophic state of the systems. Results. The PA and PE systems were characterized as oligotrophic systems with mesotrophic tendency. Conclusions. We recommend that the water quality and the magnitude of cholorophyll a at the Pom-Atasta and Palilzadadel Este systems continue to be monitoredain order to establish seasonal or annual trends of the trophic state of these systems.;Fluvial-lagoon systems | Gulf of Mexico | Trophic index | Water quality;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Recent morphological and phylogenetic studies of Laurencia in the Atlantic Ocean have modified our current knowledge of the group. Approximately 23% of the worldwide generic diversity has been recorded in this region. Goals. Update the checklist of the Laurencia species in the Atlantic and describe the distribution patterns within the genus. Methods. We obtained records of Laurencia species in the Atlantic from a review of the literature and distributional data were used to define areas of endemism through a PAE (Parsimony of Areas of Endemism) analysis. Results. We propose an updated checklist of the 30 currently recognized species of Laurencia in the Atlantic Ocean; this checklist also includes taxonomic synonyms, nomenclatural remarks, and a detailed distribution for each species. The distributional range for the genus in the Atlantic extends from Bermuda and Northern Europe in the North Atlantic to Brazil and South Africa in the South Atlantic. We were able to define four areas of endemism: Brazil with four endemic species, the Gulf of Guinea with four endemic species, the northeastern Atlantic with three endemic species, and South Africa with four endemic species; also documented was one secondary area (Macaronesian Islands) with the endemic species L. viridis. Moreover, 17 of the 30 species of the Atlantic are also distributed in the Indo-Pacific, of which five are amphi-Atlantic species. Conclusions. The patterns found are related to geological events that occurred in the past, a fact that allows us to formulate a vicariance hypothesis about these species biogeographic history. Therefore, future work that will document new species and the clarification of taxonomic problems will allow researchers to continue enriching this hypothesis.";Area of endemism | Biogeography | PAE analysis | Red algae;0;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Meristotheca cylindrica is a red alga distributed in the Campeche coast, usually misidentified by the morphological variation spectrum exhibited in its populations. Objectives. We proposed to evaluate the genetic variation and its relationship with morphological variation in M. cylindrica populations, to describe the possible genetic structure and its haplotypic distribution and to determine possible speciation events. Methods. We measured genetic variation, distances and structure of 45 individuals of M. cylindrica from five populations of Campeche, using DNA sequences of the spacer regions of RuBisCo and cox2-3. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses were performed considering sequences of Solieriaceae species available in the GenBank. A statistical analysis covering 30 morphological characters was performed on 10 herbarium specimens. Results. The RuBisCo spacer region revealed four interconnected haplotypes (R1-R4), as well as moderated genetic diversity parameters (Hd= 0.46458, π= 0.00785). Phylogenetic analysis showed a single monophyletic group that included all haplotypes. The cox2-3 spacer region revealed nine haplotypes (C1-C9) structured in the GI and GII groups, as well as elevated parameters of genetic diversity, distances and differentiation (Hd = 0.81, π = 0.06476; >10% of differences; PdblPT and FST> 0.35). Phylogenetic analysis showed two monophyletic groups congruent with GI and GII. Analysis of variance showed morphological homogeneity among populations. Conclusions.

Serotonin neurons at the CNS level are confined to the brainstem and are located in the raphe nuclei. Serotonin 5-HT is synthesized from the amino acid L-tryptophan (from the diet) by sequential hydroxylation and decarboxylation. It is stored in presynaptic vesicles and released from nerve terminals during neuronal firing. 5-HT is involved in numerous physiological and behavioral disorders, such as major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, mania, autism, and obesity, and it recently has been proposed as an essential component in the modulation of pain. However, this neurotransmitter is related with a number of physiological processes, such as cardiovascular function, gastric motility, kidney function, etc. Based on pharmacological, structural, and transductional characteristics, the 5-HT receptor family is divided into seven subfamilies (5-HT1-5-HT7), comprising 15 receptor subtypes, each of these corresponding to distinct genes. Descending 5-HT pathways exert an inhibitory (descending inhibition) or facilitatory (descending facilitation) influence on the spinal processing of nociceptive information, depending on acute or chronic pain states and the type of receptor acted upon. The exact nature of the receptors involved in 5-HT modulation of pain in the CNS remains to be elucidated. However, studies have revealed the presence of at least three families of 5-HT receptors in the spinal cord (5-HT1, 5-HT2, and 5-HT3), with varying affinity for 5-HT, and recently, the 5-HT7 receptor, which is also excitatory, has been postulated as being linked with, among other things, circadian rhythms, thermoregulation, and migraine. Several lines of evidence have implicated a role for this serotonin in the human health implications of pain; however, it is important to bear in mind the understanding of how pain is modulated by serotonergic receptors in the CNS in terms of the following: the distribution of the different serotonergic receptors in the raphe-spinal pathway; the dose of agonists or antagonists to the 5-HT receptors, the administration route of agonists or antagonists to the 5-HT receptors, and the type and duration of pain.";Neurotransmitter | Pain | Serotonin;0;0;;;;undefined;

It has been demonstrated and is widely accepted that CBZ is effective in the control of epileptic crises; unfortunately, there is scattered information concerning whether CBZ can aid in the sleep disorders produced by these crises. Because CBZ is one of the drugs that is most employed as an antiepileptic, it is important to analyze its effect on the electrical activity of the brain and sleep patterns under experimental and clinical conditions. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the administration of CBZ on the sleep patterns in a model of epilepsy induced by KA and its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlation. In this study, 40 male Wistar rats (weighing 250-280 g) were employed. Group 1 KA animals (n = 10) were chronically implanted with bipolar electrodes in the motor cortex, this to register cerebral activity (ElectroEncephaloGram [EEG]) and that of the neck muscles to obtain the muscular activity (ElectroMyoGram [EMG]). An electroencephalographic registry was taken from day 1 (Control); on day 2, Kainic Acid (KA) (10 mg/kg) was administered to induce the epileptic crisis and the registry continued for 5 additional days. Group 2 (CBZ+KA) animals (n = 10) followed the same chronic implantation of bipolar electrodes: day 1 (Control) was registered, and on Day 2, CBZ (25 mg/kg) was administered 30 min prior to the injection of KA, with the registry continuing for 3 additional days. Histological samples were obtained to evaluate the damage elicited by the drugs employed (n = 10). Group 3 animals (n = 10) were implanted with a cannula in the jugular vein to obtain the blood samples; a baseline sample was taken prior to the administration of CBZ (25 mg/kg), Subsequently, blood samples were taken at 10, 20, and 40 min and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h for the pharmacokinetic analysis. To assess the differences between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, a Student t test for unpaired samples was performed, and p < 0.05 was considered to denote a significant difference. To evaluate the differences between the groups of EEG, the data was analyzed by a one-way ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) (*p < 0.01 and **p < 0.001). The results showed a total absence of sleep during the first experimental day (Day 1) in Group 1 (KA), while in Group 2 (CBZ+KA), a partial recovery of Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) was also exhibited also during Day 1. Histological analysis revealed similar damage to that present in temporal-lobe epilepsy. The effect of CBZ was favorable, given that the crises significantly decreased when administered with CBZ, the latter demonstrated by comparison of the pharmacokinetics with the crisis. Conclusion. CBZ significantly decreases crises; however, only partial recovery of sleep is present and the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is the most damaged. A correlation was present between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of CBZ and its effect exerted on the sleep-wake cycle.";;0;0;;;;undefined;

The function of tentacles is to collect food particles. From our results, we suggest these organs could also be part of the digestive system. Therefore proteases in the digestive tract and tentacles of Isostichopus fuscus were partially characterized by histological and biochemical methods. Digestive cells and regions, and secretory granules were observed by histological methods in both organs. Proteolytic extracts of the digestive tract and tentacles showed peak activity at pH 6 and 8. The digestive tract extract had peak activity at 40 and 70 °C, whereas the tentacle extract peak activity was at 60 °C. Both extracts showed activity at 0 to 10 °C. The extracts retained 67 to 75 % residual activity when incubated at 60 °C for 1 h. The effect of different ions and specific inhibitors suggested the presence of cysteine-and metallo-proteases in both organs. SDS-PAGE showed 6 proteins of approximately 40, 43, 49, 76, 106, and 147 kDa in the digestive tract extract, and 5 proteins of approximately 44, 60, 81, 108, and 150 kDa in the tentacle extract. Native-PAGE and zymography assays confirmed the presence approximately 100 kDa proteases in both extracts.

Mangroves have several mechanisms of resistance to salinity and most species exhibit some xeromorphic features in order to conserve water. Leaf area and stomatal density play an important role in maintaining water balance, and gas exchange is regulated by their aperture and density, two traits that vary intraspecifically in response to environmental conditions, such as water stress and salinity. In this study, we evaluated the effects of salinity on stomatal density, leaf area and plant size in R. mangle and we tested for associations among the three variables, across three sites along a natural salinity gradient in the XelHá Park, Quintana Roo, Mexico. We hypothesized that high salinity sites would produce smaller plants, with smaller leaves, and fewer stomata. Three sampling sites with different environmental conditions were chosen and salinities were monitored monthly. A total of 542 plants were tagged and tree heights and diameters were measured for each individual within each of the three sampling sites. Three leaves from 20 trees from each site were measured to determine leaf area. Stomatal densities were determined in each leaf using nail polish casts, examining ten 1 mm squares per leaf under an optical microscope. A principal component analysis was used to assess association between tree height, leaf area, and stomatal density for each plot. The salinity gradient was reflected in plant size, producing smaller plants at the higher salinity site. The largest leaves were found at the low salinity site (51.2 ± 24.99 cm2). Leaf length was not correlated to plant size (LL vs. tree height: r= 0.02, P= 0.8205; LL vs. trunk diameter: r= 0.03, P= 0.7336), so we concluded that leaf length is an environmentally plastic trait of red mangroves that may vary as a function of environmental conditions, such as hydric stress caused by elevated salinity. The larger leaves from the low salinity site had lower densities of stomata (65.0 stomata.mm2 SD= 12.3), and increasing salinities did not decrease stomatal density (intermediate salinity site: 73.4 stomata.mm2 SD= 13.5; high salinity site: 74.8 stomata.mm2 SD= 17.3). Our results confirm that stomatal density is inversely related to leaf area (r= -0.29, P < 0.001), especially leaf width (r= -0.31, P < 0.001), and that salinity may increase stomatal density by causing reduction of leaf size.";Leaf area | Leaf plasticity | Mangroves | Stomatal densities | Tree height | Water stress;19;1;repositoryam;Green;NMSU;243375/ 374628;New Mexico State University

Because estuarine fish communities undergo temporal changes in abundance and species composition, the influence of environmental factors on diel and seasonal variation in the structure of a fish community was evaluated. This information is necessary to extend our knowledge of fish communities in tropical estuaries. The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that the total number of fish, species richness and fish composition would undergo temporal variations related to the variability of environmental conditions. Materials and methods. In Pueblo Viejo Lagoon (western Gulf of Mexico), six 24-h sampling cycles every 2 months were carried out. Fish were collected every 2 h during each 24-h cycle using a beach seine net. Data were analysed using repeated measures PERMANOVA and canonical correspondence analysis. Results. Diel variation in total fish number and species richness tended to peak at dawn and dusk, with significant differences between the periods of day, night and twilight. Total number of fish had significant pulses during the dry season and rainy season, whereas species richness showed a pulse in March–July. Fish community structure was mainly influenced by salinity, temperature, rainfall, and seagrass cover. Seasonally, three fish groups were observed. The fish assemblage during the rainy season was mainly characterized by low-salinity tolerant species. The fish assemblage during the cold-dry period was dominated by species with low-temperature affinities whereas filter-feeding species tended to be dominant during the warm-dry period. Differences in fish assemblages among diel periods were mainly due to some species were typically diurnal, nocturnal or crepuscular. Conclusion. This study allowed determining that total fish abundance and richness are related at diel level with the transition period between the activities of diurnal and nocturnal species, and with fish strategies of predator avoidance and foraging. At seasonal level, these seem to be coupled to periods of high productivity in the system. Moreover, the fish composition showed a seasonal succession of species, which may be determined by a combination of temporal changes in salinity, rainfall, temperature, and by the different feeding strategies of species.;Constrained ordination | PERMANOVA | Ruppia maritima | Seasonal succession | Twilight pulses;4;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;UAM;undefined;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

Yet, the effects of drinking by Mexican-origin individuals may differ between cities on versus off the border both in the United States and in Mexico. We characterize prior 12-month drinking patterns and examine their relationships with AUD, in border and off-border cities of Texas and adjacent Mexican states. Methods: Data come from the U.S.–Mexico Study of Alcohol and Related Conditions involving 2,336 Mexican Americans in Texas and 2,460 Mexicans in bordering states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas in Mexico. Drinking pattern was defined as an interaction between volume and maximum amount, or intensity (never vs. ever 5+/4+ [men/women], 8+, and 12+ drinks in a day). DSM-5 AUD was assessed using an adaptation of the Alcohol Section of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview core. Separately by gender, 5 logistic regressions models controlling for age were estimated predicting symptoms in 2 or more AUD criteria domains from volume, heavy pattern and, successively, effects of country, and (by country) residing on vs. off the border, or in each of 3 cities/country. Results: A segmentation analysis for Texas males based on rate of experiencing AUD generated several distinct volume groups, each partitioned by an empirically selected maximum, and helped identify a drinking-pattern typology. In gender-stratified models of AUD rates using this typology, adjusting for age, significant volume and intensity effects were seen, more strongly in the United States. Border versus interior differences implied more AUD for given patterns at the border in the United States and the reverse in Mexico, with some city differences also evident. Conclusions: Drinking-pattern analyses confirm that border proximity may affect drinking problems but in opposite directions in the United States and Mexico, possibly related to economic and psychological stresses specific to respective communities.;Alcohol Dependence | Alcohol Drinking | Mexican Origin | Population Survey | U.S.–Mexico Border;7;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;P50AA005595;National Institutes of Health

Particulate matter (PM), which has metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) adsorbed, among others has been linked to adverse health outcomes and may modify DNA methylation. To evaluate PM exposure impact on repetitive elements and gene-specific DNA methylation and DNA damage, we conducted a cross-sectional study in 150 schoolchildren (7–10 years old) from an urbanized, industrial area of the metropolitan area of Mexico City (MAMC), which frequently exhibits PM concentrations above safety standards. Methylation (5 mC) of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE1) and DNA repair gene (OGG1, APEX, and PARP1) was assessed by pyrosequencing in peripheral mononuclear cells, DNA damage by comet assay and DNA oxidation by 8-OHdG content. PAH and metal contents in PM10 (≤10 μm aerodynamic diameter) were determined by HPLC–MS and ICP-AES, respectively. Multiple regression analysis between DNA methylation, DNA damage, and PM10 exposure showed that PM10 was significantly associated with oxidative DNA damage; a 1% increase in 5 mC at all CpG sites in PARP1 promoter was associated with a 35% increase in 8-OHdG, while a 1% increase at 1, 2, and 3 CpG sites resulted in 38, 9, and 56% increments, respectively. An increase of 10 pg/m3 in benzo[b]fluoranthene content of PM10 was associated with a 6% increase in LINE1 methylation. Acenaphthene, indene [1,2,3-cd] pyrene, and pyrene concentrations correlated with higher dinucleotide methylation in OGG1, APEX and PARP1 genes, respectively. Vanadium concentration correlated with increased methylation at selected APEX and PARP1 CpG sites. DNA repair gene methylation was significantly correlated with DNA damage and with specific PM10-associated PAHs and Vanadium. Data suggest that exposure to PM and its components are associated with differences in DNA methylation of repair genes in children, which may contribute to DNA damage.";Children's health | DNA methylation | DNA repair | Genetic damage | PM exposure;38;0;;;NIEHS;155179;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences

Mitigating the impacts of GEC on cacti will require a coordinated effort that combines conservation, research, and education. Botanical gardens are uniquely positioned to lead such an effort because their living collections and programs focus on conservation and research. A coordinated network of botanical gardens - with living collections serving as experimental gardens-could become a crucial hub for studying the impacts of climate change on cacti.

Indeed, hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei (PVN) electrical stimuli reduce the nociceptive neuronal activity (i.e., neuronal discharge associated with activation of Aδ- and C-fibers) of the spinal dorsal horn wide dynamic range (WDR) cells and nociceptive behavior. Furthermore, raphe magnus nuclei lesion reduces the PVN-induced antinociception, suggesting a functional interaction between the OXT and the serotoninergic system. The present study investigated in Wistar rats the potential role of spinal serotonergic mechanisms in the OXT- and PVN-induced antinociception. In long-term secondary mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by formalin or extracellular unitary recordings of the WDR cells we evaluated the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) effect on the OXT-induced antinociception. All drugs were given intrathecally (i.t.). OXT (1 × 10− 5–1 × 10− 4 nmol) or 5-HT (1 × 10− 3–1 × 10− 1 nmol) prevented the formalin-induced sensitization, an effect mimicked by PVN stimulation. Moreover, administration of OXT (1 × 10− 5 nmol) plus 5-HT (1 × 10− 3 nmol) at ineffective doses, produced antinociception. This effect was antagonized by: (i) d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Tyr-NH29]OVT (oxytocin receptor antagonist; 2 × 10− 2 nmol); or (ii) methiothepin (a non-specific 5-HT1/2/5/6/7 receptor antagonist; 80 nmol). Similar results were obtained with PVN stimulation plus 5-HT (5 × 10− 5 nmol). In WDR cell recordings, the PVN-induced antinociception was enhanced by i.t. 5-HT and partly blocked when the spinal cord was pre-treated with methiothepin (80 nmol). Taken together, these results suggest that serotonergic mechanisms at the spinal cord level are partly involved in the OXT-induced antinociception.";Allodynia | Analgesia | Methiothepin | Pain | Serotonin;5;0;;;CONACYT;164536;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

LEV is a second-generation anti-epileptic drug (AED) that is approved for clinical use as monotherapy and may also be used for adjunctive treatment of patients with seizures. Several researchers have recommended LEV as a treatment option in different diseases causing neuronal damage, and recently, LEV has been used as an antihyperalgesic drug. LEV exhibits favorable characteristics, including a low potential for interaction, a short elimination half-life, and has neither active metabolites nor major negative effects on cognition. This has generated many new research avenues for the utilization of this drug. However, the precise mechanism of action of LEV has not been fully elucidated. In this review, a search was conducted on PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCO, and the Science Citation index for studies evaluating the effects of LEV as an antiepileptic, neuroprotective, and hyperalgesic drug. A total of 32 studies related to the use of LEV suggested different mechanisms of action, such as binding to the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) protein, inhibition of Ca2+ N-type channels, and its presence as a neuromodulator. These studies concluded that the pharmacodynamics of LEV should be viewed as a single pathway, and should not be based on specific molecular targets that depend on the physiological or pathological conditions prevalent at that time.;Antiepileptic drug | epilepsy | hyperalgesic | levetiracetam | mechanism of action | neuronal damage;16;0;;;;undefined;

At present, neither the mechanisms of AuNP interaction with the plasma membrane surface and their delivery and intracellular distribution in cancer cells nor their effect on the plasma membrane so as to allow cell incorporation of larger amounts of AuNPs is known. The objective of this work was to study the interaction of bare 20 nm diameter AuNPs with the plasma membrane of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, as well as their uptake, intracellular distribution, and induction of changes on the cell surface roughness. The dynamics of intracellular incorporation and the distribution of AuNPs were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Changes in roughness were monitored in synchronized MCF-7 cells by atomic force microscopy high-resolution imaging at 6 hour intervals for 24 hours during a single cell cycle. The results show that bare AuNPs are capable of emitting fluorescence at 626 nm, without the need for a fluorescent biomarker, which allows monitoring their uptake and intracellular distribution until they reach the nucleus. These results are correlated with changes in cell roughness, which significantly increases at 12 hours of incubation with AuNPs, when compared with control cells. The obtained data provide bases to understand molecular processes of the use of AuNPs in the treatment of different diseases, mainly breast cancer.;Atomic force microscopy | Confocal laser scanning microscopy | Gold nanoparticles uptake | MCF-7 cells | Membrane roughness;14;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

A total of 16 gestating rabbit dams were divided into two groups, one of which was treated by administering PPT and subjected to a process ischemia. During this interval, fetal blood samples were drawn from each dam (in the ischemia group) at 0, 15 and 45 min. Ischemia for 15 and 45 min was not associated with changes in lactate levels of the Ischemia group foetuses. However, in the foetuses in the reperfusion groups without PPT lactate levels were significantly higher after 15 and 45 min of arterial occlusion compared to time zero. These results demonstrate that PTT alters some acute and some longer-term biochemical outcomes of uterine ischemia perhaps important in preserving energy metabolism under hypoxic conditions.;Cocarboxylase | Foetal welfare | Foetuses | Hypoxic-encephalopathy | Protective effect | Thiamine pyrophosphate;3;0;;;;undefined;

Amebiasis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, considered the third leading cause of death in the world. The rats are used as a natural resistance model to amoebic liver infection. The aim of this study is to analyze the interaction of Entamoeba histolytica with neutrophils, macrophages, and NK cells in livers of intact and vagotomized rats. Six groups were studied (n = 4): Intact (I), Intact + amoeba (IA), Sham (S), Sham + amoeba (SA), Vagotomized (V) and Vagotomized + amoeba (VA). Animals were sacrificed at 8 h post-inoculation of E. histolytica. Then, livers were obtained and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue liver slides were stained with H-E, PAS and Masson. The best development time for E. histolytica infection was at 8 h. Amoeba was identified with a monoclonal anti-220 kDa E. histolytica lectin. Neutrophils (N) were identified with rabbit anti-human neutrophil myeloperoxidase, macrophages (Mɸ) with anti-CD68 antibody and NK cells (NK) with anti-NK. Stomachs weight and liver glycogen were higher in V. Collagen increased in VA, whereas vascular and neutrophilic areas were decreased. There were fewer N, Mɸ, NK around the amoeba in the following order IA > SA > VA (p < 0.05 between IA and VA). In conclusion, these results suggest that the absence of parasympathetic innervation affects the participation of neutrophils, macrophages and NK cells in the innate immune response, apparently by parasympathetic inhibition on the cellular functions and probably for participation in sympathetic activity.;Entamoeba histolytica | Inflammation | Macrophages | Neutrophil | Vagotomy;5;0;;;CONACYT;PIBB11-3;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Also, there are few and oversimplified formulations that allow an understanding on the relation that exists between the elastic and inelastic energy demands for this type of soils. A study on energy reduction factors aimed at establishing inelastic input and hysteretic energy spectra for narrow-banded motions is presented. Unlike previous works, in this study elastic input energy spectra are used as input for energy functional forms that allow the formulation of inelastic energy spectra. For this purpose, over 250 seismic records recorded in soft soils are used. The energy reduction factors yield inelastic energy spectra that capture in a reasonable manner the energy content of narrow-banded ground motions, and yield a better characterization of inelastic energy demands.;Energy reduction factors | Hysteretic energy | Inelastic input energy | Seismic energy spectra;12;0;;;;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

In the past years craft beer sales have been growing faster than the dominant lager-style in countries with different beer tradition like Mexico and France. A change in consumption habits is a sign that the representation of the product is changing. It is, therefore, valuable to understand the elements and structure of this new representation. The present study was conducted to understand the impact of culture and consumption habits on beer representation. Three-hundred male consumers (craft and industrial beer users) were interviewed in Mexico and France. Participants were asked to perform: (1) free word association task using ""craft beer"" as inductor word, (2) ranking task of the evoked words based on their importance, and (3) valence rating task of each evoked word. Each word was characterized by a mean importance value and a frequency of elicitation to identify their role as central or peripheral elements in the representation. Results showed that consumers from same culture share similar social representations of craft beer, even when they have different consumption habits (craft-industrial). Mexican consumers share alcohol, and flavour as central elements in their representations but share only one peripheral element ""tradition"". French consumers share two central elements taste and party. When comparing consumers across cultures, French and Mexican craft participants share no central elements in their representations towards beer; whereas industrial beer consumers share one element ""alcohol"". Craft consumers seem to have a more structured social representation, sustained or nourished on consumption habits, whilst the representation of industrial beer consumers seems less resistant, or capable of changing over time.";Craft beer | Cross-cultural | Drinking experience | France | Mexico | Social representation;54;0;;;;undefined;

Escherichia coli adapts to microaerobicity by activating fermentation pathways that accumulate acidic by-products, in detriment of growth rate (μ) and biomass yield on glucose (YX/S). In this study, the metabolism of E. coli was modified to better cope with microaerobicity. For that purpose, genes coding for global regulators like carbon source responsive B protein and aerobic respiratory control A protein, or for fermentative pathways were inactivated. The performance of a wild-type (W3110) and engineered E. coli strains was evaluated in batch cultures at constant low dissolved oxygen tension (3% air sat.). By combining the partial elimination of fermentation pathways and the expression of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb), a 32% decrease on carbon waste as by-products, 24 % increase on YX/S and 13% increase of μ were obtained. Flux balance analysis of the best strain estimated major differences in the fluxes through the pentose phosphate pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle as consequence of VHb presence. Overall, our results show that E. coli can be genetically modified to overcome some of the disadvantages of microaerobic growth, which is potentially useful for better bioreactor scale-up and operation.;Aerobic respiratory control A protein | Carbon source responsive B protein | Fermentation pathways | Microaerobic processes | Vitreoscilla hemoglobin;9;0;;;CONACYT;183911;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

CGTase production, mainly by Bacillus sp., depends on fermentation conditions such as pH, temperature, concentration of nutrients, carbon and nitrogen sources, among others. Bacillus megaterium CGTase produces those three types of CDs, however, β-CD should prevail. Although, waxy corn starch (CS) is used industrially to obtain CGTase and CDs because of its high amylopectin content, alternative sources such as amaranth starch (AS) could be used to accomplish those purposes. AS has high susceptibility to the amylolytic activity of CGTase because of its 80% amylopectin content. Therefore, the aim of this work was evaluate the AS as carbon source for CGTase production by B. megaterium in a submerged fermentation. Afterwards, the CGTase was purified partially and its activity to synthesize α-, β-, and γ-CDs was evaluated using 1% AS as substrate. B. megaterium produced a 66 kDa CGTase (Topt = 50°C; pHopt = 8.0), from the early exponential growth phase which lasted 36 h. The maximum CGTase specific activity (106.62 ± 8.33 U/mg protein) was obtained after 36 h of culture. CGTase obtained with a Km = 0.152 mM and a Vmax = 13.4 μM/min yielded 40.47% total CDs using AS which was roughly twice as much as that of corn starch (CS; 24.48%). High costs to produce CDs in the pharmaceutical and food industries might be reduced by using AS because of its higher α-, β- and γ-CDs production (12.81, 17.94, and 9.92%, respectively) in a shorter time than that needed for CS.";Amaranth starch | Bacillus megaterium | CGTase | Cyclodextrin | Submerged fermentation;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Research has shown that the safety of some BCCs is similar to that found for boron-free compounds (judging from the acute toxicological evaluation). However, it has been observed that the administration of 3-thienylboronic acid (3TB) induced motor disruption in CD1 mice. In the current contribution we studied in deeper form the disruption of motor performance produced by the intraperitoneal administration of 3TB in mice from two strains (CD1 and C57BL6). Disruption of motor activity was dependent not only on the dose of 3TB administered, but also on the DMSO concentration in the vehicle. The ability of 3TB to enter the Central Nervous System (CNS) was evidenced by Raman spectroscopy as well as morphological effects on the CNS, such as loss of neurons yielding biased injury to the substantia nigra and striatum at doses ≥ 200 mg/kg, and involving granular cell damage at doses of 400 mg/kg but less injury in the motor cortex.

This study aims to describe the diversity of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 polymorphisms in Costa Rican populations in the context of their ancestry. A total of 448 healthy individuals were included in the study: Bribri (n= 47), Cabécar (n= 27), Maleku (n= 16), Guaymí (n= 30), Huetar (n= 48), Chorotega (n= 41), Admixed/Mestizos from the Central Valley/Guanacaste (n= 189), and Afro-Caribbeans (n= 50) from Limón. CYP2C9 (alleles *2, *3, *6) and CYP2C19 (*2, *3, *4, *5, *17) genotypes were determined by Real-Time PCR. African, European and Native American ancestry were inferred using 87 ancestry informative markers. The frequency of the decreased activity allele CYP2C9*2 is lower in the self-reported Amerindian groups compared to the admixed population, and the highest frequencies of CYP2C19*2 (null activity) and the CYP2C19*17 (increased activity) were found in the self-reported Afro- Caribbean population. Moreover, a frequency of 0.7 % CYP2C9 gPMs in the Admixed population and a variable frequency of CYP2C19 gUMs (0.0-32.6 %, more prevalent in Afro-Caribbeans) in Costa Rican populations, was found. Finally, the following alleles were positively correlated with genomic African ancestry and negatively correlated with genomic Native American ancestry: CYP2D6*5 (null activity), CYP2D6*17 (decreased activity), CYP2D6*29 (decreased activity) and CYP2C19*17 (increased activity).

Thus, in order to contribute on the knowledge of their trophic dynamics, we analyzed the inter-specific and ontogenetic (intra-specific) variation in the diet of these species. A total of 156 individuals of D. rhombeus were analyzed, which consumed 16 trophic groups, whereas 134 individuals of E. gula were analyzed and these consumed 13 trophic groups. The relative importance of trophic groups (gravimetric method) showed that the overall diet of both species was determined mainly by Detritus and Algae, with slight differences between species. The asymptotic pattern of the cumulative trophic diversity indicates that the diets are accurately represented for the study area. Ontogenetically (intra-specific level), the diet of smaller individuals of D. rhombeus (with Copepoda as main food source) showed significant differences with the diets of larger individuals; whereas the diets of larger individuals showed no difference among them. Also, there was a trend in which similarity in diet was lower when the separation in the size of fish was greater, indicating a trend in decreasing intra-specific competition. In contrast, for E. gula, there were no significant differences between the size groups analyzed. Therefore, for D. rhombeus the inter-specific competition for food resources may become stronger than intra-specific competition, while for E. gula, the intra-specific competition for food resources is stronger than interspecific competition.";Competition | Differential consumption | Resource partitioning | Trophic resources | Trophic similarity;4;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

However, results from the U.S.–Mexico Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions (UMSARC) revealed surprisingly large variation in alcohol outcomes even among Texas border sites, with alcohol use disorder (AUD) prevalence ~1.5 to 1.6 times greater in the border city of Laredo compared to both San Antonio and the border site of McAllen/Brownsville. Because a better understanding of this variation is important to identifying environmental influences on AUD, we developed and tested a conceptual model addressing variation in AUD prevalence across Texas UMSARC sites. Methods: Surveys involved in-person, household interviews with Mexican-origin residents of the Texas border cities Laredo (n = 751) and McAllen/Brownsville (n = 814), with San Antonio as an off-border comparison (n = 771). Interviews assessed past-year DSM-5 AUD; past-year heavy drinking; coping and enhancement motives; and 7 indicators of substance use climate and stress exposure hypothesized to mediate site effects. Analyses, conducted separately by gender, included regressions and structural equation modeling with Mplus. Results: Preliminary analyses revealed that site effects on AUD prevalence were, unexpectedly, exclusive to men, and that Laredan men were similar to McAllen/Brownsville men on demographics, acculturation, and cross-border mobility. However, sites differed dramatically on most of the hypothesized risk factors. Structural equation models confirmed that site effects on AUD were partially mediated via effects of site on indicators of a permissive climate (i.e., permissive drinking norms, high drug availability) and stress exposures (i.e., high exposure to violence/crime, low family support), and via downstream effects on drinking motives and heavy drinking. Conclusions: Findings of very high rates of past-12-month AUD among Laredan men (35%) suggest the possibility of significant heterogeneity even within demographically similar border areas and underline the need for additional study of the border region. Findings regarding our conceptual model suggest that this model may constitute a useful initial framework for future research on alcohol problems at the border. However, additional research using representative samples is needed to confirm and expand this model to comprehensively address relevant individual and community factors.";Alcohol Dependence | Disparities | Hispanic | Immigration | Latino;16;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;P50AA005595;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

In this report from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we provide national estimates of levels and trends of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and mortality for 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. Methods For countries without high-quality vital registration data, we estimated prevalence and incidence with data from antenatal care clinics and population-based seroprevalence surveys, and with assumptions by age and sex on initial CD4 distribution at infection, CD4 progression rates (probability of progression from higher to lower CD4 cell-count category), on and off antiretroviral therapy (ART) mortality, and mortality from all other causes. Our estimation strategy links the GBD 2015 assessment of all-cause mortality and estimation of incidence and prevalence so that for each draw from the uncertainty distribution all assumptions used in each step are internally consistent. We estimated incidence, prevalence, and death with GBD versions of the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) and Spectrum software originally developed by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). We used an open-source version of EPP and recoded Spectrum for speed, and used updated assumptions from systematic reviews of the literature and GBD demographic data. For countries with high-quality vital registration data, we developed the cohort incidence bias adjustment model to estimate HIV incidence and prevalence largely from the number of deaths caused by HIV recorded in cause-of-death statistics. We corrected these statistics for garbage coding and HIV misclassification. Findings Global HIV incidence reached its peak in 1997, at 3·3 million new infections (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1–3·4 million). Annual incidence has stayed relatively constant at about 2·6 million per year (range 2·5–2·8 million) since 2005, after a period of fast decline between 1997 and 2005. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS has been steadily increasing and reached 38·8 million (95% UI 37·6–40·4 million) in 2015. At the same time, HIV/AIDS mortality has been declining at a steady pace, from a peak of 1·8 million deaths (95% UI 1·7–1·9 million) in 2005, to 1·2 million deaths (1·1–1·3 million) in 2015. We recorded substantial heterogeneity in the levels and trends of HIV/AIDS across countries. Although many countries have experienced decreases in HIV/AIDS mortality and in annual new infections, other countries have had slowdowns or increases in rates of change in annual new infections. Interpretation Scale-up of ART and prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been one of the great successes of global health in the past two decades. However, in the past decade, progress in reducing new infections has been slow, development assistance for health devoted to HIV has stagnated, and resources for health in low-income countries have grown slowly. Achievement of the new ambitious goals for HIV enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 3 and the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets will be challenging, and will need continued efforts from governments and international agencies in the next 15 years to end AIDS by 2030.

About 1% PVA aqueous solutions were prepared by varying the closantel content. The increase of closantel content led to a reduction in the particle size of final solutions. All the solutions were buffered at pH 7.4 and exhibited shear-thinning behavior. Furthermore, in oscillatory flow, a “solid-like” type behavior was observed for the sample containing 30 μg/mL closantel. Indicating a strong interaction between the dispersed and continuous phases and evidencing an interconnected network between the nanoparticle and PVA, this sample also showed the highest shear viscosity and higher shear thinning slope, indicating a more intrincate structure disrupted by shear. In conclusion, PVA interacts with closantel in aqueous solution and the critical concentration for closantel encapsulation by PVA was about 30 μg/mL; above this concentration, the average particle size decreased notoriously which was associated to closantel interacting with the surface of the PVA aggregates and thus avoiding to some extent direct polymer–polymer interaction.";Closantel | nanoparticles | particle size | PVA | shear-thining | viscoelasticity;2;0;;;;undefined;

However, no data about the expression of this protein in oral melanocytic lesions are available to date. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 in oral nevi and melanomas, comparing the results with correspondent cutaneous lesions. Methods: COX-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 49 oral melanocytic lesions, including 36 intramucosal nevi and 13 primary oral melanomas, and in four cutaneous nevi and eight melanomas. Results: All cases of oral and cutaneous melanomas were positive for COX-2. On the other hand, all oral and cutaneous melanocytic nevi were negative. Conclusion: COX-2 is highly positive in oral melanomas and negative in oral nevi and might represent a useful marker to distinguish melanocytic lesions of the oral cavity.;cutaneous melanocytic nevi | cutaneous melanoma | cyclooxygenase-2 | intramucosal melanocytic nevi | oral melanoma;9;0;;;;undefined;

A new assay has been developed that uses the phosphatidylinositol glycan class A gene (Pig-a) as a reporter for measuring in vivo gene mutation. The Pig-a assay can be employed to evaluate mutant frequencies (MFs) in peripheral blood reticulocytes (RETs) and erythrocytes (RBCs) using flow cytometry. In the present study, we assessed the effects of malnutrition on mutagenic susceptibility by exposing undernourished (UN) and well-nourished (WN) rats to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and measuring Pig-a MFs. Two week-old UN and WN male Han-Wistar rats were treated daily with 0, 20, or 40 mg/kg ENU for 3 consecutive days. Blood was collected from the tail vein one day before ENU treatment (Day-1) and after ENU administration on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56 and 63. Pig-a MFs were measured in RETs and RBCs as the RETCD59- and RBCCD59- frequencies. In the vehicle control groups, the frequencies of mutant RETs and RBCs were significantly higher in UN rats compared with WN rats at all sampling times. The ENU treatments increased RET and RBC MFs starting at Day 7. Although ENU-induced Pig-a MFs were consistently lower in UN rats than in WN rats, these differences were not significant. To understand these responses, further studies should use other mutagens and nucleated surrogate cells and examine the types of mutations induced in UN and WN rats.;Erythrocytes | Malnutrition | Mutagenesis | Pig-a assay | Reticulocytes;4;0;;;CONACYT;248814;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We describe the first GWAS of common genetic variation contributing to CRC risk in HL (1611 CRC cases and 4330 controls). We also examine known susceptibility alleles and implement imputation-based finemapping to identify potential ethnicity-specific association signals in known risk regions.

A samples of 452 individuals from 83 different localities, essentially covering its entire mainland distribution, was evaluated using two genetic markers: COI (mitochondrial) and DBY (nuclear) genes.

However,resistance to chemotherapy and to specific small molecule inhibitors is common in cancer patients; thus alternative therapeutic approaches are needed to overcome clinical resistance. Here,we showed that the dietary compound resveratrol suppressed the cell cycle by targeting AURKA and PLK1 kinases. First,we identified genes modulated by resveratrol using a genome-wide analysis of gene expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Transcriptional profiling indicated that 375 genes were modulated at 24 h after resveratrol intervention,whereas 579 genes were regulated at 48 h. Of these,290 genes were deregulated in common at 24 and 48 h. Interestingly,a significant decrease in the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle,DNA repair,cytoskeleton organization,and angiogenesis was detected. In particular,AURKA and PLK1 kinases were downregulated by resveratrol at 24 h. In addition the BRCA1 gene,an AURKA/PLK1 inhibitor,was upregulated at 24 h of treatment. Moreover,two wellknown resveratrol effectors,cyclin D1 (CCND1) and cyclin B1 (CCNB1),were also repressed at both times. Congruently,we found that resveratrol impaired G1/S phase transition in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. By western blot assays,we confirmed that resveratrol suppressed AURKA,CCND1 and CCNB1 at 24 and 48 h. In summary,we showed for the first time that resveratrol regulates cell cycle progression by targeting AURKA and PLK1. Our findings highlight the potential use of resveratrol as an adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.";AURKA | BRCA1 | Breast cancer | Cell cycle | PLK1 | Resveratrol | Transcriptome;35;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

A standardized methodology is presented incorporating various transculturalization factors: resource availability (including imaging equipment and approved pharmaceuticals), health care professional and patient preferences, lifestyle variables, socio-economic parameters, web-based global accessibility, electronic implementation, and need for validation protocols. A standardized CPA template with node-specific recommendations to assist the local transculturalization process is provided. Participants unanimously agreed on the following five overarching principles for LA: (1) there is only one level of optimal endocrine care, (2) hemoglobin A1C should be utilized at every level of diabetes care, (3) nutrition education and increased pharmaceutical options are necessary to optimize the obesity care model, (4) quality neck ultrasound must be part of an optimal thyroid nodule care model, and (5) more scientific evidence is needed on osteoporosis prevalence and cost to justify intervention by governmental health care authorities. This 2015 AACE/ACE Workshop marks the beginning of a structured activity that assists local experts in creating culturally sensitive, evidence-based, and easy-to-implement tools for optimizing endocrine care on a global scale.;;9;0;;;;undefined;

A total of 52 181 healthy volunteers were studied within 138 selected original research papers. CYP2C19∗17 was 42- and 24-fold more frequent in Mediterranean-South Europeans and Middle Easterns than in East Asians (P<0.001, in both cases). Contrarily, CYP2C19∗2 and CYP2C19∗3 alleles were more frequent in East Asians (30.26% and 6.89%, respectively), and even a twofold higher frequency of these alleles was found in Native populations from Oceania (61.30% and 14.42%, respectively; P<0.001, in all cases), which may be a consequence of genetic drift process in the Pacific Islands. Regarding CYP2C19 metabolic phenotype, poor metabolizers (PMs) were more frequent among Asians than in Europeans, contrarily to the phenomenon reported for CYP2D6. A correlation has been found between the frequencies of CYP2C19 poor metabolism 'predicted' from CYP2C19 genotypes (gPMs) and the poor metabolic phenotype 'measured' with a probe drug (mPMs) when subjects are either classified by ethnicity (r=0.94, P<0.001) or geographic region (r=0.99, P=0.002). Nevertheless, further research is needed in African and Asian populations, which are under-represented, and additional CYP2C19 variants and the 'measured' phenotype should be studied.";;91;0;;;;undefined;

Accumulation of high levels of these species in the cell causes damage to macromolecules including several proteins and induces changes in different metabolic processes. Fruit ripening has been characterized as an oxidative phenomenon; therefore, control of reactive oxygen species levels by mitochondrial antioxidants plays a crucial role on this process. In this work, ascorbate-glutathione cycle components, hydrogen peroxide levels and the proteomic profile of carbonylated proteins were analyzed in mitochondria isolated from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit at two ripening stages. A significant increase on most ascorbate-glutathione cycle components and on carbonylated proteins was observed in mitochondria from breaker to light red stage. Enzymes and proteins involved in diverse cellular and mitochondrial metabolic pathways were identified among the carbonylated proteins. These results suggest that protein carbonylation is a post-translational modification involved in tomato fruit ripening regulation.";ASC-GSH cycle | Carbonylated proteins | Reactive oxygen species (ROS) | Ripening | Solanum lycopersicum;27;0;;;UAM;04553/GERM/06;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

Especially, the temporal development of the autonomic regulation has not yet been explicitly analyzed using short-term segments in supine position, transition and orthostatic phase (OP). In this study, nonlinear analysis of cardiovascular and respiratory time series was performed to investigate how nonlinear indices are dynamically changing with respect to gender during orthostatic challenges. The analysis was carried out using shifted short-term segments throughout a head-up tilt test in 24 healthy subjects, 12 men (26 ± 4 years) and 12 age-matched women (26 ± 5 years), at supine position and during OP at 70°. The nonlinear methods demonstrated statistical differences in the autonomic regulation between males and females. Orthostatic stress caused significantly decreased heart rate variability due to increased sympathetic activity mainly in men, already at the beginning and during the complete OP, revealed by (a) increased occurrence of specific word types with constant fluctuations as pW111 from symbolic dynamics, (b) augmented fractal correlation properties by the short-term index alpha1 from detrended fluctuation analysis, (c) increased slope indices (21ati and 31ati) from auto-transinformation and (d) augmented time irreversibility indices demonstrating more temporal asymmetries and nonlinear dynamics in men than in women. After tilt-up, both men and women increased their sympathetic activity but in a different way. Time-dependent gender differences during orthostatic challenge were shown directly between men and women or indirectly comparing baseline and different temporal stages of OP. The proposed dynamical study of autonomic regulation has the advantage of screening the fluctuations of the sympathetic and vagal activities that can be quantified by the temporal behavior of nonlinear indices. The findings in this paper strongly suggest the need for gender separation in studies of the dynamics of autonomic regulation during orthostatic challenge.;Autonomic regulation | heart rate variability | nonlinear dynamics | orthostatic stress;15;0;;;;undefined;

Most demographic studies suggest that early life stages of germination and seedling recruitment are crucial and often a limitation for population growth. The population dynamics of Neobuxbaumia polylopha (DC) Backeb. was modeled for a three-year period to assess the contribution of the early life cycle stages on population growth rate (. λ). Two annual size-classified matrix population models were constructed for standard analysis, applied a life table response experiment (LTRE) analysis to explore the contributions of demographic processes, plant size, and temporal variability (years) to λ, and changes in the matrix elements were simulated including a seed bank, and seed-to-seedling transition using observed and experimental data. The population growth rates for 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 were 0.9916 (0.9906-0.9929) and 1.0216 (1.011-1.0280) respectively, suggesting two opposite growth rates for the studied period. The increase in λ in 2013-2014 was driven primarily by the increased growth and seedling recruitment and survival of small individuals. The rate of recruitment was higher in 2013-2014 with a left-skewed stable size distribution. Elasticity values were high for matrix entries corresponding to individuals remaining in the same category (stasis), followed by growth, retrogression and fecundity. The simulations show that the seed bank has a minor effect in comparison with the seed-seedling transition which became the population bottleneck under the assumption that seeds are not limited, so programs designed to preserve N. polylopha populations must focus on seedling establishment.;Elasticity | Establishment | Matrix population models | Seed-seedling limitation;9;0;;;CONACYT;165908;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Experimental design: 2DE and ESI/multistage MS (ESI-MS/MS) were performed to identify modulated proteins in A549 cells treated with EGCG. Cell migration was evaluated by transwell assays. RNA interference was used to silence the hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF). Caspase-3, caspase-9, and HDGF were immunodetected by Western blot assays. Flow cytometry was used for detection of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. Results: We found that HDGF expression was threefold suppressed by EGCG treatment. Downregulation of HDGF by EGCG was confirmed using anti-HDGF antibodies in three lung cancer cell lines. EGCG treatment and HDGF abrogation by RNA interference resulted in a decreased migration of A549 cells. In addition, EGCG induced a marked synergistic effect with cisplatin in cell death. Consistently, an enhanced cytotoxicity in HDGF-silenced cells was also found. Cell death was associated to increased apoptosis, disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Conclusion and clinical relevance: Our data suggest for the first time that abrogation of HDGF by EGCG enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis and sensitize A549 cells to chemotherapy.

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS for T2D in the Japanese population. Combined data from discovery and subsequent validation analyses (23,399 T2D cases and 31,722 controls) identify 7 new loci with genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10-8), rs1116357 near CCDC85A, rs147538848 in FAM60A, rs1575972 near DMRTA1, rs9309245 near ASB3, rs67156297 near ATP8B2, rs7107784 near MIR4686 and rs67839313 near INAFM2. Of these, the association of 4 loci with T2D is replicated in multi-ethnic populations other than Japanese (up to 65,936 T2Ds and 158,030 controls, P<0.007). These results indicate that expansion of single ethnic GWAS is still useful to identify novel susceptibility loci to complex traits not only for ethnicity-specific loci but also for common loci across different ethnicities.;;105;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;BC050791;National Institutes of Health

Cancer cells have a similar behavior, presenting the same mechanisms and characteristics of tissue formation. In this article, we model and simulate the formation of different communication channels that allow an interaction between two cells. This is a first step in order to simulate in the future processes that occur in healthy tissue when normal cells surround a cancer cell and to interrupt the communication, thus preventing the spread of malignancy into these cells. The purpose of this study is to propose key molecules, which can be targeted to allow us to break the communication between cancer cells and surrounding normal cells. The simulation is carried out using a flexible bioinformatics platform that we developed, which is itself based on the metaphor chemistry-based model.;Bioinformatics framework | Cancer cells | In silico experiments | Intracellular communication;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

In Mexico, they reproduce in arid and semi-arid zones of Mexico and several states (Puebla, Tlaxcala, Hidalgo). Samples were gathered to determine reproduction conditions and perform an insect analysis to generate data composition in macronutrients, on dry basis, according to AOAC methods. The obtained data were: proteins: 42.12-50.63%; lipids: 30.27-34.96%; minerals: 6.53-7.85%; fibres: 1.91-2.56%; and soluble carbohydrates: 6.80-18.27%. Entomological material was collected in spring 2014, 3 nests for each zone, all from different altitudes and agroclimatic regions. Samples were representative for the insect supply in the areas studied. Insects are high in proteins and lipids, compared with most of the commonly consumed food, due to their high content of fatty acids; they must be refrigerated for later consumption. Minerals are moderated. Fibre and soluble carbohydrate levels are low, but an excess of proteins can be converted into carbohydrates via gluconeogenesis. Escamoles reproduce once a year in the spring, but sometimes one nest can provide escamoles eggs twice in the same season, once at the beginning and again at the end, depending on the biotic and abiotic conditions of their environment. Escamoles are a good source of nutrients; however, some rural people sell them to obtain extra income rather than consume them to improve their nutritional condition and welfare.";Chemical composition | Edible insects | Environment | Escamoles;1;0;;;;undefined;

This review provides an update of recent studies about obesity consequences on health and how a healthy diet, including dietary fiber, can helps to keep a healthy body weight and avoiding several diseases related to this condition. Several studies have reported that a healthy and balanced diet helps to control human weight, added to this, a diet rich in dietary fiber (from natural sources or produced biotechnologically) helps to keep a body weight regulation, control of lipid and triglycerides levels because of its chemical, physical and biochemical features. One of the these features is hormonal regulation through dietary fiber consumption, in as much as that several appetite and satiety hormones in the organism are activated in presence of dietary fiber and provides an effect of satiety which causes a decrease in food consumption. Therefore, consumption of dietary fiber of several sources could be an alternative for controlling obesity-related diseases and preventing this condition.;Body weight regulation | Cancer | Diabetes | Ghrelin | Glucagón like peptide-1;8;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

Our experiments with 21 subjects showed that the SWLDA's performance using our shape-feature vector was 93 %, that is, 10 % higher than the one obtained with BCI2000-feature's vector. The shape-feature vector is 34-dimensional for every electrode; however, it is possible to significantly reduce its dimensionality while keeping a high sensitivity. The validation of the calibration algorithm showed an averaged area under the ROC (AUROC) curve of 0.88. Also, most of the subjects needed less than 15 trials to have an AUROC superior to 0.8.

Although Datura stramonium's concentration of tropane alkaloids is under selection by leaf beetles, it is not known whether chemical defense reduces seed predation by the specialist weevil, Trichobaris soror, and if it is evolving by natural selection. We measured infestation by T. soror as well as the concentration of the plants' two main tropane alkaloids in 278 D. stramonium plants belonging to 31 populations in central Mexico. We assessed whether the seed predator exerted preferences on the levels of both alkaloids and whether they affect plant fitness. Results show great variation across populations in the concentration of scopolamine and atropine in both leaves and seeds of plants of D. stramonium, as well as in the intensity of infestation and the proportion of infested fruits by T. soror. The concentration of scopolamine in seeds and leaves are negatively associated across populations. We found that scopolamine concentration increases plant fitness. Our major finding was the detection of a positive relationship between the population average concentrations of scopolamine with the selection differentials of scopolamine. Such spatial variation in the direction and intensity of selection on scopolamine may represent a coevolutionary selective mosaic. Our results support the view that variation in the concentration of scopolamine among-populations of D. stramonium in central Mexico is being driven, in part, by selection exerted by T. soror, pointing an adaptive role of tropane alkaloids in this plant species.;Atropine | Datura stramonium | Natural selection | Plant resistance | Scopolamine | Seed predation | Selection differential | Trichobaris soror | Tropane alkaloids;8;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

A large majority of the medicinal plant compounds, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, and terpenes, have therapeutic properties. Polyphenols are the most common active compounds in herbs and vegetables consumed by man. The biological bioactivity of polyphenols against neurodegeneration is mainly due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiamyloidogenic effects.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of refrigerated storage at 12.5. °C on tomato aroma profile, sensory quality, and consumer's flavor perception. C6 and 3-methyl butanol volatile levels were determined by GC. Enzyme activity and gene expression of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and lipoxygenase (LOX), involved in the oxylipin biosynthetic pathway were also determined. A quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) and a consumer test were carried out to compare the effect of refrigerated storage on flavor perception at 10. °C and 12.5. °C to non-refrigerated tomatoes. Refrigerated storage at 12.5. °C caused a general decrease on total aroma volatiles that were detected from 9. d onward. A lack of accumulation of hexanal, hexanol and cis-3-hexenol, a transitory increase of trans-2-hexenol and the accumulation of 3-methyl butanol were observed. Trained judges perceived these changes as an increase of the musty/damp descriptor which was higher in fruit stored at 10. °C than at 12.5. °C. Tomatoes stored at 10. °C were the less preferred by consumers perceived as less fresh and with the presence of off odors.

Diameter trees were associated with phenology. Using dendrometer bands growth diameter was measured every two months for two years, establishing six diameter categories, three symmetries and three crown lighting, adjusting the growth increments to a mathematical model. Growth periodicity was determined by performing markings on the cambium of a tree at 1.30 m (DBH) every two months and obtaining the corresponding slice at the end of the experiment to determine whether annual rings were formed. Hura polyandra defoliates from March to May, flowers from March to July, bear fruits from March to September and sprouts the leaves from July to January. Significant correlations occurred between the development of leaves buds with precipitation (P = 0.01) and flowering with temperature (P = 0.01). The growth is higher and significant (P = 0.001) in diameter categories 10, 15 and 20 cm. Crown lighting helps significantly (P = 0.01) greater increases in diameter.

This was conducted in two sets of experiments, with the VMN and POA investigated in the first set, and the MePD and BNST in the second set. The VMN and POA received intense projections from the MePD and BNST. We used a short hairpin RNA encoded within an adeno-associated viral vector directed against the gene for ERα to reduce the number of ERα in the VMN or POA (first set of experiments) or in the BNST or MePD (second set of experiments) in female rats. The rats were housed in groups of four ovariectomised females and three males in a seminatural environment for 8 days. Compared with traditional test set-ups, the seminatural environment provides an arena in which the rats can express their full behavioural repertoire, which allowed us to investigate multiple aspects of social and sexual behaviour in groups of rats. Behavioural observation was performed after oestrogen and progesterone injections. A reduction of ERα expression in the VMN or POA diminished the display of paracopulatory behaviours and lordosis responses compared to controls, whereas the lordosis quotient remained unaffected. This suggests that ERα in the VMN and POA play an important role in intrinsic sexual motivation. The reduction in ERα did not affect the social behaviour of the females, although the males sniffed and pursued the females with reduced ERα less than the controls. This suggests that the ERα in the VMN and POA is involved in the regulation of sexual attractiveness of females. The ERα in the MePD and BNST, on the other hand, plays no role in sociosexual behaviour.;Oestrogen receptor | Rats | Seminatural environment | Sexual behaviour | Social behaviour;22;0;repositoryam;Green;JSPS;15H05724;Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

Cell immobilization in alginate beads did not improve the biotechnological production of these four taxanes. In contrast, the highest productivity of taxol (53 μg L−1 d−1) was achieved in MeJ-elicited free cells under T2 and cell immobilization in these conditions increased productivity by more than twofold (130.35 μg L−1 d−1).;Cell immobilization | Cell suspension cultures | Methyl jasmonate | Sodium alginate | Taxanes | Taxol | Taxus globosa;7;0;;;;248629;

However, the threat status of only a small number has been evaluated compared with key animal groups, rendering the magnitude and nature of the risks plants face unclear. Here we report the results of a global species assessment for the largest plant taxon evaluated to date under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Categories and Criteria, the iconic Cactaceae (cacti). We show that cacti are among the most threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date, with 31% of the 1,478 evaluated species threatened, demonstrating the high anthropogenic pressures on biodiversity in arid lands. The distribution of threatened species and the predominant threatening processes and drivers are different to those described for other taxa. The most significant threat processes comprise land conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, collection as biological resources, and residential and commercial development. The dominant drivers of extinction risk are the unscrupulous collection of live plants and seeds for horticultural trade and private ornamental collections, smallholder livestock ranching and smallholder annual agriculture. Our findings demonstrate that global species assessments are readily achievable for major groups of plants with relatively moderate resources, and highlight different conservation priorities and actions to those derived from species assessments of key animal groups.;;182;0;repositoryam;Green;GCA;0000000000118202;Garden Club of America

The reproductive cycle of P. gigantea was monitored monthly over a two-year period (2010–2012) at four sites along the coast of Oaxaca (southwestern Mexico). Except for one hermaphroditic colony, P. gigantea was gonochoric and exhibited asynchronous development. The data suggest that, in the study area, the species may reproduce seasonally, with minor interannual differences (May–September 2010, April–August 2011, April–May 2012). There were spatial and temporal variations in the percentage of reproductively active colonies and the presence of mature sex cells. A multiple regression analysis revealed that the percentage of reproductively active colonies was significantly explained (69.6%) by mesoscale variations in environmental variables such as sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, diffuse attenuation coefficient, percentage of lunar illumination, and photoperiod, the latter being the most relevant variable in the model. The data suggest that temporal mesoscale variations can exert a meaningful influence on coral reproduction in the study area.;Coral | Gametogenesis | Reproduction | Spawning;13;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Barley rootless had better organic matter (OM) degradability than BS after 24 h incubation with PS. The protein content in BR was higher than in BS (P < 0.01). Enzyme activities had the highest concentration from the start of fermentation, and in vitro dry matter (DM) degradability in BS and BR increased after 8 and 24 d fermentation, respectively (P < 0.05). Propionic acid concentration was enhanced after 16 d fermentation in BR (P < 0.5).

This study analyses the effect of enrichment with double bunk and cereal straw on behaviour, use of space, stress response, productive traits and meat quality variables during the finishing phase of fattening lambs. Sixty lambs were placed in enriched (ED) or conventional (CO) pens (3 pens each treatment, 10 lambs/pen) where ED had a double bunk with ramps and cereal straw as bedding and forage. The CO pen was barren, similar to commercial feedlots, without straw or any other enrichment. The proposed ED had a positive effect on the behavioural characteristics of the lambs, which displayed a richer behavioural repertoire, fewer stereotypes and more affiliative interactions, improving group cohesion. Moreover, ED lambs had enhanced immunity and there were no discernible detrimental effects on performance or on the commercial quality of their meat. However, the enriched system proposed may pose difficulties for feedlot handling procedures.;Environmental enrichment | Indoor feedlot | Lamb welfare | Meat quality | Performance;5;0;repositoryam;Green;MINECO;AGL- 2009/10794;Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad

The motor deficit in these patients may be attributable to the degradation of projection fibers associated with the underlying neurodegenerative process. However, this relationship remains unclear. Statistical analysis of diffusion tensor imaging enables an unbiased whole-brain quantitative comparison of the diffusion proprieties of white matter tracts in vivo. Methods: Fourteen genetically confirmed SCA2 patients and aged-matched healthy controls participated in the study. Tract-based spatial statistics were performed to analyze structural white matter damage using two different measurements: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Significant diffusion differences were correlated with the patient's ataxia impairment. Results: Our analysis revealed decreased FA mainly in the inferior/middle/superior cerebellar peduncles, the bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule and the bilateral superior corona radiata. Increases in MD were found mainly in cerebellar white matter, medial lemniscus, and middle cerebellar peduncle, among other regions. Clinical impairment measured with the SARA score correlated with FA in superior parietal white matter and bilateral anterior corona radiata. Correlations with MD were found in cerebellar white matter and the middle cerebellar peduncle. Conclusion: Our findings show significant correlations between diffusion measurements in key areas affected in SCA2 and measures of motor impairment, suggesting a disruption of information flow between motor and sensory-integration areas. These findings result in a more comprehensive view of the clinical impact of the white matter degeneration in SCA2. Copyright:;;20;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The mixtures were designed to obtain the final composition of a cracked soybean (CS) supplement consisting of 25% protein and 18% oil. The supplements were added at 3.3% (w/w) to compost at spawning. We used two control groups: compost without supplement (UC) and compost with CS. Production was measured in three flushes; the CS supplements in the CCBCGVO mixture reached a cumulative production above 34kg/m<sup>2</sup> (P<0.05). Samples were taken in the compost at spawning (Day 0), primordia formation (25 d), and at the end of the first, second, and third breaks (39, 48, and 60 d, respectively); enzymatic activities (cellulase, xylanase, and laccase) were also determined. For cellulase and xylanse activities, a positive correlation was found between production values and the increase in these enzymes, in presence of supplements. The maximum value in laccase activity was at 25 d (beginning of primordia formation), activity decreased in the production stages, and it increased again at day 60 (end of the third stage).

This study explores the influence of parental mental disorders across the lifespan. Data are from the Sao Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey, a crosssectional household study with a representative sample of the adult population living in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area, Brazil (N=2,942). Survival models examined bivariate and multivariate associations between a range of parental disorders and offspring suicidality. After controlling for comorbidity, number of mental disorders and offspring psychopathology, we found that parental psychopathology influences suicidal behaviors throughout most part of the life cycle, from childhood until young adult years. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and antisocial personality were associated with offspring suicidal ideation (OR 1.8 and 1.9, respectively), panic and GAD predicted suicidal attempts (OR 2.3 and 2.7, respectively), and panic was related to the transition from ideation to attempts (OR 2.7). Although noticed in many different stages of the lifespan, this influence is most evident during adolescence. In this period, depression and antisocial personality increased the odds of suicidal ideation (OR 5.1 and 3.2, respectively), and depression, panic disorder, GAD and substance abuse predicted suicidal attempts (OR varying from 1.7 to 3.8). In short, parental disorders characterized by impulsive-aggression and anxiety-agitation were the main predictors of offspring suicidality across the lifespan. This clinically relevant intergenerational transmission of suicide risk was independent of offspring mental disorders, and this underscores the need for a family approach to psychopathology.;;18;1;repositoryam;Green;MOE;undefined;Ministry of Education

Our results show that B. ternifolia extract and ethyl acetate fraction induced anti-inflammatory effects by reducing inflammation by >70 %, while antioxidant test revealed significant IC50 values for flavonoid content fraction (30.67 ± 2.09 μg/ml) and ethyl acetate fraction (42.66 ± 0.93 μg/ml). The maximum inhibition of acetylcholinesterase was exhibited by scopoletin content fraction (38.43 ± 3.94 %), while ethyl acetate fraction exerted neuroprotective effect against β-amyloid peptide (83.97 ± 5.03 %). Phytochemical analysis, showed the presence of 3-O-quercetin glucopyranoside (415 mg/g), rutin (229.9 mg/g), ursolic and oleanolic acid (54 and 20.8 mg/g respectively), 3-O-quercetin rhamnopyranoside (12.8 mg/g), chlorogenic acid (9.5 mg/g), and scopoletin (1.38 mg/g). Our findings support the use of B. ternifolia since the extract induced significant neuroprotection against β-amyloid peptide, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-acetylcholinesterase effects that could be attributed to its contents of polyphenols, coumarins, and triterpenes, and encourage further studies for development of this extract as therapeutic agent in treatment of Alzheimer's disease.;Alzheimer's disease | Bouvardia ternifolia | Cumarins | Polyphenols | Triterpens;17;0;;;;undefined;

Consequently, regulatory pathways that regulate specific stress responses are potential targets to manipulate to increase antibiotic titers. In this study, genes encoding key proteins involved in regulation of the osmotic stress response in Streptomyces avermitilis, the industrial producer of avermectins, are investigated as targets. Disruption of either osaBSa, encoding a response regulator protein, or osaCSa, encoding a multidomain regulator of the alternative sigma factor SigB, led to increased production of both oligomycin, by up to 200%, and avermectin, by up to 37%. The mutations also conditionally affected morphological development; under osmotic stress, the mutants were unable to erect an aerial mycelium. In addition, we demonstrate the delivery of DNA into a streptomycete using biolistics.

Current estimates of cancer burden in individual countries and regions are necessary to inform local cancer control strategies. OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 28 cancers in 188 countries by sex from 1990 to 2013. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The general methodology of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study was used. Cancer registries were the source for cancer incidence data as well as mortality incidence (MI) ratios. Sources for cause of death data include vital registration system data, verbal autopsy studies, and other sources. The MI ratios were used to transform incidence data to mortality estimates and cause of death estimates to incidence estimates. Cancer prevalence was estimated using MI ratios as surrogates for survival data; YLDs were calculated by multiplying prevalence estimates with disability weights, which were derived from population-based surveys; YLLs were computed by multiplying the number of estimated cancer deaths at each age with a reference life expectancy; and DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. FINDINGS: In 2013 there were 14.9 million incident cancer cases, 8.2 million deaths, and 196.3 million DALYs. Prostate cancer was the leading cause for cancer incidence (1.4 million) for men and breast cancer for women (1.8 million). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer was the leading cause for cancer death in men and women, with 1.6 million deaths. For men, TBL cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (24.9 million). For women, breast cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (13.1 million). Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) per 100 000 and age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) per 100 000 for both sexes in 2013 were higher in developing vs developed countries for stomach cancer (ASIR, 17 vs 14; ASDR, 15 vs 11), liver cancer (ASIR, 15 vs 7; ASDR, 16 vs 7), esophageal cancer (ASIR, 9 vs 4; ASDR, 9 vs 4), cervical cancer (ASIR, 8 vs 5; ASDR, 4 vs 2), lip and oral cavity cancer (ASIR, 7 vs 6; ASDR, 2 vs 2), and nasopharyngeal cancer (ASIR, 1.5 vs 0.4; ASDR, 1.2 vs 0.3). Between 1990 and 2013, ASIRs for all cancers combined (except nonmelanoma skin cancer and Kaposi sarcoma) increased by more than 10% in 113 countries and decreased by more than 10% in 12 of 188 countries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cancer poses a major threat to public health worldwide, and incidence rates have increased in most countries since 1990. The trend is a particular threat to developing nations with health systems that are ill-equipped to deal with complex and expensive cancer treatments. The annual update on the Global Burden of Cancer will provide all stakeholders with timely estimates to guide policy efforts in cancer prevention, screening, treatment, and palliation.";;2148;1;repositoryam;Green;NIH;T32HL007093;National Institutes of Health

Methods: The current analyses were restricted to 948 subjects who endorsed drinking at least one drink per week in the past year from a sample of 5037 individuals. Data came from São Paulo Megacity Project (which is part of World Mental Health Surveys) collected between 2005 and 2007. First, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out to test for the best dimensional structure for DSM-5-AUD criteria. Then, item response theory (IRT) was used to investigate the severity and discrimination properties of each criterion of DSM-5-AUD. Finally, differential criterion functioning (DCF) were investigated by socio-demographics (income, gender, age, employment status, marital status and education). All analyses were performed in Mplus software taking into account complex survey design features. Results: The best EFA model was a one-dimensional model. IRT results showed that the criteria ""Time Spent"" and ""Given Up"" have the highest discrimination and severity properties, while the criterion ""Larger/Longer"" had the lowest value of severity, but an average value of discrimination. Only female gender had DCF both at criterion- and factor-level, rendering measurement bias. Conclusion: This study reinforces the existence of a DSM-5-AUD continuum in the largest metropolitan area of South America, including subgroups that had previously higher rates of alcohol use (lower educational/income levels). Lower DSM-5-AUD scores were found in women.";Differential item functioning | DSM-5 | Exploratory factor analysis | Item response theory | Latin America | Megacities;15;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;002/2003;National Institutes of Health

However, its contribution to the amount and distribution of body fat is under investigation. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between genetic variation in ApoE and obesity-related traits in Mexican school children. Material and Methods: Anthropometric, body composition and physical activity measures were conducted using standard methods in 300 children (177 girls/123 boys) who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. DNA was isolated from saliva. ApoE genotypes were analyzed by allelic discrimination. The association between variation in ApoE and anthropometric and body composition measures was investigated using the General Linear Model. Results: The mean ± SD values for age, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were 9.05 ± 0.80 years, 19.01 ± 3.83 and 67.98 ± 10.97 cm, respectively. Approximately 46% of the participants were overweight or obese. A significant association between ApoE isoforms and WC was found after controlling for age, sex and the percentage of physical activity (p = 0.025). Significant main effects were found for vigorous physical activity and light physical activity influencing the adiposity-related BMI (p < 0.001) and WC (p = 0.044), respectively. Conclusions: Variation in ApoE and physical activity intensity were associated with adiposity-related phenotypes in Mexican school children.;Apolipoprotein E | Body composition | Childhood obesity | Genetic variation;5;0;;;;undefined;

The tree ferns Alsophila firma, Cyathea divergens and Lophosoria quadripinnata coexist in a cloud forest in Mexico; the first is abundant in creeks, the second occupies slightly open places, and the third prefers more open sites. We hypothesized that the distribution of these species would be correlated with their germination patterns. To test the hypothesis we evaluated the effect of light, water potential and canopy openness on spore germination. Spores were incubated under different light filters modifying red:far-red ratio or light intensity, water potential was modified with polyethylene glycol solutions and distinct canopy openness were selected in the field. No germination occurred in darkness, and it was low under red light and far-red light; however, all species germinated at a very low photon flux density (PFD, 0.04 μmol m-2 s-1). The decrease of water potential from 0 MPa to -0.7 MPa reduced germination in all species, from 98.6% to 72.2% in L. quadripinnata, 66.4% to 18.9% in A. firma and 74.2% to 4.1% in C. divergens. The increase of the canopy openness reduced the germination capacity of the three species, but L. quadripinnata was the least affected. The germination requirements of the three tree fern species were partially related to the distribution of the sporophytes in the cloud forest.";Alsophila | cloud forest | Cyathea | gap size | Lophosoria;8;0;;;;undefined;

Whether the co-occurrence of alcohol and drug use and disorders is also high in the border area is unknown. Methods: Data are from the U.S.-Mexico Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected respondents interviewed from 2011 to 2013. Participants included 1,690 Mexican Americans from Texas (572 in an off-border city and 1,118 from 3 border cities) and 1,293 Mexicans from Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas (415 in an off-border city and 878 from 3 Mexican cities bordering Texas) who reported drinking in the last 12 months. Participants were interviewed regarding the prevalence of and risk factors for: (i) co-occurring hazardous alcohol use (5+/4+ at least monthly) and drug use (medical and illicit) and (ii) co-occurring presence of a DSM-5 alcohol use disorder (AUD) and 2 symptoms (hazardous use and quit/control) of drug use disorder (DUD symptoms). Results: Co-occurring hazardous alcohol and drug use was more common in the U.S. border cities (14.7%) than off-border (7.2%), but similar for Mexican border (1.2%) and off-border (1.4%) cities. Co-occurrence of AUD and DUD symptoms was likewise more common at the U.S. border (6.8%) than off-border (3.3%), as well as at the Mexican border (1.3%), compared to off-border (0.6%), but not statistically significant for Mexico. In models adjusting for demographics, mobility factors and exposure to the U.S. culture, border residence in both countries related to a nearly twofold increase in prevalence ratios (PRs) of co-occurring AUD and DUD symptoms (PR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.36 to 2.85). Conclusions: Increased rates of co-occurring AUDs and DUDs suggest an added negative impact on already difficult conditions of the border population.;Alcohol use | Co-Occurrence | Drug use | DSM-5 | U.S.-Mexico border;19;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;R01AA018365;National Institutes of Health

In the present study, the relationship of proximity of living at the border and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) is analyzed from the U.S.-Mexico Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions (UMSARC). Methods: Household surveys were conducted on 2336 Mexican Americans in Texas (771 in a non-border city and 1565 from three border cities located in the three poorest counties in the U.S.) and 2460 Mexicans from the states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas in Mexico (811 in a non-border city and 1649 from three cities which are sister cities to the Texas border sites). Results: Among current drinkers, prevalence of AUD was marginally greater (p < 0.10) at the U.S. border compared to the non-border, but the opposite was true in Mexico (p < 0.001), and these trends continued on both sides across volume and 5+ drinking days. Prevalence was greater in Laredo/Nuevo Laredo relative to their respective sister city counterparts on the same side. Border effects appeared greater for males than females in the U.S. and the opposite in Mexico. Conclusion: The data suggest that border proximity may affect AUD in both the U.S. and Mexico, but in the opposite direction, and may be related to the relative perceived or actual stress of living in the respective communities.";Alcohol use disorders | Drinking patterns | U.S./Mexico border;22;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;R01 AA01836540;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

These records are higher than those reported on previous studies carried out in the area. México is the country with the highest number of brittle stars reported in the Tropical Eastern Pacific; this may be due to its exceptional oceanographic conditions, location and coastline extension. However, a total of 27 species reported in the literature were considered doubtful due to their general distributions and were not included in the checklist.

A total of 44 cull ewes were used: 22 were transported by road for 4 hours (200 km), and compared to 22 similar ewes that were not transported. Live body weight the day before and immediately after transportation were recorded and the weight loss during transportation was calculated. Blood samples were taken one day before transport and at four time points post-transport (0, 4 and 24 h) to evaluate physiological responses to stress. Direct observations were carried out to collect information on individual behaviour and the time it took the ewes to drink water, eat and rest after returning to their pen, respectively. Transported ewes had higher body temperatures until 12 h post-transport. Physiological responses to stress were higher immediately after unloading in transported ewes but mostly returned to normal after 4 hours, with complete recovery after 24 hours. Behavioural analysis demonstrated that transported ewes chose to eat before drinking and spent less time resting than controls in the first three hours after unloading. Although there is evidence to suggest that stress responses may be more severe and prolonged in aged animals, we found that cull ewes recovery 24 hours after transport.";Behaviour | Body temperature profiles | Cull ewes | Dry hot climates | Road transport;0;0;;;;undefined;

Protein hydrolyzates were generated with gelatin and crude protein substrates from body wall, and peptidic fractions lower and higher than 3 kDa were obtained to evaluate their oxygen radical scavenging capacity (ORAC). The 3 kDa-fraction obtained from the crude protein hydrolyzate showed the highest ORAC value (0.92 ± 0.04 μmol Trolox equivalent/mg protein).

The use of the space was significantly higher (p<0.05) for the straw area, where there was also more resting and affiliative interactions (p<0.05). In the areas without straw, animals walked more, remained standing longer periods (p<0.05) and had more stereotypic and aggressive behaviour (p<0.05). The study demonstrated that, when given the choice between two areas with similar resources, lambs prefer straw bedding. Straw is suggested to promote affiliation improving the adaptation to the feedlot.

Three classes of genes regulating 5-HT function are constitutively expressed or induced in these cells: (a) membrane proteins that regulate the response to 5-HT, such as SERT, 5HTR-GPCR, and the 5HTion channels; (b) downstream signaling transduction proteins; and (c) enzymes controlling 5-HT metabolism, such as IDO and MAO, which can generate biologically active catabolites, including melatonin, kynurenines, and kynurenamines. This review covers the clinical and experimental mechanisms involved in 5-HT-induced immunomodulation. These mechanisms are cell-specific and depend on the expression of serotonergic components in immune cells. Consequently, 5-HT can modulate several immunological events, such as chemotaxis, leukocyte activation, proliferation, cytokine secretion, anergy, and apoptosis. The effects of 5-HT on immune cells may be relevant in the clinical outcome of pathologies with an inflammatory component. Major depression, fibromyalgia, Alzheimer disease, psoriasis, arthritis, allergies, and asthma are all associated with changes in the serotonergic system associated with leukocytes. Thus, pharmacological regulation of the serotonergic system may modulate immune function and provide therapeutic alternatives for these diseases.";;132;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Material and Methods. Using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for ameloblastoma, 110 cases were selected. The cases were classified as solid/multicystic and unicystic ameloblastomas. Cellular counts of cytoplasmic immunoexpression were assessed for cytoplasmic Survivin, Bcl-2, and Bax, while the nuclear immunoexpression of Survivin and Ki-67 was assessed using label index. Results. Cytoplasmic Survivin and Bcl-2 showed higher percentages of immunoexpression in solid multicystic ameloblastomas compared to unicystic ameloblastomas (P<0.05). Bax, Ki-67, and nuclear Survivin were expressed in higher percentages in unicystic ameloblastomas. Conclusions.

The study included 270 hybrid piglets born of York-Landrace dams and Pietrain sires. The piglets were weaned and then transported at 8 days old (n ≤ 90), 15 days old (n ≤ 90) or 22 days old (n ≤ 90). The duration of each trip, from the time the transport vehicle left the original site until its arrival at the destination (site 2) on the same farm, was 1 h. The piglets in each one of the three groups were divided into two subgroups: (1) transported over unpaved roads with straw bedding; (2) transported over unpaved roads without straw bedding. Three repetitions were performed for each experimental condition. To assess physiological responses to the stress caused by transport, blood samples were taken as soon as the piglets arrived at site 2. The blood variables evaluated were: pH, haematocrit (%), glucose (mg/dL), electrolytes (Na+, K+ and Ca2+) (mmol/L), lactate levels (mg/dL), partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and oxygen (pO2) (mm Hg), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and total carbon dioxide (TCO2C). Piglets that were weaned at 8 and 15 days of age and then transported without straw bedding were found to be more susceptible to metabolic, acid-base, hydric, and gas exchange imbalances (P < 0.05). Blood concentrations of pO2, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and pH were not affected by transport in piglets weaned at 22 days of age in vehicles using straw bedding. Hence, we conclude that regardless of age and trip conditions, the transport of recently weaned piglets constitutes a stressful situation, because just 1 h of transport time was sufficient to cause imbalances in their physiological blood indicators.";animal welfare | pigs | stress | transport | weaning;3;0;;;;undefined;

Consequently, these studies are not well supported by ecological data, or they lack an analysis of socio-ecological integration, making it difficult to implement the strategies derived from these conservation plans. Structural equations models (SEM) help with the understanding of direct and indirect interactions between variables and, consequently, allow the detection of root causes of change. In this study, a method to integrate indicators in relation to a pressure-state-response model was developed and applied to a forest in Mexico City. We developed the model using 21 environmental units, 17 state indicators of biodiversity (evaluating three aspects of the ecosystem: structure, composition and function), 14 environmental indicators (abiotic variables) and 6 anthropogenic pressure indicators. Subsequently, based on multicollinearity tests, redundant indicators were eliminated. A canonical correspondence analysis was carried out to establish the relationship between different indicators and the possible ecological connections of the SEM. With the previous information, an a priori model of the influence of pressure and environmental indicators on the structure, composition and function of the ecosystem was developed. The SEM results enabled us to evaluate the direct and indirect causes of degradation. Some environmental factors, such as the global site factor, humidity, air temperature, organic matter in the soil, slope, and soil pH, had a greater effect on the structure, composition and function indicators registered in the environmental units of the basin than other factors. The pressure factors that most affected the three aspects of the ecosystem were visitors, rubbish, fire incidence, and human activities. Pressure factors affected composition and structure indicators, though the effect on the function indicators was weak. It is possible to conclude that although the ecosystem appears to be changed by some disturbance factors, these factors have not yet altered the functionality of the ecosystem. Finally, from the model, a set of proposals and strategies for management was developed. These strategies can be used to sustain the biodiversity of each environmental unit.;Conservation status | Ecosystem management | Environmental indicators | Pressure-state-response model | Structural equation modeling | Temperate forests;31;0;;;;undefined;

The aim of this study is to investigate urine fluoride concentration as a toxicity factor in a rural community in the state of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Materials and Methods. A sample of 111 children exposed to high concentrations of fluoride in drinking water (4.13 mg/L) was evaluated. Fluoride exposure was determined by measuring urine fluoride concentration using the potentiometric method with an ion selective electrode. The diagnosis of dental fluorosis was performed by clinical examination, and the severity of damage was determined using Dean's index and the Thylstrup-Fejerskov (TF) index. Results. The range of exposure in the study population, evaluated through the fluoride content in urine, was 1.1 to 5.9 mg/L, with a mean of 3.14 ± 1.09 mg/L. Dental fluorosis was present in all subjects, of which 95% had severe cases. Higher urine fluoride levels and greater degrees of severity occurred in older children. Conclusions. The results show that dental fluorosis was determined by the presence of fluoride exposure finding a high positive correlation between the severity of fluorosis and urine fluoride concentration and the years of exposure suggested a cumulative effect.;;15;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Individuals with these symptoms sometimes have been characterized as having subthreshold PTSD, but no consensus exists on the optimal definition of this term. Data from a large cross-national epidemiologic survey are used in this study to provide a principled basis for such a definition. METHODS: The World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys administered fully structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews to community samples in 13 countries containing assessments of PTSD associated with randomly selected TEs. Focusing on the 23,936 respondents reporting lifetime TE exposure, associations of approximated DSM-5 PTSD symptom profiles with six outcomes (distress-impairment, suicidality, comorbid feardistress disorders, PTSD symptom duration) were examined to investigate implications of different subthreshold definitions. RESULTS: Although consistently highest outcomes for distress-impairment, suicidality, comorbidity, and PTSD symptom duration were observed among the 3.0% of respondents with DSM-5 PTSD rather than other symptom profiles, the additional 3.6% of respondents meeting two or three of DSM-5 criteria B-E also had significantly elevated scores for most outcomes. The proportion of cases with threshold versus subthreshold PTSD varied depending on TE type, with threshold PTSD more common following interpersonal violence and subthreshold PTSD more common following events happening to loved ones. CONCLUSIONS: Subthreshold DSM-5 PTSD is most usefully defined as meeting two or three of DSM-5 criteria B-E. Use of a consistent definition is critical to advance understanding of the prevalence, predictors, and clinical significance of subthreshold PTSD.;Epidemiology | Nosology | Partial PTSD | Posttraumatic stress disorder | PTSD | Subthreshold PTSD;135;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;SAF 2000-158-CE;National Institutes of Health

Immersed in their own world view, this research will explain why the deaths of children resulting from the bite of a witch were backed by the civil authority, and conversely, the position of the Catholic priest in arguing the presence of childhood diseases, such as: epilepsy and fever. Thanks to the parents report of night attacks of the witch, the myth gains a fantasy, legendary and at the same time fearful sense. Alternatively, to prevent the witch attack protection rituals were performed. In order to feel confident, at the beginning of the night, parents placed a mirror in the child's bed and scissors behind the door of the house, a crucifix and a bucket of water. Regarding the physical traces of the dead two possibilities arise: one associated with a disease and the other with suffocation. In addition, the Tlaxcalteca legislation that allowed the registration of deaths related to mythical causes will be released.;Diseases | Health history | Witchcraft;0;0;;;;undefined;

We examined associations between a wide range of DSM-IV mental disorders with adult onset of asthma and whether observed associations remain after mental comorbidity adjustments. Methods: During face-to-face household surveys in community-dwelling adults (n=52,095) of 19 countries, the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview retrospectively assessed lifetime prevalence and age at onset of 16 DSM-IV mental disorders. Asthma was assessed by self-report of physician's diagnosis together with age of onset. Survival analyses estimated associations between first onset of mental disorders and subsequent adult onset asthma, without and with comorbidity adjustment. Results: 1860 adult onset (21 years+) asthma cases were identified, representing a total of 2,096,486 person-years of follow up. After adjustment for comorbid mental disorders several mental disorders were associated with subsequent adult asthma onset: bipolar (OR=1.8; 95%CI 1.3-2.5), panic (OR=1.4; 95%CI 1.0-2.0), generalized anxiety (OR=1.3; 95%CI 1.1-1.7), specific phobia (OR=1.3; 95%CI 1.1-1.6); post-traumatic stress (OR=1.5; 95%CI 1.1-1.9); binge eating (OR=1.8; 95%CI 1.2-2.9) and alcohol abuse (OR=1.5; 95%CI 1.1-2.0). Mental comorbidity linearly increased the association with adult asthma. The association with subsequent asthma was stronger for mental disorders with an early onset (before age 21). Conclusions: A wide range of temporally prior mental disorders are significantly associated with subsequent onset of asthma in adulthood. The extent to which asthma can be avoided or improved among those with early mental disorders deserves study.";Asthma | Chronic disease | Comorbidity | Epidemiology | Mental disorders | Population;46;0;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01MH069864;National Institute of Mental Health

We assessed the abundance and behaviour of frugivorous birds in early, intermediate and mature dry forests in the Balsas river basin, Guerrero, Mexico. We selected nine dry-forest fragments, three fragments per stage, in these three stages of succession. We analysed the vegetation, estimated bird abundances in 10-min count periods, and recorded the way birds process fruits in circular plots (11-15 plots per fragment, 123 plots in total). Birds were classified as seed predators (15% of all individuals in this study), pulp consumers (15%) or legitimate dispersers (70%). Bird abundance was higher in mature forests in the dry season, while abundance and richness of legitimate dispersers and seed predators were positively related to vegetation complexity. Mature forests have a high vegetation complexity and a high cover of Bursera species that produce fruit during the dry season. During the rains, abundance was higher in early-successional sites when the zoochorous plants produced fruit. Legitimate disperser migrants (i.e. Tyrannus vociferans, Myiarchus cinerascens and M. tyrannulus) were widespread, helping the establishment of zoochorous trees such as Bursera spp. in early-successional forests.;Bursera | disturbance | forest succession | migratory birds | tyrannids | zoochorous trees;1;0;;;;165552;

We have developed a novel concept for immunogen construction based on introduction of massive mutations within the epitopes targeting antigenically variable pathogens and diseases. Previously, we showed that these immunogens carrying large combinatorial libraries of mutated epitope variants, termed as variable epitope libraries (VELs), induce potent, broad and long lasting CD8+IFN-γ+ T-cell response as well as HIV-neutralizing antibodies. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested immunogenic properties and anti-tumor effects of the VELs bearing survivin-derived CTL epitope (GWEPDDNPI) variants in an aggressive metastatic mouse 4T1 breast tumor model. The constructed VELs had complexities of 10,500 and 8,000 individual members, generated as combinatorial M13 phage display and synthetic peptide libraries, respectively, with structural composition GWXPXDXPI, where X is any of 20 natural amino acids. Statistically significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in BALB/c mice immunized with the VELs in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Vaccinated mice developed epitope-specific spleen cell and CD8+ IFN-γ+ T-cell responses that recognize more than 50% of the panel of 87 mutated epitope variants, as demonstrated in T-cell proliferation assays and FACS analysis. These data indicate the feasibility of the application of this new class of immunogens based on VEL concept as an alternative approach for the development of molecular vaccines against cancer.;Antigenic variability | Cancer epitope vaccine | Peptide vaccine | Variable epitope library;12;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Thus, the purpose of this preliminary study was to determine the association of HLA class I alleles with AED-induced cADRs in MM patients. Materials & methods: This case-control association study included 21 MM patients with phenytoin (PHT)-, carbamazepine (CBZ)-, or lamotrigine (LTG)-induced maculopapular exanthema (MPE) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS); 31 MM patients tolerant to the same AEDs; and 225 unrelated, healthy MM volunteers. HLA class I genotyping was performed. Differences in HLA allele frequencies between AED-induced cADR patients and AED-tolerant patients were assessed. Frequencies of alleles possibly associated with AED-induced cADRs in MM patients were compared with those in MM population. Results: The frequency of HLA-C∗08:01 allele in PHT-induced MPE was higher than that in the PHT-tolerant group (pc = 0.0179) or in the MM population (pc < 0.0001). For the first time, HLA-A∗02:01:01/-B∗35:01:01/-C∗04:01:01 haplotype was associated with LTG-induced MPE (pc = 0.0048 for LTG-tolerant groups and pc < 0.0001 for MM population). Conclusion: Our data suggest the HLA-A∗02:01:01/-B∗35:01:01/-C∗04:01:01 haplotype may be a biomarker for LTG-induced MPE and the HLA-C∗08:01 allele for PHT-induced MPE. We also identified HLA-A∗01:01:01 and -A∗31:01:02 as candidates alleles associated with CBZ-induced MPE in MM patients. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm these findings.

It is distributed worldwide. Factors associated with virulence (such as hemolysins, enterotoxins, proteases, phospholipases, aerobactin, and hemagglutinin) have been identified; however, its pathogenicity mechanism is still unknown. In pathogenic Vibrio species such as V.cholerae, Vibrio. parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus, capsule, biofilms, lateral flagellum, and type IV pili are structures described as essential for pathogenicity. These structures had not been described in V.mimicus until this work. We used 20 V.mimicus strains isolated from water (6), oyster (9), and fish (5) samples and we were able to identify the capsule, biofilm, lateral flagellum, and type IV pili through phenotypic tests, electron microscopy, PCR, and sequencing. In all tested strains, we observed and identified the presence of capsular exopolysaccharide, biofilm formation in an invitro model, as well as swarming, multiple flagellation, and pili. In addition, we identified homologous genes to those described in other bacteria of the genus in which these structures have been found.

This method was based on pulse dynamic respirometry and involved the injection of several pulses of substrate and inhibitors, of increasing concentration. Furthermore, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of heavy metals (copper and zinc), substrate and biomass concentrations, and pH on activated sludge activity. While higher biomass concentrations counteracted the inhibitory effects of both copper and zinc, higher substrate concentrations predominantly augmented the inhibitory effect of copper but no significant change in inhibition by zinc was observed. pH had a clear but relatively small effect on inhibition, partially explained by thermodynamic speciation. We determined the key kinetic parameters; namely, the half saturation constant (KS) and the maximum oxygen uptake rate (OURmax). The results showed that higher heavy metal concentrations substantially decreased KS and OURmax suggesting that the inhibition was uncompetitive.";Activated sludge | Chemical speciation | Kinetic parameters | Micro-24 | pH;10;0;;;;undefined;

The phytoplankton community response to the addition of four treatments with different combinations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silica (Si) (+N-NH4+, +P-PO4−, +Si-SO3, and N:P16) showed that phytoplankton was N-limited as indicated by an increase in phytoplankton biomass (i.e., chlorophyll a) (range, 8–34 mg m−3) during the dry season in two consecutive years (2006 and 2007). Picophytoplankton abundance significantly increased in the +N treatment (145.46 103 cells L−1), while microphytoplankton reached a maximum abundance (68.38 103 cells L−1) in the N:P16 treatment. Phytoplankton composition changed from a community initially dominated by dinoflagellates (e.g., Prorocentrum spp.) to another dominated by diatoms (Thalassiosira and Nitzschia longissima) in the N:P16 treatment. The +N treatment significantly increased Synechococcus sp. growth rates (1.3 divisions per day) (picocyanobacteria). Biomarker pigments measured in the experimental microcosms confirmed observed changes in phytoplankton groups. Our results reveal that La Mancha lagoon is a N-limited coastal system during the dry season and provides evidence of the temporal species successional patterns and mechanisms regulating the phytoplankton community response to nutrient enrichment pulses in this already eutrophic coastal lagoon.;Coastal lagoon | La Mancha | Mexico | Microcosms | Phytoplankton | Veracruz;9;0;;;NSF;1237517;National Science Foundation

Dopamine has been implicated in sexual motivation, coital behavior and sexual reward, however, some experiments show that D2-like or non-specific dopaminergic antagonists are not capable of blocking the conditioned place preference induced by ejaculation; therefore, the role of dopamine on sexual reward has not been demonstrated, or has been frequently discarded. We show that a dose of SCH 23390 (a specific dopamine D1-like receptor antagonist), which does not modify locomotion, blocks the conditioned place preference induced by ejaculation and the conditioned place preference induced by SKF 38393 (D1-like agonist). Our results indicate that dopamine, across the D1-like receptors, is involved in the sexual reward induced by ejaculation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.";Conditioned place preference | D1-like receptor | Male sexual behavior | SCH 23390 | SKF 38393;10;0;;;UAM;14411150;Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana

Our results show that Penicillium chrysogenum AS-P-78 and dogR5 strains lack hexokinase, and suggest that an enzyme with glucokinase activity is involved in glucose regulation of penicillin biosynthesis and β-galactosidase, thus signaling glucose in both primary and secondary metabolism; however, catalytic and signaling activities seem to be independent.";Glucokinase | Glucose regulation | Penicillin | Penicillium chrysogenum;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Obesity and aging are known to be risk factors for metabolic disorder development, insulin resistance and inflammation, but their relationship is not fully understood. Prevention and appropriate therapies for metabolic disorders and physical disabilities in older adults have become a major public health challenge. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate inflammation markers, biochemical parameters and glucose homeostasis during the obese-aging process, to understand the relationship between obesity and health span during the lifetime. In order to do this, the monosodium glutamate (MSG) obesity mice model was used, and data were evaluated at 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 months in both female and male mice. Our results showed that obesity was a major factor contributing to premature alterations in MSG-treated mice metabolism; however, at older ages, obesity effects were attenuated and MSG-mice became more similar to normal mice. At a younger age (four months old), the Lee index, triglycerides, total cholesterol, TNF-α and transaminases levels increased; while adiponectin decreased and glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity levels were remarkably altered. However, from 16 months old-on, the Lee index and TNF-α levels diminished significantly, while adiponectin increased, and glucose and insulin homeostasis was recovered. In summary, MSG-treated obese mice showed metabolic changes and differential susceptibility by gender throughout life and during the aging process. Understanding metabolic differences between genders during the lifespan will allow the discovery of specific preventive treatment strategies for chronic diseases and functional decline. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.";Aging | Cytokines | Diabetes | Inflammation | Insulin resistance | Monosodium glutamate | Obesity;29;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are metabolized by a variety of enzymatic reactions, and the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family has attracted considerable attention. Some of the CYPs exist as genetic (allelic) variants, which may also affect the plasma concentrations or drug exposure. Regarding the metabolism of AEDs, the polymorphic CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are of particular interest. There have been recent advances in discovering factors such as these, especially those underlying the risk of medication toxicity. This review summarizes the evidence about whether such polymorphisms affect the clinical action of AEDs to facilitate future studies on the pharmacogenetics of epilepsy. We performed Key Words searches in the public databases PubMed, Medscape, and Rxlisty, Pharm GKB for genetic polymorphisms and the NCBI website for the nomenclature of alleles of CYP450, finding that CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2D19 were involved in the metabolism of most antiepileptic drugs, given the allele frequency in the population and the associated variability in the clinical response.;Alleles | Anticonvulsants | CYP450 genes | DNA polymorphism | Drug metabolism | Epilepsy | Pharmacogenetics | Review;26;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Methods: Data are from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey collected in 2005-2007, as part of the World Mental Health Survey Initiative. A latent class analysis of the 11 DSM-5-AUD criteria was performed using Mplus, taking into account complex survey design features. Weighted logistic regression models were used to examine demographic correlates of the DSM-5-AUD latent classes. Results: The best latent-class model was a three-class model. We found a ""non-symptomatic class"" (69.7%), a ""use in larger amounts class"" (23.2%), defined by high probability (>70%) of the ""use in larger amounts"" criterion only, and a ""high-moderate symptomatic class"" (7.1%), defined by high-moderate probability of all the 11 AUD criteria. Compared to those in the non-symptomatic class, individuals in the ""high-moderate symptomatic class"" were more likely to have been married, have lower educational attainment and to be unemployed or in non-regular/informal employment. Those on the ""use in larger amounts class"" were more likely to have been married or never married. Conclusion: The two symptomatic classes clearly represented the dimensionality of the new proposed AUD criteria, and could be more specifically targeted by different prevention or treatment strategies. DSM-5-AUD has the advantage of shedding light on risky drinkers included in the ""use in larger amounts class"", allowing for preventive interventions, which will reach a large number of individuals. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.";Alcohol use disorders (AUD) | Brazil | DSM-5 criteria | Latent class analysis | São Paulo;17;0;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;002/2003;National Institute of Mental Health

Previously, we have demonstrated that Silymarin recovers the normal morphology and endocrine function of damaged pancreatic tissue in alloxan induced diabetic rats. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of Silymarin in Pdx1 gene expression and its repercussion on insulin gene expression and β-cell proliferation. 72 Wistar rats were partially pancreatectomized (60%) and divided into 12 groups. Six groups were treated daily with Silymarin (200 mg/kg p.o.) for 3, 7, 14, 21, 42 and 63 day periods. Also, an unpancreatectomized control group was performed. At each time interval three animals from each group were administered BrdU 18 h before the sacrifice. Insulin and Pdx-1 gene expression were assessed by RT-PCR assay in total pancreatic RNA. β-Cell proliferation was determined by immunoperoxidase assay. In contrast to the animals that were only pancreatectomized, the Silymarin treatment induced an increase in both Pdx1 and insulin gene expression as well as β-cell proliferation in pancreatic tissue (control = 2.6 ± 0.28%; untreated = 14.25 ± 0.56%; treated = 39.08 ± 4.62%). Consequently, serum insulin levels rose (control = 1.01 ± 0.02 ng/ml; untreated = 1.18 ± 0.42 ng/ml; treated = 4.58 ± 0.58 ng/ml) and serum glucose levels decreased in these animals (control = 6.2 ± 0.01 mM; untreated = 9.02 ± 0.41 mM; treated = 6.41 ± 0.32 mM).

Heterologous IVF may be useful when assessing that of wild animals as it is often difficult to obtain adequate numbers of naturally corresponding oocytes. The aim of the present study was to assess the fertilization capacity of frozen-thawed ibex epididymal spermatozoa via heterologous IVF involving the oocytes of prepubertal domestic goats. The effect on fertilization and embryo development of adding oestrous sheep serum (ESS) to the fertilization medium was also examined. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were matured in TCM-199 for 24-27 h at 38.5°C in a 5% CO2 in air atmosphere. Frozen-thawed epididymal spermatozoa were selected by density gradient centrifugation. After maturation, the oocytes were co-incubated with spermatozoa in synthetic oviductal fluid (SOF) with different concentrations of ESS: SOF-C (0%), SOF-2 (2%) and SOF-20 (20%). At 17 h post-insemination (hpi), zygotes with one female and one male pronucleus (2PN) were categorised as normal; zygotes with 3PN were recorded as polyspermic, and oocytes with 1PN as asynchronous. Cleavage and blastocyst development were assessed at 48 and 168 hpi respectively. The percentage of zygotes with 2PN was higher in the SOF-2 than in the SOF-20 treatment group (27.7% versus 2.9% P < 0.05). The percentage of blastocysts formed with the SOF-C, SOF-2 and SOF-20 treatments were 1.1%, 7.5% and 0% respectively. These results show that the presence of 2% ESS achieves better results than the use of no serum or the standard 20% concentration.

Dysfunctions in the activity of the central nervous system's serotonergic function are important in understanding the pathophysiology of depression. The serotonin system is implicated in major depression and suicide and is negatively regulated by somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors is implicated in the long latency of some antidepressant treatments. Alterations in 5-HT1A receptor levels are reported in depression and suicide. In this study, we analyzed the effect of neonatal administration of CMI on the activity of 5-HT1A receptors, both pre- and post-synaptically, by administering an agonist of 5-HT1A receptors, 8-OH-DPAT, and then subjecting the rats to the forced swimming test (FST) a common procedure used to detect signs of depression in rats. Also measured were levels of the mRNA expression of 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe (DR), the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. Wistar rats were injected twice daily with CMI at doses of 15mgkg-1 or saline as vehicle (CON) via s.c. from postnatal day 8 for 14days. At 3-4months of age, one set of rats from each group (CON, CMI) was evaluated for the effect of a selective agonist to the 5-HT1A receptor subtype, 8-OH-DPAT, by testing in the FST. Also determined was the participation of the pre- or post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptor in the antidepressant-like action of 8-OH-DPAT. This involved administering an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA), and pretreatment with 8-OH-DPAT before the FST test and to evaluate the rectal temperature and locomotor activity. The expression of the mRNA of the 5-HT1A receptors was examined in the dorsal raphe nucleus, the hypothalamus and the hippocampus using the semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. The results from this study corroborate that neonatal treatment with clomipramine induces a pronounced immobility in the FST when animals reach adulthood, manifested by a significant decrease in swimming behavior, though counts of climbing behavior were not modified. This effect was similar in magnitude when 8-OH-DPAT was administered to CON group. Furthermore, the administration of 8-OH-DPAT induces a significant and similar increase in rectal temperature and locomotor activity in both the CON as in the CMI group. Neonatal treatment with CMI resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of the mRNA of the 5-HT1A receptors in the DR (% more than vehicle) in adulthood. In the case of the postsynaptic receptors located in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, neonatal treatment with CMI induced a significant increase in the mRNA expression of the 5-HT1A receptors. These data suggest that neonatal treatment with CMI induces a downregulation of the mRNA of the 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the DR, and an increment in the expression of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. The results after the administration of PCPA and 8-OH-DPAT on FST, rectal temperature and locomotor activity for both groups suggest that the function of postsynaptic receptors remains unchanged. All together these data show that the depressive behavior observed in adulthood in this animal model may be associated with long-term alterations in the expression of the mRNA of the 5-HT1A receptors. © 2013.;5-HT1A receptor | 8-OH-DPAT | Clomipramine | Depression | Forced swimming test | PCPA | RT-PCR;17;0;;;;undefined;

These characteristics can restrict gene flow and act upon the genetic divergence and speciation in arid plants. We conducted a phylogeographic study to determine if the origin, current distribution, and genetic structure of M. pectinifera were driven by Quaternary geomorphic processes. Sequences of the plastids psbA-trnH and trnT-trnL obtained from 66 individuals from seven populations were used to estimate genetic diversity. Population differentiation was assessed by an analysis of molecular variance. We applied a stepwise phylogenetic calibration test to determine whether species origin and genetic divergence among haplotypes were temporally concordant with recognizable episodes of geomorphic evolution. The combination of plastid markers yielded six haplotypes, with high levels of haplotype diversity (h = 0.622) and low nucleotide diversity (π = 0.00085). The populations were found to be genetically structured (FST = 0.682; P < 0.00001), indicating that geographic isolation and limited dispersal were the primary causes of genetic population differentiation. The estimated origin and divergence time among haplotypes were 0.017-2.39 and 0.019-1.237 mya, respectively, which correlates with Pleistocene tectonics and erosion events, supporting a hypothesis of geomorphically-driven geographical isolation.

Recent findings suggest a possible relationship between the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the vagal anti-inflammatory response during labor. Furthermore, the role of vaginal microbiota is particularly important during pregnancy because vaginal dismicrobism is one of the most important mechanisms associated with preterm birth. In this review, we present evidence suggesting that a sterile anti-inflammatory response is manifested to attenuate the excessive inflammation introduced by low-risk labor at term, involving either the action of a cholinergic pathway, uterine-like myokines or the vaginal microbiome.;Anti-inflammatory response | heart rate variability | labor | pregnancy | vaginal microbiota;11;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

From this perspective, the tools and models that have been developed to study this kind of systems have been applied. This is in order to create a distributed congestion control based on a set of simple rules programmed at the nodes of the WSN. Our results show that it is possible to adapt the carried traffic to the network capacity, even under stressing conditions. Also, the network performance shows a smooth degradation when the traffic goes beyond a threshold which is settled by the proposed self-organized control. In contrast, without any control, the network collapses before this threshold. The use of the proposed solution provides an effective strategy to address some of the common problems found in WSN deployment by providing a fair packet delivery. In addition, the network congestion is mitigated using adaptive traffic mechanisms based on a satisfaction parameter assessed by each packet which has impact on the global satisfaction of the traffic carried by the WSN.;;8;1;repositoryam;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We measured clinical, endoscopic, and tomographic variables for 1 year, at which time we performed histomorphological evaluations of the implant using light and electron microscopy. There were no adverse events throughout the clinical progression. On endoscopic evaluation, the implant was covered with mucosal tissue beginning in the first month, without granulation or stenosis, and the circular shape of the trachea was altered. Tomographic images of the tracheal area at the implant site were similar to adjacent healthy areas (p = 0.423). At the end of the follow-up period, the plaque had biodegraded, and the space was covered by pseudostratified epithelium and ciliated cells similar to the neighboring tissue. Implantation of a PLA/PGA plaque constituted an effective (functional) replacement of a short semicircular cervical tracheal segment without limiting the growth of the recipient.

The most important pharmacogenetic finding is related to the association of CBZ-induced hypersensitivity with human leukocyte antigens (HLA class I and II alleles).

Nevertheless, there is a challenge to study and calibrate the use of such indices for the practical structural evaluation of complex structures. In this paper, an energy-based damage model for multidegree-of-freedom (MDOF) steel framed structures that accounts explicitly for the effects of cumulative plastic deformation demands is used to estimate the cyclic drift capacity of steel structures. To achieve this, seismic hazard curves are used to discuss the limitations of the maximum interstory drift demand as a performance parameter to achieve adequate damage control. Then the concept of cyclic drift capacity, which incorporates information of the influence of cumulative plastic deformation demands, is introduced as an alternative for future applications of seismic design of structures subjected to long duration ground motions. © 2014 Edén Bojórquez et al.;;0;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Although several process and molecular approaches have been applied to prevent overflow metabolism, these approaches often result in reductions in growth rate, biomass yield or accumulation of other byproducts. In this report, we present an alternative approach based on increasing the efficiency of aerobic metabolism by the expression of the Vitreoscilla stercoraria hemoglobin (VHb) to avoid overflow metabolism. VHb is expected to increase the consumption of NADH in the respiratory chain, leading to increased activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This would result in a faster consumption of acetyl Co-A and a decrease in acetate production. When this strategy was tested in E. coli strains, acetate production decreased by 50% in MG1655 and more than 90% in W3110, without affecting growth rates or biomass yields. VHb expression in mutant strains with higher TCA activity and reduced acetate formation resulted in a significant increase in growth and glucose consumption rates, whereas acetate production did not increase. The results presented here show that enhancing the efficiency of aerobic metabolism is a valuable approach to avoid overflow metabolism in E. coli and to attain high cell densities in batch mode. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To characterize the mechanism by which this subunit inhibits the F1FO nanomotor, the ζ subunit of Paracoccus denitrificans (Pd-ζ) was analyzed by the combination of kinetic, biochemical, bioinformatic, proteomic, and structural approaches. The ζ subunit causes full inhibition of the sulfite-activated PdF1-ATPase with an apparent IC50 of 270 nM by a mechanism independent of the ε subunit. The inhibitory region of the ζ subunit resides in the first 14 N-terminal residues of the protein, which protrude from the 4-α-helix bundle structure of the isolated ζ subunit, as resolved by NMR. Cross-linking experiments show that the ζ subunit interacts with rotor (γ) and stator (α, β) subunits of the F1-ATPase, indicating that the ζ subunit hinders rotation of the central stalk. In addition, a putatively regulatory nucleotidebinding site was found in the ζ subunit by isothermal titration calorimetry. Together, the data show that the ζ subunit controls the rotation of F1FO-ATPase by a mechanism reminiscent of, but different from, those described for mitochondrial IF1 and bacterial ε subunits where the 4-α-helix bundle of ζ seems to work as an anchoring domain that orients the N-terminal inhibitory domain to hinder rotation of the central stalk. © FASEB.;Paracoccus denitrificans | Regulation;27;0;;;;undefined;

It is becoming increasingly clear that estradiol (E2) induces breast cancer cell progression and enhances EMT; however, the mechanisms associated with this are unclear. We investigated the role of E2 on the expression and intracellular localization of the tight junction (TJ)-associated proteins, zonula occluden 1 (ZO-1), ZO-1-associated nucleic acid binding (ZONAB), and occludin, on the activation of c-Src and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression and cellular migration in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D. We demonstrated that 1 nM E2 elicits c-Src activation after 15 min. The p-Src/ZO-1 complex led to ZO-1 and ZONAB disruption at the TJ and increased expression of HER2 mRNAs. These changes correlate with decreased expression of the epithelial markers occludin and CRB3 and increased synthesis of N-cadherin. This led to increased MCF-7 cell migration induced by E2, even in the presence of a cell proliferation inhibitor. Incubation with ICI 182,780 (Fulvestrant), an ER antagonist, precluded the effects of E2 on c-Src phosphorylation, p-Src/ZO-1 complex formation, ZO-1/ZONAB nuclear translocation, and migration of MCF-7 cells. Our findings suggest that E2 promotes TJ disruption during tumor progression and increases cell motility. We propose a novel pathway where estrogens promote EMT-associated mechanisms that possibly lead to metastasis. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.";;25;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

(32a) and Bacillus subtilis (52g). In solid medium, 22e and 32a precipitated calcite and vaterite while 52g produced calcite. Urease activity was detected in these isolates and CaCO3 precipitation increased in the presence of urea in the liquid medium. In the presence of calcium, EPS production decreased in 22e and 32a and increased in 52g. Under laboratory conditions, ignimbrite colonization by these isolates only occurred in the presence of calcium and no CaCO3 was precipitated. Calcium may therefore be important for biofilm formation on stones. The importance of the type of stone, here a siliceous stone, on biological colonization is emphasized. This calcium effect has not been reported on calcareous materials. The importance of the effect of calcium on EPS production and biofilm formation is discussed in relation to other applications of CaCO3 precipitation by bacteria. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.;biofilm formation | calcium effect | EPS production | heterotrophic bacteria | ignimbrite stones;40;0;;;;undefined;

Mice that were intermittently fasted for 12 weeks or fed ad libitum were infected with S. typhimurium and assessed at 7 and 14 days post-infection. Next, we evaluated bacterial load in the faeces, Peyer's patches, spleen and liver by plate counting, as well as total and specific intestinal IgA and plasmatic corticosterone levels (by immunoenzymatic assay) and lamina propria IgA levels in plasma cells (by cytofluorometry). Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, α- and J-chains, Pax-5 factor, pro-inflammatory cytokine (tumour necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (transforming growth factor-β) mRNA levels were assessed in mucosal and liver samples (by real-time PCR). Compared with the infected ad libitum mice, the intermittently fasted infected animals had (1) lower intestinal and systemic bacterial loads; (2) higher SIgA and IgA plasma cell levels; (3) higher mRNA expression of most intestinal parameters; and (4) increased or decreased corticosterone levels on day 7 and 14 post-infection, respectively. No contribution of liver IgA was observed at the intestinal level. Apparently, the changes following metabolic stress induced by intermittent fasting during food deprivation days increased the resistance to S. typhimurium infection by triggering intestinal IgA production and presumably, pathogen elimination by phagocytic inflammatory cells. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.";;8;0;;;;undefined;

Here, we report the prevalence of sequence and structural mutations in these three main recessive genes in Mexican Mestizo patients. The complete sequences of these three genes were analyzed by homo/heteroduplex DNA formation and direct sequencing; exon dosage was determined by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and real-time PCR in 127 patients belonging to 122 families and 120 healthy Mexican Mestizo controls. All individuals had been previously screened for the three most common LRRK2 mutations. The presence of two mutations in compound heterozygous or homozygous genotypes was found in 16 unrelated patients, 10 had mutations in PARK2, six in PINK1, and none in DJ-1. Two PARK2-PINK1 and one PARK2-LRRK2 digenic cases were observed. Novel mutations were identified in PARK2 and PINK1 genes, including PINK1 duplication for the first time. Exon dosage deletions were the most frequent mutations in PARK2 (mainly in exons 9 and 12), followed by those in PINK1. The high prevalence of heterozygous mutations in PARK2 (12.3%) and the novel heterozygous and homozygous point mutations in PINK1 observed in familial and sporadic cases from various states of Mexico support the concept that single heterozygous mutations in recessive Parkinson's disease genes play a pathogenic role. These data have important implications for genetic counseling of Mexican Mestizo patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease. The presence of digenic inheritance underscores the importance of studying several genes in this disease. A step-ordered strategy for molecular diagnosis is proposed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.";Digenic inheritance | DJ-1 | Early-onset Parkinson's disease | PARK2 | PINK1;9;0;;;;undefined;

Yet the role that alcoholic beverage preferences and the drinking context play in the risk for injury is still under-investigated. In this study, a cross-national comparison of the association between alcohol and injury focusing on beverage type preference and the drinking context is reported. Methods: Emergency department (ED) injured patients were interviewed in eight countries from the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region. Data on the type of alcoholic beverage, total alcohol volume, and the place where the injury occurred were obtained from patients who reported any alcohol consumption within 6. h prior to being injured. Patients who did not drink prior to injury were also asked about their typical drinking pattern and the injury place. Differences within- and between-groups were evaluated regarding patients' typical drinking and drinking before injury. Results: Beer was the most prevalent beverage type usually consumed among injured patients across countries, however, patients who drank before injury had a higher typical consumption of spirits than those not drinking prior to injury. The total alcohol volume typically consumed and drinking in public settings were also found to be positively associated with alcohol-related injury. Conclusions: A similar beverage-specific association with alcohol-related injury was found across LAC countries, mainly attributed to beer consumption, and spirits drinkers seem to have a greater chance of becoming involved in injury events. Future prevention strategies should inform the public about harms from drinking associated with the context in which drinking takes place. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;Alcoholic beverage | Drinking | Emergency department | Injuries | Latin America;12;0;repositoryam;Green;NIAAA;P50AA005595;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism

Treated birds had a reduction in BWL of 37 g in experiment 1 and 32.2 g in experiment 2. In experiment 2, no differences were observed in carcass yield between groups. Estimation of the cost benefit suggested a 1:16 ratio by using the OA. In experiment 3, conducted in Mexico, significant differences on water consumption, BWL, and meat quality characteristics were observed in chickens that were treated with the OA (P < 0.05).

Several studies have described the main physical processes and induced surface patterns using 1D and 3D modelling, as well as in situ measurements. Previous models were applied at the mesoscale without taking into account the lagoon. Using a recently developed 3D coupled physical-biogeochemical model that considers the complex ocean-lagoon interface, we aim to understand better the impact of the upwelling on the lagoon. The model was found to be in good agreement with measured data reported in previous publications about two upwelling events. However, in general, levels of surface chlorophyll- a were overestimated by the model in the upwelling area when compared to ocean colour data and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the discrepancy. We then tracked rich upwelled water using a forward Lagrangian transport analysis. Upwelled waters from the upper nutricline were found to be able to reach the South West lagoon. An anti-cyclonic eddy was detected near the upwelling area, potentially responsible, in part, for the rich water intrusions into the lagoon. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;3D coupled physical-biogeochemical model | Lagrangian transport | New Caledonia | Ocean-lagoon cross-shore processes | Wind-driven coastal upwelling;13;0;;;ANRT;undefined;Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie

Extracts from the aerial part of the species were obtained by direct maceration using hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol. Phytochemical and pharmacologic studies were carried out afterwards. These studies found that the species have different pharmacological and chemical patterns in the studied experimental models and therefore, determined that they might possess different medical properties, thus explaining the wide variety of therapeutic qualities that had been attributed to the Mora herb.

In this study, the antioxidant properties of coffee pulp extracts, after FAE using several bacteria in a solid-state lactic fermentation were evaluated by ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging assays. Released bioactive compounds were identified by HPLC-MS. Lactobacillus casei enhanced the antioxidant capacity of coffee pulp extracts due to release of high amounts of phenolics like chlorogenic acid and resorcinol.;Antioxidants | Coffee pulp | Extraction | Fermentation | Lactic bacteria;4;0;;;;undefined;

Photoluminescence study of porous SiC:N (PSiC) layers with different PSiC thicknesses reveals the intensity stimulation for the high energy PL bands. The early investigation of temperature dependences of the high energy PL bands had shown that these PL bands related to free exciton emission in the different SiC polytypes. The SiC polytypes in the original n-type SiC:N wafers and in porous SiC layers were confirmed by XRD study. The intensity enhancement of exciton-related PL bands in big size (50-250nm) SiC NCs is attributed to the realization of the exciton week confinement and exciton-light coupling in SiC NCs. The numerical simulation of exciton radiative recombination rates for the different exciton emissions has been done using a model of exciton-light coupling in SiC NCs. The experimental and numerically calculated results have been compared and discussed.;luminescence | nanostructure | porosity;0;0;;;;undefined;

We investigated the C content in organic soil and in active fraction pools (organic matter and microbial biomass) and analyzed the dependence of these pools on precipitation. Carbon (total, inorganic and organic, and in microbial biomass) and N (total) concentrations in bulk soil decreased as rainfall increased from <600 mm year-1 >1,000 mm year-1. Additionally, in all organic matter fractions, C and N concentrations generally decreased with greater precipitation. Soil average C mineralization decreased by 61 % from the wettest to the driest region. Reduced precipitation during the dry season increased microbial biomass C and water-extractable C concentrations and decreased the C concentration in organic matter fractions. No other significant changes were observed between seasons in C concentrations, N concentrations or C mineralization. Overall, we conclude that physical (macroclimate) and biological processes are more active in soils in the wettest region, resulting in a faster turnover of organic matter. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;Carbon sequestration | Climate change | Drought | Fast carbon pools | Karstic soils;18;0;;;CONACYT;220610;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It requires the coordinated production of rRNA, ribosomal proteins and non-ribosomal factors which participate in the processing and mobilization of the new ribosomes. Ribosome biogenesis has been studied in yeast and animals; however, there is little information about this process in plants. The objective of the present work was to study ribosome biogenesis in maize seeds during germination, a stage characterized for its fast growth, and the effect of insulin in this process. Insulin has been reported to accelerate germination and to induce seedling growth. It was observed that among the first events reactivated just after 3 h of imbibition are the rDNA transcription and the pre-rRNA processing and that insulin stimulates both of them (40-230%). The transcript of nucleolin, a protein which regulates rDNA transcription and pre-rRNA processing, is among the messages stored in quiescent dry seeds and it is mobilized into the polysomal fraction during the first hours of imbibition (6 h). In contrast, de novo ribosomal protein synthesis was low during the first hours of imbibition (3 and 6 h) increasing by 60 times in later stages (24 h). Insulin increased this synthesis (75%) at 24 h of imbibition; however, not all ribosomal proteins were similarly regulated. In this regard, an increase in RPS6 and RPL7 protein levels was observed, whereas RPL3 protein levels did not change even though its transcription was induced. Results show that ribosome biogenesis in the first stages of imbibition is carried out with newly synthesized rRNA and ribosomal proteins translated from stored mRNA. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The intra-striatal administration of D1R agonists reduces DA release whereas D1R antagonists have the opposite effect. In this work, a microdialysis method was used to study the effect of co-activating D1 and H3 receptors on the release of DA from the rat dorsal striatum. Infusion of the D1R agonist SKF-38393 (0.5 and 1μM) significantly reduced DA release (26-58%), and this effect was prevented by co-administration of the H3R agonist immepip (10μM). In turn, the effect of immepip was blocked by the H3R antagonist thioperamide (10μM). Our results indicate that co-stimulation of post-synaptic D1 and H3 receptors may indirectly regulate basal DA release in the rat striatum and provide in vivo evidence for a functional interaction between D1 and H3 receptors in the basal ganglia. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;D  receptor 1 | Dopamine | Dopamine release | H  receptor 3 | Histamine | Striatum;18;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Lago de Guadalupe was hypereutrophic with anoxic conditions throughout most of the water column. In contrast, Lago el Llano was mesotrophic with high dissolved oxygen concentrations throughout the entire water column with a clinograde profile. Both reservoirs had a monomictic mixing regime. The longitudinal zonation of physicochemical and biological variables were investigated in order to better understand the processes controlling the water quality across the reservoir during its residence time.

In complementary DNA of DHH, we performed site-directed mutagenesis, which was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein extracts were obtained from HEK293cells transfected with different constructs and analyzed by Western blot; besides, densitometric analysis of chemiluminescent signals was performed. In addition, the structure of the wt-DHH and its two mutant proteins was inferred using in silico protein molecular modeling. In the Western blot analysis, we observed the absence of signal for p.L162P in DHH-N and a diminished signal for Δ1086delG in DHH-C, when compared to wt-DHH. Protein modeling showed notable conformational changes for the side chains of p.L162P, while the secondary structure was drastically modified in Δ1086delG, when compared to wt-DHH.

The nitrifying reactor achieved 100% of ammonia oxidation into nitrate. The effluent from this unit was fed to the autotrophic denitrifying reactor which treated a maximum sulphide loading rate (SLR) of 200 mg S2-/Ld with removal percentages of 100% and 30% for sulphide and nitrate, respectively. The low nitrate removal efficiency is attributed to sulphide limitations. The operational costs of this system were estimated as 0.92 €/kg Nremoved, lower than those for conventional nitrification/denitrification processes. For nitrogen removal the SHARON/anammox processes is the cheapest option.

In normal anesthetized dog and sheep, a focal magnetic field was directed toward the facial nerve within the temporal bone by placing a 6.5 cm figure-8 stimulation coil over the ear. In an initial set of experiments, CBF was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry and the cerebral vasculature was visualized by angiography. The effect of facial nerve stimulation was found to be dependent on stimulation power, frequency, and the precise positioning of the stimulation coil. Furthermore, an increase in CBF was not observed after direct electrical stimulation in the middle ear space, indicating that non-specific stimulation of the tympanic plexus, an intervening neural structure with vasoactive effects, was not responsible for the increase in CBF after pulsed magnetic stimulation. Subsequent experiments using perfusion MRI demonstrated reproducible increases in CBF throughout the forebrain that manifested bilaterally, albeit with an ipsilateral predominance. These experiments support the development of a non-invasive pulsed magnetic facial nerve stimulator that will increase CBF as a treatment of ischemic stroke. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;Cerebral blood flow | Facial nerve | Magnetic stimulation;13;0;;;;undefined;Henrietta B. and Frederick H.

XRD analysis shows that the support oxides chiefly contain tetragonal zirconia together with WO3 phase on surface. With Raman spectroscopy, the surface structure of WO3 (800 cm-1 for W-0 bond, 268 cm-1 for W-O-W bonds, and 711 cm-1 for W=0 bond) are observed. In situ FTIR spectra confirm that both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites are present in the catalysts. In the hydroisomerization of n-heptane, the highest n-heptane conversion (60.8%) is obtained over 1 wt% Pd/WO3-ZrO2 with 25 wt% WO3 at 300 °C and the isomerization selectivity reaches 90%.

Genetic polymorphisms of these enzymes have a key role in this variability. However, environmental factors, endogenous metabolism and disease states also have a great influence on the actual drug metabolism rate (metabolic phenotype). Consequently, the genotype does not always correlate with the actual drug hydroxylation phenotype. In this sense, in vivo phenotyping strategies represent an alternative to evaluate the interindividual variability in drug metabolism. Therefore, the 'cocktail' approach is considered as an advantageous strategy to obtain actual and reliable information on several CYP activities in just one experiment. As reviewed, phenotyping studies on Latin-American populations, which comprise about 400 million people, are scarce, and only selective phenotyping methods were applied. Therefore, a novel cocktail approach is here proposed as a phenotyping tool to evaluate the relationship between genotype and phenotype of major CYP enzymes in Hispanic populations. This determination will allow adaptation of drug therapies to these populations and consequently to benefit from the application of pharmacogenetics in the reduction of drug adverse effects and in the improvement of therapeutic responses.;Cocktail | Cytochrome P450 (CYP) | Genotype | Hispanics | Phenotype;14;0;;;;undefined;

The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of two strains to invade two endothelial cell types. Tachyzoites of the RH and ME49 strains were expanded in Balb/c and C57BL6-RAG2-/- mice, respectively. Tachyzoites were harvested from 72 h Vero cell cultures and incubated for 30 min to 4 h at 10:1 parasite/cell ratio in 24-well plates, containing monolayers of either HMEC-1 line or human umbilical cells (HUVECs). The number of infected cells and parasitic vacuoles per infected cell were counted in Wright stained slides. A slow increase in the proportion of infected cells occurred but varied according to cell type-parasite strain combination: ME49 tachyzoites invaded up to 63 % HMEC-1 cells, while RH parasites infected up to 19 % HUVECs. ME49 and RH tachyzoites invaded 49 and 46 % HUVECs and HMEC-1 cells, respectively. Reinvasion and formation of new parasitophorous vacuoles of infected cells was more frequent than invasion of noninfected cells. The results support that the factors influencing invasion, and thus dissemination and vertical transmission, are parasite type, host cell type/subtype, and activation state. Interestingly, T. gondii virulence does not seem to relay on its invasion efficiency, but probably on replication speed.

A clinical and epidemiological questionnaire and body mass index were used to assess the risk factors associated with human toxocariasis in 108 children with an age range of 2-16 years. Antibodies against Toxocara canis were detected using an ELISA test kit. Chi-square analysis and odds ratio (OR) were used to identify risk factors associated with Toxocara canis seropositivity. The prevalence of antibodies against Toxocara canis was greater (P=0.02) in males than females (28.84% and 16.07%, resp.). Chi-square analysis and odds ratio revealed just one variable with P<0.05, and OR>1.0 was associated with seropositivity: the possession of dogs under one year old (OR=1.78). Although not significant, the OR values suggest that other factors may be epidemiologically important for Toxocara presence such as not washing hands before meals, malnutrition, obesity, and use of public parks. Children in the age group >12 and <16 years old had higher seroprevalence to Toxocara canis (17.59%) than the >2 and <11 years old age group (4.62%).

Environmental O 3 exposure is associated with many symptoms related to respiratory disorders, which include loss of lung function, exacerbation of asthma, airway damage, and lung inflammation. The effects of O 3 are not restricted to the respiratory system or function - adverse effects within the central nervous system (CNS) such as decreased cognitive response, decrease in motor activity, headaches, disturbances in the sleepwake cycle, neuronal dysfunctions, cell degeneration, and neurochemical alterations have also been described; furthermore, it has also been proposed that O 3 could have epigenetic effects. O 3 exposure induces the reactive chemical species in the lungs, but the short half-life of these chemical species has led some authors to attribute the injurious mechanisms observed within the lungs to inflammatory processes. However, the damage to the CNS induced by O 3 exposure is not well understood. In this review, the basic mechanisms of inflammation and activation of the immune system by O 3 exposure are described and the potential mechanisms of damage, which include neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and the signs and symptoms of disturbances within the CNS caused by environmental O 3 exposure are discussed.";Air pollution | Central nervous system | Inflammation | Oxidative stress | Ozone;51;0;;;;undefined;

The evaluated techniques included the walking line transect and the driving line transect under two vegetation types and relative to season. The true population value (control) used to evaluate the techniques was a complete census using flights conducted over the entire study area (8000 ha). On grassland vegetation, the walking transect overestimates pronghorn density (n/km2), compared with the control (0.77 vs. 0.18 n/km2), as well as in the mesquite-grassland vegetation where the walking transect overestimates density (0.26 n/km2) compared with the control (0.11 n/km2). An increase in overestimation was found in the walking technique as the number of pronghorns in an area increased. In contrast, the driving technique showed no significant differences (P>0.05) compared with the control, in both grassland and mesquite-grassland pastures. It can be concluded that driving transect sampling is an accurate method to study pronghorn densities in the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem, while walking transect sampling estimations need to be adjusted to obtain accurate population sizes. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;accuracy | Antilocapra americana | line transect | population density | pronghorn;2;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The ambient temperature ranged from 28 to 35°C with a relative humidity of 60 to 95%. Treatments consisted of the addition of different percentages of lysine to the feed (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3%, dry matter [DM] base). There was a linear response (P < 0.01) in daily gain (68, 112, 118, and 151 mg/d) and daily intake (251, 289, 297, and 337 mg/d) for levels from 0 to 0.3%, respectively, as well in the growth in head size, snout-vent length, and total length.

Sausages with TNF + WO had a higher moisture content than the control (hence lower weight loss), lower pH values, higher water activity, similar L* values and higher a* and b* values than the control. The only microorganisms that were affected by the formula were mould and yeasts, but in all cases the counts at the end of ripening were comparable to the results of the most studies on fermented sausages. The increase in lipid oxidation in sausages due to the addition of WO was controlled by the TNF, probably due to the antioxidant compounds (phenolics) it contains. The samples with 1% TNF + 2. 5% WO and 2% TNF + 5% WO scored the same in terms of overall liking as the control. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.";Dietary fibre | Dry-cured sausage | Tiger nut | Unsaturated fatty acids | Walnut oil;28;0;;;;110AC0386;

Meat samples were stored for 14 days at 2±1 °C. The samples were divided into two sections: one was analyzed raw and the other was grilled to 72±2 °C prior to analysis. The data were examined using multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis). RESULTS: Tenderness showed a positive relationship with pH (0.55), and brightness presented a high correlation with sarcoplasmic protein solubility (-0.83) and L* (0.85) in raw ovine meat. Variations during storage were observed; for instance, textural parameters had a maximum value on the third day of storage for raw and grilled meat and decreased over the following days. Conversely, days 7 and 14 were distinguished by higher L* and b* values and by a greasy and bloody odor in the raw ovine meat. On day 14, grilled meat was characterized by chewiness on TPA, an intense grilled-meat odor and intense flavor, which had a positive relationship with cytochrome c equivalents (0.89). Likewise, sensory hardness was highly correlated with WBSF in grilled meat (0.89). CONCLUSION: This information may be useful for describing and predicting ovine meat quality for both consumers and processors. Therefore, vacuum-packaged ovine meat can be stored for 14 days without disagreeable color to the consumer, and the raw meat texture is tender. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry.";Meat color | Meat peptides | Raw and grilled ovine meat | Sensory analysis;12;0;;;;undefined;

Under controlled conditions, weak, temporary effects (10 %) on maize seedling growth were observed on poor soils (taken from the 10-20 cm layer) in the first 2 weeks after application. Positive effects of pruning residue applications on soil K levels (0. 09 cmol kg-1, on average) were detected in both the field and greenhouse study. However, significant effects due to the addition of microbial inocula on soil K concentrations were not detected in the field; thus, microbial applications were ineffective at enhancing nutrient availability under field conditions. In contrast, in the in vitro experiments, CO2 production was 31 % greater than that of untreated soil on the 8th and 15th days of incubation. These results highlight the importance of adding tree pruning residues to support coffee-plant nutrition.

The mechanisms that co-ordinate cell growth and division in maize embryonic axes during germination are not well understood. However, the presence of a factor similar to IGF (insulin-like growth factor) that accelerates germination has been reported. In the present work, the regulation of the cell-cycle restart by bovine insulin [which has been demonstrated to produce similar effects as insulin-like growth factor of maize (ZmIGF) in maize seeds] was studied in germinating embryonic axes. Our results showed that bovine insulin differentially stimulates growth, S6K phosphorylation, S6rp transcript accumulation on the polysomal fraction, as well as de novo DNA synthesis in the radicles and the coleoptiles of the embryonic axis. A stronger and earlier effect was observed in radicles compared to coleoptiles; therefore, the effect of insulin on the cell cycle of the root meristem was studied by flow cytometry. The G1-S transition was stimulated and cell proliferation was induced. Furthermore, it was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) that bovine insulin increased E2F and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) transcription after 15 h of germination and PCNA de novo synthesis at 15 h of germination. These results show that bovine insulin preferentially stimulates growth in the radicles of germinating embryonic axes and suggest that its effect on the G1-S transition and the activation of cell proliferation is mediated by the induction of E2F and PCNA transcription. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.";E2F transcription factor | insulin-like growth factor in Zea mays (ZmIGF) | proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) | Zea mays;5;0;;;;undefined;

Although an importance factor of 1.5 may promote adequate performance of essential facilities built in firm soil; the value of this factor for structures built in soft soil exhibits significant dependence with respect to the dynamic characteristics of the structural system. Because of this, the current use given to the importance factor may result in conservative or unsafe design of essential facilities built in soft soils. One way to improve the seismic design of essential facilities is to formulate displacement-based approaches. Within this context, a displacement-based methodology should aim at controlling simultaneously the level of structural and non-structural damage by limiting the plastic rotation and inter-story drift demands in the structural system of the essential facility. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.";Displacement-based design | Essential facilities | Immediate occupancy | Importance factor | Soft soil;2;0;;;;undefined;

Cross-national population epidemiologic surveys were analyzed to evaluate generalizability of the subtype in more diverse samples. Methods: Interviews were administered to 25,018 respondents in 16 countries in the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess 12-month DSM-IV PTSD and other common DSM-IV disorders. Items from a checklist of past-month nonspecific psychological distress were used to assess dissociative symptoms of depersonalization and derealization. Differences between PTSD with and without these dissociative symptoms were examined across a variety of domains, including index trauma characteristics, prior trauma history, childhood adversity, sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, functional impairment, and treatment seeking. Results: Dissociative symptoms were present in 14.4% of respondents with 12-month DSM-IV/Composite International Diagnostic Interview PTSD and did not differ between high and low/middle income countries. Symptoms of dissociation in PTSD were associated with high counts of re-experiencing symptoms and net of these symptom counts with male sex, childhood onset of PTSD, high exposure to prior (to the onset of PTSD) traumatic events and childhood adversities, prior histories of separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia, severe role impairment, and suicidality. Conclusion: These results provide community epidemiologic data documenting the value of the dissociative subtype in distinguishing a meaningful proportion of severe and impairing cases of PTSD that have distinct correlates across a diverse set of countries. © 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.;Dissociation | dissociative subtype | DSM-5 | epidemiology | nosology | posttraumatic stress disorder | World Mental Health Surveys;206;0;repositoryam;Green;NIH;4280;National Institutes of Health

Methods: Ninety-four patients receiving antituberculosis therapy participated in this prospective study. Plasma concentration-time data were described using a one-compartment model with lag time, absorption and first-order elimination. The potential influence of demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, and the pharmaceutical formulation (A, B, C and D) on the pharmacokinetics parameters, was evaluated by non-linear mixed-effect modelling (nonmem). Seventy-seven additional patients participated in the validation of the model. Results and Discussion: The final population pharmacokinetic model obtained was as follows: apparent clearance CL/F = 8·17 L/h (1·40 as high for males), apparent distribution volume Vd/F = 50·1 L (1·29 as high for males), absorption rate constant KaA= 0·391/h, KaB,C,D= 2·70/h, relative bioavailability FA= 0·468, FB,C,D= 1, lag time in the absorption phase Tlag= 0·264 h. The final model improved the precision on the parameter estimates (CL/F, Vd/F and Ka by 31·9%, 16·7% and 92·9%, respectively). The residual variability was 27·3%. What is new and Conclusion: Gender was associated with changes in CL/F and Vd/F whereas the pharmaceutical formulation was associated with changes in F and altered the Ka. The validation data set showed that the model could be used in clinical practice for Bayesian dose adjustment of RIF in TB patients. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;antituberculosis drug | non-linear mixed-effect modelling | NONMEM | population pharmacokinetics | rifampicin;21;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

To estimate the tolerance to water stress of five Mimosa species, some wood anatomical characteristics of vessel elements were compared and the wood mesomorphy and vulnerability ratios calculated. Three plants per species were studied and transverse sections and macerations were prepared from the stem. The mesomorphy and vulnerability ratios were estimated considering vessel diameter, vessels/mm2, and vessel element length. The five species showed numerous vessels (17 - 32) and short vessel elements (150 - 221 µm) with small diameters (58 - 75 µm), except M. tenuiflora, with medium sized diameter (104 µm). In the studied species, the mesomorphy ratio &gt; 200 matchs up to a mesomorphic wood and the vulnerability ratio &gt; 1 suggests a low resistant to water stress. The highest vulnerability ratio value corresponds to M. tenuiflora (6.26) and the lowest to M. leucaenoides (1.81). The results generated in this study are important to select plant species for ecological restoration purposes.";;9;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

Lung cancer is classifi ed into two large histologic subgroups: small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) according to cellular origin, molecular changes, clinical-pathological features, and response to treatments. NSCLC constitutes 80% of the all cases of lung cancer; nevertheless the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumoral etiology still remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by repressing translation or decreasing mRNA stability in numerous biological processes. In cancer, miRNAs have differential spatial and temporal expression, which is related to several clinical, biological, molecular and genomic features of tumors. miRNA expression profi les, polymorphisms and epigenetic modifi cation inNSCLC have been studied, and these studies have improved NSCLC diagnosis and classifi cation, as well as provided prognostic information. In this review, we describe some of the better-characterized miRNAs in NSCLC and how they could improve lung cancer prognosis and therapy. We summarize the current understanding in expression of miRNAs and their involvement in process biology of NSCLC, as well as their potential as biomarkers for risk stratifi cation, outcome prediction and classifi cation of histologic subtypes, in addition to circulating biomarkers and miRNA-based NSCLC therapy.";;2;0;;;;undefined;

Up to 95 samples of zooplankton were collected during August 1995 at 28 stations arranged in five transects on the continental shelf off the main lagoonal systems in the southern Gulf of Mexico, from the Coatzacoalcos River inlet to Paso Real inlet of Términos lagoon . Samples were collected at five depth ranges. Three of the identified taxa constituted 90% of the total pteropod abundance: Creseis acicula f. acicula (72.7%), C. acicula f clava (8.2%), and Limacina trochiformis (9.3%). The highest density of the group occurred within the first 18 m, but 19 of the 39 groups registered were absent from the surface layer (0-6 m), and others had low densities. The results of a CCA suggest that not one parameter by itself determines the distribution of these organisms in the water column, but the habitat of the species does. Species with tropical/subtropical and coastal affinities were the most abundant and occurred mainly in the surface layer, while the oceanic forms were less abundant and occurred mainly in the deep layers probably resulting from the inflow of oceanic water toward the shelf at its deepest layers.;Distribution | Pteropods | Southern gulf of Mexico;1;0;;;;undefined;

Rabbits supplemented with inulin had lower values of triglycerides compared with the control and AGP groups, and their glucose level was significantly lower than those treated with AGP. Additionally, serum calcium and magnesium concentrations were higher than the other groups, particularly with regard to AGP. The bone content with regard to calcium, phosphorus and magnesium in the groups treated with inulin was higher compared with the control; moreover, phosphorus and magnesium were higher than in the AGP group. The thickness of the mucosa and crypt depth in the caecum were significantly higher in rabbits treated with inulin than in the other groups, but especially compared with the AGP group. Also, triglyceride values were lower for rabbits treated with inulin/AGP than for those treated with AGP and the bone magnesium concentration was significantly higher compared with the control group. In addition, inulin was shown to have positive effects on the rabbit, promoting increase in bone and serum calcium, magnesium and phosphorus, decrease in triglyceride levels, and improvement in the caecum (changes in morphology, crypt depth and mucosal thickness). © 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.";Bone | Caecal | Crypts | Diet | Inulin | Minerals | Mucosa;4;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

In our previous work, (González-Díaz, H., et al. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003, 16, 1318-1327), we introduced the molecular structure information indices called 3D-Markovian electronic delocalization entropies (3D-MEDNEs) to study the quantitative structure-toxicity relationships (QSTR) of drugs. In a second part, (Cruz-Monteagudo, M. et al. Chem. Res. Toxicol., 2008, 21 (3), 619-632), we extended 3D-MEDNEs to numerically encode toxicologically-relevant information present in Mass Spectra of the serum proteome. These works demonstrated that the idea behind classic drug QSTR models can be extended to solve more general problems in toxicological chemical research. For instance, there are not many reports of multi-target QSTR (mt-QSTR) models useful to predict multiplexed endpoints of drugs in a high number of cytotoxicity assays. In this work, we train and validate for the first time a QSTR model that correctly classifies 8,806 out of 9,001 (Accuracy = 91.1%) multiplexing assay endpoints of 7903 drugs (including both training and validation series). Each endpoint corresponds to one out of 1443 assays, 32 molecular and cellular targets, 46 standard type measures, in two possible organisms (human and mouse). We have also determined experimentally, for the first time, the values of EC50 = 8.21 μg/mL and Cytotoxicity = 26.25 % for the antimicrobial / antiparasitic drug G1 on Balb/C mouse thymic macrophages using flow cytometry. In addition, we have used the new model to predict G1 endpoints in 1,283 assays finding a low average probability of p(1) = 0.50% in 152 cytotoxicity assays. Last, we have used the model to predict average probability of the interaction of G1 with different proteins in macrophages. Interestingly, the Macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, the Macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, the Macrophage migration inhibitory factor, Macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II, and the Macrophage-stimulating protein receptor, have also very low average predicted probabilities of p(1) = 0.092, 0.038, 0.077, 0.026, 0.2, 0.106, respectively. Both experimental and theoretical results show a moderate thymic macrophage cytotoxicity of G1. The obtained results are significant because they complement the immunotoxicology studies of this important drug. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.;Drug immunotoxicity and cytotoxicity | Entropy | Flow cytometry | Multi-target models;40;0;;;;undefined;

In experiment 1, raw chicken skin samples were dipped into a suspension of either 108 cfu/mL of Salmonella Typhimurium, Esch-erichia coli O157:H7, or Listeria monocytogenes for 30 s and then immersed in PBS or an OA wash solution mixture of 0.8% citric, 0.8% acetic, and 0.8% propionic acid (at equal wt/vol concentrations) for an additional 30 s. In experiment 2, three different concentrations of the OA wash solution (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6% at equal wt/vol concentrations) were tested against chicken skin samples contaminated with Salmonella Typhimurium Viable pathogenic bacteria on each skin sample were enumerated after 1 and 24 h of storage at 4°C in both experiments. In experiment 3, skin samples were initially treated on d 1 with PBS or 2 concentrations of the OA mixture (0.4 and 0.8%), and total aerobic bacteria were enumerated during a 2-wk storage period. In all experiments, significant (P < 0.05) differences were observed when skin samples were treated with the OA wash solution and no spoilage organisms were recovered at any given time point, whereas increasing log10 numbers of spoilage organisms were recovered over time in PBS-treated skin samples. These results suggest that 0.2 to 0.8% concentrations of an equal-percentage mixture of this OA combination may reduce pathogens and spoilage organisms and improve food safety properties of raw poultry. © 2013 Poultry Science Association Inc.;Chicken | Foodbornepathogen | Organic acid | Shelf-life | Skin rinse;12;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

With the information obtained from the site amplification functions and available geotechnical soundings we develop an empirical model to estimate the future value of Ts for several sites in Mexico City.

Metal concentrations in plant and bioconcentration factors (BCF) were also determined. Organic matter (OM) and total N contents were higher in the rhizospheric samples, which could improve the conditions for plant establishment. Total Cu, Zn, and Pb concentration were above those for normal soils. The highest metals concentration was found in the residual and organic fractions. Eleven plant species were recorded at the site; three behaved as metal accumulator plants: Gnaphalium chartaceum (accumulator of Cu, Mn, Zn, and Pb), Wigandia urens and Senecio salignus (1027 and 2477 mg kg-1 of Zn).

We collected a total of 34,766 individuals, corresponding to 72 species, most of them with marine and tropical affinities. Species richness was significantly higher in the vegetated habitat, whereas abundance (number of fish) was higher in the nonvegetated habitat. The diel pattern of abundance showed peaks at dusk and dawn, whereas richness was higher at night. Seasonally, fish abundance and species richness showed peaks during January, March, and July-September, and these peaks were related to the entry of temperate species, production processes in the system, and rainfall pattern. Fish assemblages showed significant differences among habitats, day/night, and months. In the vegetated habitat, Lagodon rhomboides, Menidia beryllina, and Orthopristis chrysoptera were the predominant species. Microphagus species such as Brevoortia gunteri, Brevoortia patronus, and Mugil curema were predominant during the warm, dry season (March-May) and they were more abundant during the day. In contrast, predatory species such as Citharichthys spilopterus and Opsanus beta were more abundant during the rainy season and their capture was higher at night. The two most numerically abundant species, Anchoa mitchilli and Membras martinica, showed a twilight pattern, with abundance peaks at dusk and dawn, respectively. Hence, in Pueblo Viejo Lagoon (Mexico), the spatiotemporal changes in species composition are in part related to predator avoidance and feeding strategies, through a coupling of life histories with the diel and seasonal variation in the availability of resources, the presence of submerged vegetation playing an important role in this dynamic.;Diversity | Fish assemblages | Mean trophic level | Predator avoidance | Ruppia maritima;6;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

However, usually for greenhouse crop models, local approaches based on the calculation of derivatives are applied. Unfortunately, the main drawback of local approaches is that derivatives provide information only at the base point where they are computed and do not take into account the rest of the variation range of the model's parameters. In contrast, several so called global sensitivity analysis approaches such as standardized regression coefficients, the elementary effect test, variance-based methods and Monte Carlo Filtering are being developed. In the present work a comparison between a local sensitivity analysis and two global sensitivity methods is carried out. The paper focuses on the methodological issues concerning both local and global sensitivities approaches, where their similarities and differences are discussed. A five-state variables greenhouse lettuce crop model is used in order to show both the strengths and also the weaknesses of the paradigms. In the case of the local method the so-called sensitivity equations are stated and solved. For the global approaches, firstly, probability density functions (PDFs) were assigned to each of the model's parameters. Secondly, five thousands Monte Carlo simulations were conducted in order to calculate the sensitivity indices and measures. The lettuce crop model was implemented in Matlab, and the global sensitivity analysis was programmed using the SimLab (ver. 3.2) software. More reliable results were obtained by the global method based on variance calculation Fourier Amplitude Sensitive Test (FAST) which indentified as the most sensitive parameters for the NICOLET model the coefficients: radiation extinction, photosynthetic efficiency, leaf conductance to CO2, specific growth rate, maintenance respiration and reference temperature.;Dynamic model | Elementary effects test | NICOLET model | Sensitivity equations | Variance-based;7;0;;;;undefined;

Disturbance in the homeostasis of glutathione has been implicated in the etiology and progression of diabetes mellitus and its complications. Material and methods: It was evaluated, the effect of an aqueous extract of Cucurbita ficifolia on glycemia, plasma lipid peroxidation; as well as levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione and activities of enzymes involved in glutathione redox cycle: glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) in liver, pancreas, kidney and heart homogenates of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Results: Increased blood glucose and lipid peroxidation, together with decreased of GSH concentration, GSH/GSSG ratio and its redox potential (Eh), and enhanced activity of GPx and GR in liver, pancreas and kidney were the salient features observed in diabetic mice. Administration of the aqueous extract of Cucurbita ficifolia to diabetic mice for 30 days, used at a dose of 200 mg/kg, resulted in a significant reduction in glycemia, polydipsia, hyperphagia and plasma lipid peroxidation. Moreover, GSH was increased in liver, pancreas and kidney, and GSSG was reduced in liver, pancreas and heart, therefore GSH/GSSG ratio and its Eh were restored. Also, the activities involved in the glutathione cycle were decreased, reaching similar values to controls. Conclusions: An aqueous extract of Cucurbita ficifolia with hypoglycemic action, improve GSH redox state, increasing glutathione pool, GSH, GSH/GSSG ratio and its Eh, mechanism that can explain, at least in part, its antioxidant properties, supporting its use as an alternative treatment for the control of diabetes mellitus, and prevent the induction of complications by oxidative stress. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.";Cucurbita ficifolia | Diabetes mellitus | Glutathione redox cycle | Lipid peroxidation | Oxidative stress;34;0;;;;undefined;

In species, such as the bobcat (Lynx rufus), with large geographical ranges, it is necessary to gather data on diverse populations across the range to better understand what might be factors influencing these home range parameters. Although there are many studies of bobcats in more northern areas of its range in the United States, few data exist from its extensive southern range in Mexico. To fill this gap in information, we collected data on home range size, daily travel distances, and diel activity patterns of bobcats from the center of the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. We compared our findings with available data from more northern studies and tested for any latitudinal trends in home range size. We trapped eight adult bobcats (four females and four males) between 2006 and 2008 at the Mapimi Biosphere Reserve in the Chihuahuan Desert. Each bobcat was equipped with a GPS radio collar that estimated their location and ambient temperature every half hour at night (1900 to 800 h), and every hour during the day (800 to 1900 h). These data were used to estimate total daily distance traveled, average speed, home range size, activity pattern, and to test for an association between hourly travel and ambient temperature. For bobcats in Mapimi, mean distances traveled daily (4.9 ± 0.7 km), mean speed (0.3 ± 0.4 km/h) and average home range size (25.9 km2 ± 3.7) did not differ from other places in U.S. (distance traveled daily 5.7 ± 1.4 km, mean speed 0.4 ± 0.4 km/h and home range size 34.0 ± 5.4 km2). Bobcats are most active from 1700 to 2300 h and from 0500 to 1200 h and showed a minimum activity period from 1300 to 1600 h. These patterns did not differ from what other studies found. Distance traveled was inversely correlated with environmental temperature (r2 = 0.506, P < 0.05). Our data demonstrate that most behaviors of bobcats in this hot desert environment did not differ in general from their more northern populations. Although our home range estimates were similar to other studies, our analysis did support a latitudinal decreasing trend that indicates factors other than those related to latitude are affecting home range size in bobcats. We suggest investigating other independent factors not related with latitude such as primary production and rainfall might help identify which, if any, of these factors contribute to home range size in bobcats.;;19;0;;;;undefined;

Pb can produce oxidative stress, disrupt the blood-brain barrier and alter several Ca2+-dependent processes, including physiological processes that involve nitric oxide synthesis on central nervous system in development and adult animals. This review summarizes recent evidence showing that Pb can interfere with the production of nitric oxide and can disrupt the function of nitric oxide synthase.

The results revealed that there were antigenic differences among the isolates assessed. In particular, the estimated correlation between the PAC-4/1993 and PAC-6/2001 (0.50) isolates and between the PAC-4/1993 and PAC-9/2003 isolates (0.56) displayed a moderate positive correlation. In contrast, there was a strong positive correlation between the PAC-6/2001 and PAC-9/2003 isolates (0.73).

By contrast, in the Estado de Mexico, all three isolates appeared to circulate with a low seroprevalence. In general, the analysed sera from the four states displayed a porcine rubulavirus serological prevalence ranging from 9% to 23.7%. These data indicate that there is not complete antibody cross-antigenicity among the three isolates, and the antigenic variations in the antibody response found in this study implies that the use of a monovalent vaccine would not generate complete protection against the different antigenic subtypes. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.";Antigenic variation | Blue eye disease | Porcine rubulavirus;19;0;;;;undefined;

We studied the population growth and life table demography of the rotifers Anuraeopsis fissa and Brachionus rubens, and the cladoceran Moina macrocopa. For this, the algae Scenedesmus acutus or Chlorella vulgaris were cultured on defined (Bold's basal) medium or the commercial liquid fertilizer (Bayfolan). Experiments were conducted at one algal concentration 1.0x106cells/mL of C. vulgaris or its equivalent dry weight of 0.5x106cells/mL of S. acutus. The population dynamics were tested at 23±1°C in 100mL transparent jars, each with 50mL of the test medium, with an initial density of 0.5indiv/mL, for a total of 48 test jars (3 zooplankton 2 algal species x 2 culture media x 4 replicates). For the life table experiments with M. macrocopa, we introduced 10 neonates (<24h old) into each test jar containing the specific algal type and concentration. For the rotifer experiments, we set 5mL tubes with one neonate each and 10 replicates for each algal species and culture medium. We found that the average rotifer life span was not influenced by the diet, but for M. macrocopa fed S. acutus cultured in Bold's medium, the average lifespan was significantly lower than with the other diets. The gross and net reproductive rates of A. fissa (ranging from 18-36 offspring per female) were significantly higher for C. vulgaris cultured in Bold medium. Regardless of the culture medium, Chlorella resulted in significantly higher gross and net reproductive rates for B. rubens than S. acutus diets. The reproductive rates of M. macrocopa were significantly higher in all the tested diets except when fed with S. acutus in Bold medium. The population increase rate, derived from growth experiments of A. fissa and B. rubens, ranged from 0.1-0.25/d and were significantly higher on C. vulgaris cultured in liquid fertilizer as compared to the other diets. The growth rates of M. macrocopa ranged from 0.1 to 0.38/d, and were highest with diets of C. vulgaris cultured in Bold medium and S. acutus cultured in fertilizer. Thus, regardless of the culture medium used, the growth rates of the evaluated zooplankton species were higher with Chlorella than with Scenedesmus. The peak population density was highest (2 800ind/mL) for A. fissa fed Chlorella that was cultured on liquid fertilizers, while B. rubens and M. macrocopa had peak abundances of 480 and 12ind/mL, respectively under similar conditions.";Algae | Cladocera | Diet | Fertilizer | Population growth | Rotifera | Zooplancton;7;0;;;;undefined;

The objective of this research was to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of TB during the period 20062010 in the State of Mexico, using geographic information system (GIS) and SCAN statistics program. Nine significant clusters (P ≤ 0.05) were identified using spatial and space-time analysis.

We used male Wistar rats to evaluate the effects of different doses of a D 1 agonist (SKF-38393) and a D 1 antagonist (SCH-23390), and their co-administration. The levels of DA and L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were measured using high performance liquid chromatography. The systemic injection of SKF-38393 alone at 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg did not alter the DA and DOPAC levels or the DOPAC/DA ratio. In contrast, injection of SCH-23390 alone at 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg significantly increased the DA and DOPAC levels, as well as the DOPAC/DA ratio, compared with the respective control groups. The co-administration of SCH-23390+SKF-38393 did not alter the DA or DOPAC levels, but it did significantly inhibit the SCH-23390-induced increase of the DA and DOPAC levels. The SCH-23390+SKF-38393 and the SCH-23390-only groups showed an increase in the DOPAC/DA ratio. The co-administration of SCH-23390+PARGYLINE significantly decreased the DOPAC levels and the DOPAC/DA ratio compared with the control and SCH-23390 groups. Taken together, our results showed that selective inhibition with SCH-23390 produced an increase in metabolized DA via striatal monoamine oxidase. These findings also contribute to the understanding of the role of postsynaptic D 1 receptors in the long-loop negative feedback system in the rat striatum. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.;Dopamine | Dopaminergic system | Monoamine oxidase | Rat | Striatum;11;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

La Niña events cause unbalanced situations in the Equatorial Pacific and result in enhanced precipitation in South West Pacific coastal areas. We investigated the impact of heavy rainfalls during the 2008 La Niña event on the New Caledonia lagoon using a 3D coupled on-line hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Simulations and data showed that the whole lagoon was impacted by river inputs and stronger hydrodynamics, enhancing chlorophyll-a concentration by a factor between 1.7 and 1.9. The coupled model provided new insights into plume transport, highlighting that eastern plumes can be advected northwards or can reach the South West Lagoon, depending on the balance between regional, tide-induced, and wind-induced surface currents. It also provided a synoptic view of lagoon biogeochemical-hydrodynamic response, when remote sensing data are not available due to cloud coverage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.;3D coupled model | Biogeochemistry | Coral reef lagoon | Freshwater inputs | Hydrodynamics | La Niña;13;0;;;;undefined;

It synthesizes specific conceptions of nature, as well as cumulative learning, beliefs and customs that are part of a particular human community or society. Traditional knowledge has been analyzed from different viewpoints, one of which corresponds to the analysis of ethnoclassifications. In this work, a brief analysis of the botanical traditional knowledge among Zapotecs of the municipality of San Agustin Loxicha, Oaxaca was conducted. The purposes of this study were: a) to analyze the traditional ecological knowledge of local plant resources through the folk classification of both landscapes and plants and b) to determine the role that this knowledge has played in plant resource management and conservation. The study was developed in five communities of San Agustín Loxicha. From field trips, plant specimens were collected and showed to local people in order to get the Spanish or Zapotec names; through interviews with local people, we obtained names and identified classification categories of plants, vegetation units, and soil types. We found a logic structure in Zapotec plant names, based on linguistic terms, as well as morphological and ecological caracteristics. We followed the classification principles proposed by Berlin [6] in order to build a hierarchical structure of life forms, names and other characteristics mentioned by people. We recorded 757 plant names. Most of them (67%) have an equivalent Zapotec name and the remaining 33% had mixed names with Zapotec and Spanish terms. Plants were categorized as native plants, plants introduced in pre-Hispanic times, or plants introduced later. All of them are grouped in a hierarchical classification, which include life form, generic, specific, and varietal categories. Monotypic and polytypic names are used to further classify plants. This holistic classification system plays an important role for local people in many aspects: it helps to organize and make sense of the diversity, to understand the interrelation among plants-soil-vegetation and to classify their physical space since they relate plants with a particular vegetation unit and a kind of soil. The locals also make a rational use of these elements, because they know which crops can grow in any vegetation unit, or which places are indicated to recollect plants. These aspects are interconnected and could be fundamental for a rational use and management of plant resources. © 2012 Luna-José and Aguilar; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";Ethnobotany | Ethnoclassification | San Agustín Loxicha | Traditional ecological knowledge | Zapotecs;9;1;repositoryvor;Green;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

These models (van der Waals equations of state, two-body Lennard-Jones and Approximate Non-Conformal potentials, and effective potentials including three-body-force effects) can be regarded as systematic improvements on the description of molecular interactions. We begin by introducing experimentally-defined parameters that characterize the mean molecular-scale energy E, volume and energy density for each fluid, showing that the experimental critical coordinates are linear functions of these mean molecular parameters. Then we use parametrizations for the fluids considered, reported in the literature, to calculate the critical coordinates for each of the models to be compared. All these models give a qualitatively-correct linear dependency of the critical coordinates with the characteristic molecular parameters, but only the introduction of three-body forces and non-conformal interactions result in quantitatively-correct predictions: both the van der Waals equations and the two-body Lennard-Jones models overestimate V C and underestimate T C and P C. The ability to predict accurately the critical constants can be useful for providing insight into basic molecular interactions, guiding experimental determination of phase diagrams, and characterizing fluids for chemical engineering applications. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.;critical point | Lennard-Jones | molecular parameter | nonconformal interaction | van der Waals equation of state;2;0;;;;undefined;

RIPs are mainly produced by different plant species, but are additionally found in a number of bacteria, fungi, algae and some mammalian tissues. This review describes the occurrence of RIPs, with special emphasis on bacterial RIPs, including the Shiga toxin and RIP in Streptomyces coelicolor recently identified in S. coelicolor.

We present a study along gestation of the baseline's fluctuations, in relation to fractal and nonlinear properties, to assess these fluctuations according with time-varying attracting levels introduced by maturing regulatory mechanisms. A low-risk pregnancy was studied weekly from the 17th to 38th week of gestation during long-term recording sessions at night (>6h). Fetal averaged pulse rate samples and corresponding baseline series were obtained from raw abdominal ECG ambulatory data. The fractal properties of these series were evaluated by applying detrended fluctuation analysis. The baseline series were also explored to evaluate nonlinear properties and time ordering by applying the scaling magnitude and sign analyses. Our main findings are that the baseline shows fractal and even nonlinear anticorrelated fluctuations. This condition was specially the case before mid-gestation, as revealed by α values near to unit, yet becoming significantly more complex after 30 weeks of gestation as indicated by α (mag) values >0.5. The structured (i.e. not random) fluctuations and particular nonlinear changes that we found thus suggest that the baseline provides on itself information concerning the functional integration of cardiac regulatory mechanisms. © 2011 IPEM.;Antenatal monitoring | Autonomic mechanisms | Pregnancy | Scaling exponent;13;0;;;CONACYT;I0003-83999;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The aim of this study was to get insights about the cardiovascular regulation of CH children by analysing their heart rate variability (HRV) data.RR-interval data of 34 early treated CH children, 24 to 48months of age, were collected at rest in a clinical environment. In all these cases, CH resulted from an abnormal development of thyroid gland. Data from 29 age matched-controls were also collected in a scholar environment. Short time series were then analysed in time and frequency domains. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) was also applied to obtain the scaling exponent α 1.We found that the HRV obtained from children with CH is diminished as suggested by statistical differences (p<0.05) in the following parameters: RMSDD, pNN20, total power, LF and HF. However, no significant differences were found in the LF/HF ratio, the central frequencies of the LF and HF bands, as well as in α 1.Given that the significant differences were basically reflected in static parameters rather than in the frequency distribution or scale-invariant behaviour of the studied data, we consider that the analysis points toward the effect of treatment on rising heart rate by the thyroid hormone, and not necessarily toward any residual autonomic dysfunction, as the dominant underlying cause of the diminished HRV exhibited by CH children. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..;Congenital hypothyroidism | Heart rate variability | Scaling exponent | Time and frequency parameters;2;0;;;CONACYT;83999;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Egg development at a temperature of 24 ± 1 °C occurred in five stages based on coloration: stage 1 (day 1-10), bright orange; stage 2 (day 11-24), orange; stage 3 (day 25-29), gray; stage 4 (day 30-34), light gray; and stage 5 (35-37), white, visible larvae. Females spawned at least twice and were receptive to males after each spawning event, although no spermatophore transfer was observed. The adaptive capacity of L dubiato captivity makes its use feasible in breeding under controlled conditions, suggesting that it has potential for aquaculture.";Aquaculture | Libinia dubia | Octopus bait | Spider crab;7;0;;;;undefined;

About 20, first lactation cows were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: Tl = control, T2 = selenium and vitamin E. Identical management and diets were fed in both treatments. Performance responses to Selenium (Se) and vitamin E supplementation increases (p<0.05) daily Milk Production (MP) Tl = 8.63 vs. T2 = 9.34, percentage of Crude Protein (CP), Solids Non Fat (SNF) and lactose. Percentage of Milk Fat (MF) and content of Total Solids (TS) was not affected by treatment (p>0.05). Decreased number (p<0.05) of Somatic Cells Count (SCC) was attributable to dietary Se and vitamin E supplementation (2.053 vs. 1.509). Body Condition Score (BCS) in both treatments was similar between treatments (2.5-3.0). Researchers conclude that the incorporation of Se and vitamin E in commercial diets of grazing first lactation cows increases MP and percentage of CP, SNF and lactose content and decreases SCC while BCS of animals were unaffected by treatment. This data confirm earlier findings that Se and vitamin E supplementation are related to mammary health gland. The performance and economic feasibility of the use of selenium plus Vit. E allowed us to obtain a profit margin of $0.21 (US cents) per animal per day in this study. © Medwell Journals, 2012.;Body condition | Dairy cattle | Milk | Production and quality | Selenium-vitamin E | Somatic cell;12;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The Symposium covered different topics on pharmacogenetics and its clinical implications, focusing on Latin-American populations. The activities of the ESPT were also presented and discussed. The topics addressed were regulatory aspects, the use of pharmacogenetics in pre-clinical research, herbal medicine, and natural products, ending with a discussion about translation into clinical practice, specifically for cardiovascular disorders and psychiatry. Finally, the implication for population diversity in Latin America was also discussed. The RIBEF initiative represents a promising step towards the inclusion of Latin American populations among those to benefit from the implementation of pharmacogenetics in clinical practice. Among current RIBEF activities, the CEIBA.FP Consortium aims to study the variability of pheno-and genotypes in Hispanics that are relevant to pharmacogenetics. For this purpose, populations from Mexico, Cuba, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia, Brasil, Perú, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Portugal, and Spain are currently being studied. The meeting's main conclusion was that population pharmacogenetic studies as well as academic clinical trials might need to be conducted in the different geographic locations/countries. This is important in order to improve drug safety, dosage recommendations, and pharmacovigilance programs, because environmental and ethnic factors vary across locations. © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.";cytochrome P450 | Hispanics | Latin America | pharmacogenetics;15;0;;;ISCIII;CP06/0030;Instituto de Salud Carlos III

We implanted the VAD in six healthy sheep by inserting the stainless-steel inflow cannula into the left ventricular apex and suturing the outflow graft to the descending thoracic aorta. The anesthetized animals were supported for 6 hours, and pump performance, hemodynamic parameters, and hemolysis were monitored. The pump maintained a blood flow of 4.4 ± 0.8 L/min and an arterial blood pressure of 76 ± 15 mm Hg. At 6 hours, the plasma free hemoglobin concentration was 5.11 ± 0.6 mg/dl (baseline value, 4.52 ± 0.7 mg/dl). The VAD was easy to implant and deair and performed well during the 6 hour period. After successful short-term results, we similarly implanted the VAD in two healthy sheep for 30 days. The animals reached the scheduled end point without device-related problems. Postmortem examination of the explanted organs revealed small infarcted areas in the kidneys of one animal, but renal function was unaffected; the animal also had two thrombi (3 and 7 mm) on the outlet valve. This device may offer a simple, economical alternative to currently available VADs.

PAH determination was made by Soxhlet extraction and chromatographic clean-up with final analysis by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. The concentrations in Tlahuac were 9.13 mg/kg (dry season) and 11.22 mg/kg (wet season) and in Milpa Alta were 11.43 mg/kg (dry season) and 35.77 mg/kg (wet season). The variation of total PAH concentrations are due to environmental and anthropogenic conditions within Mexico City and also the addition of compost to the soils. According to Mexican regulations BaP, DaA, BbF and Ind were within the permissible limit (2 mg/kg) for agricultural and residential soils and BkF was close to the limit (8 mg/kg). The total PAH concentrations do however surpass the permissible European limit of 1,000 μg/kg and there is probably some risk to human health, in spite of measures aimed at decreasing contamination in Mexico City.

Developing countries have the highest incidence of malnourished children, and approximately 60% of deaths that occur in children under five are directly related to malnutrition and associated diseases. The relationship between malnutrition and genetic damage has been widely studied in humans and animal models. The micronucleus (MN) assay is useful in detecting chromosome damage induced by several factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of infection and malnutrition on the frequency of MN in erythrocytes from the peripheral blood of well-nourished, uninfected (WN) and well-nourished, infected (WNI) children, and moderately malnourished (UNM) and severely malnourished (UNS) children, both with infection, using a flow cytometric analysis technique. The percentage of reticulocytes (RETs) was significantly higher (1.5-fold) in WNI children than well-nourished controls. In addition, the UNS group had a 2.2-fold increase in the percentage of RETs compared to the WNI group. The frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RETs) was 2.5 times greater, in WNI group compared to the WN group. These frequencies were significantly higher (1.7- and 2.1-fold) in UNM and UNS, respectively, compared to the WNI group. The results suggest that infection and malnutrition induce DNA damage in children. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.;Infection | Malnourished children | Malnutrition | Micronucleated reticulocytes | Micronuclei;27;0;;;CONACYT;50804;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

However, the specific limbic structures implied in the antidepressant-like actions of folic acid are un-known. Thus, intra-lateral septal infusions of folic acid (5.0. nmol, P < 0.05; 10.0 nmol, P < 0.05) or oral administrations of folic acid (50. mg/kg, P < 0.05, p.o.; 75.0; mg/kg, P < 0.05, p.o.) or systemic administrations of fluoxetine (20.0. mg/kg, P < 0.05; 25.0 mg/kg, P < 0.05) reduced immobility by increasing swimming behavior in the forced swimming test (FST) of male Wistar rats. Conversely, desipramine (10.0 mg/kg, P < 0.05; 15.0. mg/kg, P < 0.05) reduced immobility by increasing climbing behavior. Subthreshold doses of folic acid (2.5. nmol/intra-LSN) combined with subthreshold doses of folic acid (25.0. mg/kg, p.o., P < 0.05) or with subthreshold doses of fluoxetine (15.0. mg/kg, P < 0.05) and they produced antidepressant-like effects which were canceled by ketanserin. In conclusion, intra-lateral septal infusions of folic acid alone or combined with systemic doses of folic acid or fluoxetine reduced immobility in the FST.

Although the hypoglycemic effect of both plants has been demonstrated and some active compounds proposed, their mechanisms are still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if the incubation with both aqueous extracts avoids the inhibition of contraction induced by phenylephrine similarly to glibenclamide in rat aortic rings. The hypoglycemic aqueous extracts of C. ficifolia and I. sonorae were characterized for their content of either D-chiro inositol or cucurbitanes respectively, and then we assayed the characterized extracts in vitro on the diazoxide-induced relaxation of rat aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine, using as positive control glibenclamide. I. sonorae extract blocked the KATP channels in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.05), whereas C. ficifolia extract had no effect on these channels. I. sonorae extract produces a hypoglycemic effect through a similar mechanism to sulphonylureas in this experimental model; however, hypoglycemic action of C. ficifolia extract should be explained by an independent KATP channels mechanism. © 2012 Boletín Latinoamericano y del Caribe de Plantas Medicinales y Aromáticas.";Cucurbita ficifolia | Cucurbitaceae | Diabetes mellitus | Hypoglycemic plants | Ibervillea sonorae | Vascular smooth muscle;7;0;;;;undefined;

These chemosignals can be detected by two olfactory systems, namely the main or the accessory olfactory systems. While initially anatomically segregated, both systems converge functionally as they can detect and process overlapping sets of chemosignals. This convergence also takes place at the level of their central projections in the hypothalamus. It is probably at this level that future investigations will be needed. Indeed, if the physiology of both olfactory system and reproductive function are now quite well characterized, the interrelation between both systems is unclear. Among the many cell populations that can serve as targets or relays for the pheromonal information in the hypothalamus are GnRH cells or the recently discovered Kisspeptin population which have been showed to be activated after pheromonal activation. However, many works will be needed before having a definitive picture.;GnRH | Kisspeptin | Main and accessory olfactory systems | Pheromone | Reproductive axis;0;0;;;;undefined;

This seasonality causes a seasonality of milk, cheese and meat production. To solve this problem it is necessary to have a deep knowledge of the annual sexual activity of animals and to identify the environmental factor controlling the timing of the annual reproductive cycle. In this review we will describe our approach to develop sustainable techniques to control reproductive activity in goats from subtropical Mexico: 1) The characteristics of the annual breeding season in both male and female goats were determined; 2) Photoperiod was identified as the major environmental factor controlling the timing of the annual breeding season; 3) Photoperiod treatments were used to stimulate the sexual activity of bucks during the non-breeding season; 4) Male goats rendered sexually active were used to induce and synchronize the estrous behavior and ovulatory activity of anestrous does in confined or grazing conditions by the male effect; 5) We determined that nutritional supplementation during the male effect improves the reproductive response of females exposed to the sexually active males. These results constitute an original manner to control the reproductive activity of goats using photoperiod, the male effect and nutrition.";Biostimulation | Day length | Feeding | Goats | Melatonin | Reproductive seasonality;1;0;;;;undefined;

The use of ethnographic methods allowed developing a deep understanding of collective action through access to the archives of the Association and through in-depth interviews. The research results focus on the idea that this Association represents an example of local development building and transformation of regional conflicts through collective action, which advocates for the communitarian autonomy and the food sovereignty of the peoples of the Magdalena Medio.

Method: Data are reported from emergency department studies in 14 countries on the prevalence of patients' self-report of drinking within the 6 hours before the violence-related injury event, patients' belief that the event would not have happened if they had not been drinking at the time, and patients' perception that the perpetrator had been drinking. Alcohol-attributable fraction was calculated based on the patients' perception that their own drinking was causally related to the event and on their perception that the perpetrator had been drinking. Results: Across all countries, 62.9% of the violence-related injuries involved alcohol use on the part of the victim, the perpetrator, or both. Rates of others definitely drinking, as perceived by the victim, ranged from 14% to 73% across countries and was positively associated with patients' own drinking in the event and with attributing a causal association between their drinking and the event. Estimates of alcohol-attributable fraction were 38.8% when the victim and perpetrator were considered together compared with 23.9% when only the patient was considered and varied by country-level drinking pattern. Conclusions: These findings suggest adjustments that could be made to global burden of disease estimates because of violence-related injury morbidity to better reflect alcohol-attributable fraction when drinking by others and country-level drinking patterns are taken into account.

Female Wistar rats were exposed during gestation and lactation to a Pb solution containing 320ppm of Pb acetate through drinking water. After weaning, the pups were maintained with the same drinking water until sacrificed at 90days of age. Pb levels in the blood, hypothalamus, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were significantly increased in the experimental group. Chronic early Pb exposure induced a significant increase in the minor and major axes and somatic area of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and vasopressin (VP)-immunoreactive neurons. The density of VIP-, VP- and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive cells showed a significant decrease in the experimental group. OD analysis showed a significant increase in VIP neurons of the experimental group.

Objective: To compare the local control in CPNM with superficial brachytherapy (BQT) of high dose rate (HDR) with Leipzig or mold. Methods: Retrospective research in 70 patients with CPNM in head and neck area, treated only with BQT, superficial HDR, in the BQT Department of the Radiotherapy Service in Hospital General de Mexico from April 1st 2005 to December 31st, 2009. Patients were divided into 5 non-homogenous groups (nose, eye, face, hand and ear). On one group, three of the patients had more than two injuries, so two mold and Leipzig applicators were used to treat them; the patients were analyzed on a separate group. In all the cases the prescribed dose was 5064 cGy in 12 fractions, 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) for 4 weeks. In the applicator's choice the type of surface was essential. In homogenous surfaces Leipzig applicators were used while in the inhomogeneous surface the mold applicator was chosen to guarantee the dose prescription. Results: It was found that in the 5 groups the local control is similar with the 2 types of applicators, except for the external ear canal in which the local failure is presented in up to 20%. Conclusion: In CPNM head and neck area local control is up to 95% with the superficial brachytherapy (BQT) use of high doses rate (HDR). The surface type must be taken into account in the applicators choice (Leipzig or mould). The late toxicity percentage (hyperpigmentation) was 21.4% with Leipzeig and 40% with mould.";High rate doses | Leipzig | Mexico | Mold | Non melanoma skin cancer | Superficial brachytherapy;0;0;;;;undefined;

Coffee pulp was used as the sole source of nutrients. An increase in the fraction of bonded particles was observed in the bottle reactors after 12 h of cultivation when no mixing was applied. The use of any mixing frequency reduced the fraction of bonded particles. However, there was no significant difference in pectin methylesterase production between the mixing frequencies at the end of the fermentation.

All these elementary neuromotor patterns are characterized by a high degree of organization, persistence, and stereotypy. In many regards, these patterns are predecessors or precursors of from them the specific human motor patterns which appear spontaneously later as crawling, creeping, sitting, and walking with erect posture. On the basis of our experiences it can be stated that the elementary neuromotor patterns can be activated in all neonates and young infants as congenital motor functions. With regards to their main properties and functional forms, the normal patterns can be divided into two main groups: (1) One group is characterized by lifting of the head and complex chains of movements which are directed to the verticalization of the body; (2) The other group is characterized by complex movements directed to locomotion and change of body position. The neuromotor patterns can be activated by placing the human infant in specific body positions that trigger the vestibulospinal and the reticulospinal systems, the archicerebellum and the basal gangliae. Most of these systems display early myelinisation and are functioning very soon. Many of the elementary neuromotor patterns reflect the most important - spontaneously developing - forms of human movements such as sitting upright in space and head elevation crawling and walking. The majority of the human neuromotor patterns are human specific. When the infant is put in an activating position, crawling, sitting up, and walking begin and last as long as the activating position is maintained. Each elementary neuromotor pattern is a repeated, continuous train of complex movements in response to a special activating position. The brainstem is not sufficient to organize these complex movements, the integrity of the basal ganglia is also necessary. Elementary sensorimotor patterns during human ontogenesis reflect phylogenetic develpoment of species specific human functions. During ontogenesis spontaneous motor development gradually arises from these early specific sensorimotor predecessors.. The regular use of the elementary neuromotor patterns for diagnostic puposes has several distinct advantages. The neuromotor patterns have a natural stereotypy in normal infants and, therefore, deflections from this regular pattern may be detected easily, thus, the activation of the elementary neuromotor pattern is a more suitable method tor identifying defects in the motor activity of the neonate or young infant than the assessment of the primitive reflexes. The ""stiumulus positions,"" which activate specific movements according to how the human neonate or young infant is positioned, do not activate such motor patterns in neonate or young primates including apes. The characteristic locomotor pattern in these adult primates, including the apes, is swinging and involves brachiation with an extreme prehensility. This species specific motor activity is reflected in the orangutan and gibbon neonates by an early extensive grasp. However, according to our investigations, no crawling, creeping, elementary walk, or sitting up can be activated in them. Neonates grasp the hair of the mother, a vital function for the survival of the young. In contemporary nonhuman primates including apes, the neonate brain is more mature. Thus, pronounced differences can be observed between early motor ontogenesis in the human and all other primates. The earliest human movements are complex performances rather than simple reflexes. The distinction between primitive reflexes and elementary neuromotor patterns is essential. Primitive reflexes are controlled by the brainstem. All can be activated in primates. These reflexes have short durations and contrary to elementary sensorimotor patterns occur only once in response to one stimulus, e.g., one head drop elicits one abduction-adduction of the upper extremities correlated to adduction and flexion of the lower extremities to a lesser degree with the Moro reflex. Elementary neuromotor patterns are much more complex and most of them including elementary walk may be elicited as early as the 19th-20th gestational week, though less perfectly than later.";Developmental neurology | Elementary sensorimotor patterns | Phylo- and ontogenesis | Vestibular system;0;0;;;;undefined;

The analyzed parameters were amount of soluble aluminum, radical growth, tolerance rate, bioaccumulation factor, and tissues aluminum concentration. The main limiting factor for aluminum accumulation is the availability of the metal. However, Coleus blumei can grow and accumulate up to 1445.7 mg kg-1 of aluminum dry base. This plant can play an important role in the treatment of polluted water with metals, since it can grow in conditions with a pH of around 4.8. The aluminum tolerance rate showed for this plant ranged between 18.8% and 25%.

Therefore, to study the participation of the main efferent projections from the cerebellum to the forebrain, we injected small doses of kainic acid (KA) into the deep cerebellar nuclei to selectively injure neighboring cells while avoiding fiber lesions. Uninjured fibers were confirmed using histological findings and by assessing the number of cells in the main cerebellar afferents, compared with controls. Under such conditions, we found that dentate and interpositus nuclei lesions interfere with seizure expression, both at early kindling acquisition and at the kindled stage. We hypothesize that the cerebellar effect on epilepsy drives skeletal motor responses, mainly in generalized seizures when the thalamus and neocortex are affected. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.;Cerebellum | Dentate nucleus | Interpositus nucleus | Kainic acid | Kindling;8;0;;;;49920-Q;

For this reason we were interested in determining the role of α-Tocopherol using experimental cryptorchidism, followed by orchidopexia in neonatal rats. Eighty-four, 10-day-postpartum (dpp) male rats (Wistar strain) were used and divided into 7 groups: healthy control, sham with α-Tocopherol treated with 30 or 100mg/kg doses, sham vehicle, cryptorchidism treated with α-Tocopherol at 30 or 100mg/kg doses and cryptorchidism vehicle. Cryptorchidism was surgically induced at 10 dpp. At 25 dpp the animals were treated with α-Tocopherol and the vitamin vehicle. Lipoperoxidation and testicular morphology was determined in half of the animals at 40 dpp (short term). The remaining animals underwent orchidopexia and fertility was determined at 90 dpp. Testicular morphology was determined at 120 dpp (long term) in these animals. A significant reduction of lipoperoxidation was observed in the cryptorchid group treated with α-Tocopherol compared to the untreated cryptorchid group, in addition to short-term histological alterations. At long term, we observed an increase in the area and maturation of the seminiferous epithelium, a decrease in apoptosis and histological alterations and an increase in fertility from α-Tocopherol treatment. α-Tocopherol treatment decreased lipoperoxidation, possibly stabilizing free radicals produced during cryptorchidism, reducing morphological testicular alterations and favoring fertility. © 2011 The Authors.

The effective ATM interaction is written as a two-body density-dependent potential and is obtained by averaging the ATM function over the position of the third particle. It is shown that the addition of the mean ATM potential does not affect much the form of the binary interaction and so it can be incorporated as an effect on the minimum of the potential (position and depth). The underlying binary potentials are modelled by Approximate Non-Conformal (ANC) functions that have been proven to be highly accurate in accounting for effective pair interactions in many fluids of interest. The final total effective potential, binary plus ternary, is expressed in terms of the same ANC functions. The adequacy of the effective three-body force thus found is tested by looking at the pressure and specific heat of various fluids, formed by small nonpolar molecules, in the region of moderate densities where a third-virial approximation is reliable, and then comparing them against experimental results. The critical temperatures and volumes of those fluids are also calculated and the three-body effects on them are assessed. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.;Axilrod-Teller-Muto interaction | critical point | effective potential | specific heat | third virial coefficient | three-body forces;16;0;;;CONACYT;SEP-2003-C-3485;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

For that purpose, the seismic response of four two-dimensional frame models representative of typical steel buildings designed in a region of high seismicity was analyzed prior to and after including buckling-restrained braces as a retrofit strategy. The braces were designed following Force-Based and Displacement-Based approaches. The structural performance of the different versions of the frames was evaluated by subjecting each one to a set of twenty ground motions representative of the design earthquake with 10% exceedance probability in fifty years. It was observed that buckling-restrained braces allow for an efficient reduction in the peak drift demands in the retrofitted frames. However, since the beneficial effect of the braces cannot be fully controlled under a Force-Based design approach, it was concluded that a Displacement-Based design approach is the best option to achieve optimum structural performance. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;;23;0;;;;undefined;

Ninety six, 10min ECG recordings were collected along gestation (7 to 39weeks). Corresponding RR fluctuations series were analysed to obtain the RMSSD, α1, α1(mag) and α1(sign) parameters. Four groups covering first, second and last trimesters of gestation were conformed. No significant changes in α1, which was close to unit, and α1(sign) among gestational groups were identified. But, in accordance with previous findings, we did find a significant reduction of RMSSD along gestation, and significant short-term changes that indicate a higher degree of nonlinearity after about 26weeks of gestation (α1(mag)>0.5)). These results suggest that the short-term heart rate dynamics of low risk pregnant women do not become compromised during gestation, despite the increased haemodynamic demands and other ongoing adaptations. Yet the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the cardiac regulation of pregnant women does seem to increase from mid-pregnancy, possibly owing to new short-term control influences or to modifications regardless the strength of the regulatory interactions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.;Autonomic mechanisms | Pregnancy | RR dynamics | Scaling exponent;14;0;;;CONACYT;I0003-83999;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Three groups of 50 piglets each were classified according to their birth weight into normal (1000-1350 g), low (below 1000 g), and high (over 1350 g). In comparison to piglets within normal weight, those born with high birth weights showed acid-base imbalance as reflected by lower pH levels (7.03±0.01), hypercapnia (88.50±13.20 mmHg), and lactic acidosis (lactate levels: 89.40±26.30). These piglets had lower viability scores (5.40±0.60) and longer periods of time to contact the udder (52.30±8.30) than piglets with normal birth weight. In conclusion, data show that piglets with birth weight over 1350 g are at a higher risk of gross neurophysiological deficits, probably secondary to neonatal hypoxia.;Acid-base imbalance | Asphyxia | Fetal viability | Newborn | Piglet;15;1;publisherfullgold;Gold;;undefined;

We used an integrated approach to study the spatial arrangement of clonal plants by combining molecular and ecological data using Opuntia microdasys as a study system. The species is able to produce two types of clonal (plantlets and cladodes) and one type of sexual (seeds) offspring. Additionally it is found in three habitats that cause differences in the ability of each type of offspring to establish. In 2007, all individuals in the three habitats (162 in BH = bajada, 264 in IDH = hill-piedmont, and 136 at HPH = interdunes) were tagged and mapped. Amplified inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR's) were used to determine the multilocus genotype and relatedness of each individual ramet using 120 polymorphic bands (104 in BH, 128 in HPH and 180 in IDH). The spatial distribution pattern of genets and ramets was analyzed with the Hopkins test and spatial autocorrelation analysis. For all habitats we found that O. microdasys displayed a spatial distribution characterized by clumps of aggregated ramets, but habitats differed in the number of genets present. As for other clonal species a strong positive spatial autocorrelation exists within 20 m, although all analyses suggest that adjacent ramets are genetically less related to each other or belong to different genets, that is, ramets of different genets are intermingled. The spatial arrangement of genets and ramets in O. microdasys between habitats closely matches the frequency of establishment of each type of offspring (e. g. the more clonal areas are clumped groups of related individuals). These results confirm that in two habitats (BH and IDH) clonal recruitment had been more common than in the other habitat (HPH). © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.;Cactaceae | Chihuahuan Desert | Clonal genetic structure | Genet | Opuntia | Ramet;5;0;;;;undefined;

Meat traceability is an essential tool for successful identification and recall of contaminated products from the market during a food crisis. Meat traceability is also extremely important for protection and value enhancement of good-quality brands. Molecular meat traceability would allow verification of conventional methods used for beef tracing in synthetic Mexican bovine breeds. We evaluated a set of 11 microsatellites for their ability to identify animals belonging to these synthetic breeds, Brangus and Charolais/ Brahman (78 animals). Seven microsatellite markers allowed sample discrimination with a match probability, defined as the probability of finding two individuals sharing by chance the same genotypic profile, of 10-8. The practical application of the marker set was evaluated by testing eight samples from carcasses and pieces of meat at the slaughterhouse and at the point of sale. The DNA profiles of the two samples obtained at these two different points in the production-commercialization chain always proved that they came from the same animal. © FUNPEC-RP.;Meat traceability | Microsatellite markers | Synthetic breeds;9;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

We found a molten globule like species (A state) similar to that previously reported for bromelain and S-carboxy-methyl-papain. We demonstrated that this A state is not thermodynamically stable but a metastable conformer which decays into an unfolded conformation in a few hours. The mechanism of acid unfolding to the A state proved to be completely irreversible, with a biphasic time evolution of spectroscopic signals characteristic of the existence of a kinetic intermediate. This latter species showed properties in-between native and A state such as secondary structure, exposition of hydrophobic area and tryptophan environment, but a native like hydrodynamic radius. Native papain seems to unfold at acid pH through at least two kinetic barriers, being its proregion mandatory to conduct and stabilize its active structure. Computer simulations of acid unfolding, followed by ANS docking, identified three regions of cavity formation induced by acid media which might be used as regions to be fortified by protein engineering in the quest for extreme-resistant proteases or as hot-spots for protease inactivation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.;Circular dichroism | Intrinsic and ANS fluorescence | Kinetic intermediate | Molecular mechanism of acid unfolding | Proteinase denaturation | Stability and irreversibility | Thiol or cysteine protease;4;0;;;CONACYT;105532;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Entamoeba histolytica is a parasitic protozoan able to use holoTf as a sole iron source in vitro. The mechanism by which this parasite scavenges iron from holoTf is unknown. An E. histolytica holoTf-binding protein (EhTfbp) was purified by using an anti-human transferrin receptor (TfR) monoclonal antibody. EhTfbp was identified by MS/MS analysis and database searches as E. histolytica acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase-2 (EhADH2), an iron-dependent enzyme. Both EhTfbp and EhADH2 bound holoTf and were recognized by the anti-human TfR antibody, indicating that they correspond to the same protein. It was found that the amoebae internalized holoTf through clathrin-coated pits, suggesting that holoTf endocytosis could be important for the parasite during colonization and invasion of the intestinal mucosa and liver. © 2011 SGM.;;17;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Treated fruit exhibited a significantly higher Gram positive bacteria growth on the rind (4-5logCFU/g) than that detected in control fruit (2.5-3.75logCFU/g). This result was corroborated by observing a high population of lactobacilli in scanning electron micrographs and by measurement of the content of lactic acid produced. Treated fruit displayed significantly (α≤0.05) reduced color losses as indicated by the higher L* and C* values in comparison with the untreated ones. Additionally, cyanidin-3-rutinoside and total anthocyanin contents supported the measured color retention, since the pericarp of fruit treated with Lb. plantarum showed a significantly higher concentration of pigments than those used as control.

Dopamine (DA) quantification is presented using a screen-printed electrode modified by electropolymerization of cyclodextrin with glucose oxidase, SPE/MWCNT/β-CD-GOx. In order to show the relevance of the enzyme entrapment strategy controlled by electropolymerization to develop a specific and efficient biosensor, the various parts composing the electrode: SPE, SPE/β-CD, SPE/GOx, SPE/β-CD/GOx, SPE/MWCNT/β-CD, SPE/MWCNT/GOx and SPE/MWCNT/β-CD/GOx were tested separately. It was shown that although DA determination can be achieved with all of them, the electrodes modified with MWCNT presented better analytical features that those built without MWCNT, the best being the one including all components. This biosensor displayed good reproducibility, repeatability, and prolonged life-time under cold storage conditions. Its DA limit of detection (LOD) was 0.48±0.02μA in a linear range of 10-50μM with a sensitivity of 0.0302±0.0003μAμM-1 that makes it comparable or even better than many other electrodes reported in the literature. Moreover, it was also shown that using this electrode, DA quantification can be done in the presence of interfering agents such as ascorbic and uric acid. These findings demonstrate that the approach employed is feasible for enzyme entrapment and may find applications in other biosensing systems, where better sensitivity, stability and fast response are required. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.;β-Cyclodextrin | Carbon nanotubes | Dopamine | Electropolymerization entrapment | Glucose oxidase | Screen-printed electrodes;50;0;;;CONACYT;105024;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Information about the representatives of this genus along the Brazilian coast is limited to a few floristic surveys in scattered localities. The present work presents the results of a survey of Codium along the Brazilian coast, with emphasis on the taxonomy and distribution of its component taxa. Material was collected from numerous beaches along the Brazilian coast, supplemented by samples in Brazilian herbaria and in California (Berkeley-UC). Eight species were recognized: C. decorticatum, C. intertextum, C. isthmocladum, C. profundum, C. repens, C. spongiosum, C. taylorii, and a repent Codium sp. A key to these species is given. Due to the great morphological plasticity observed in C. decorticatum, C. isthmocladum and C. taylorii, it was difficult to identify some specimens with certainty. C. isthmocladum, C. decorticatum, C. taylorii, and C. intertextum proved to have the widest distribution along the Brazilian coast. © 2010 J. Cramer in Gebr.

Oncidiinae was recovered as monophyletic and characterized by the presence of abaxial and adaxial leaf papillae. Seven structural synapomorphies define 5 clades with strong support, including: 1) the Lockhartia clade defined by a conduplicate leaf blade, 2) the Trichocentrum clade, defined by a blade anphistomatic and 2 or more strata of vascular bundles, 3) a clade composed of the genera Fernandezia, Ornithocephalus and Telipogon, grouped by the absence of stegmata in the vascular bundles and by their monopodic growth, 4) a large clade composed of most derived clades of Oncidiinae, defined by the presence of 2 strata on the adaxial hypodermis, 5) Tolumnia clade, defined by a marginally conduplicate leaf blade. Most of the additional clades are supported by structural character combinations; the Miltonia y Trichopilia clades, as well as the terminal branches of clades with intermediate position in the trees are not supported by structural characters.

Zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules were incorporated into the porous network of titanium dioxide (TiO2) using the sol-gel method. It was prepared from stock solutions of ZnPc and TiO2. ZnPc-TiO2 was tested with four cancer cell lines. The characterization of supported ZnPc showed that phthalocyanine is linked by the N-pyrrole to the support and is stable up to 250°C, leading to testing for PDT. The preferential localization in target organelles such as mitochondria or lysosomes could determine the cell death mechanism after PDT. The results suggest that nanoparticulated TiO2 sensitized with ZnPc is an excellent candidate as sensitizer in PDT against cancer and infectious diseases.

Both transportation periods caused higher than normal plasma glucose levels, lactic acidosis and evidence of dehydration. The linear regression analysis for pigs transported for 8h indicates that the PO2, lactate and Ca++ variables correlated negatively with the PCO2. Whilst the animals that were transported for 16h had negative correlations between glucose, and calcium, hematocrit, lactate and potassium levels. It was concluded that regardless of transport time acidosis, hypocapnia, hypoxaemia, hypernatraemia, hypercalcaemia, hyperglycemia, lactacidemia and increased hematocrit levels occurred. © 2010.;Animal welfare | Hematocrit | Pigs | Stress assessment | Transportation period;59;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Cass. (Asteraceae) is used medicinally to treat diabetes, rheumatic pains, as well as gastrointestinal and kidney ailments. Previous pharmacological and chemical assays have demonstrated that an aqueous fraction from Psacalium peltatum (AP-fraction) contains a carbohydrate-type compound with hypoglycemic activity. Nevertheless, studies have not yet considered the hypoglycemic action of the AP-faction by sub-chronic administration nor on other healing properties, some of which might be associated with DM2 and other inflammatory processes. Aim of study: To determine whether a hypoglycemic carbohydrate fraction (AP-fraction) from Psacalium peltatum roots has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mice. Material and methods: Healthy mice received either saline, the AP-fraction with a high content of fructans, or pioglitazone (a positive control) daily by gavage. After 15 days of treatment, these animals received a single intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin and all treatments were continued for additional 33 days. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the AP-fraction were evaluated through the quantification of biomarkers of oxidative stress (glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA)) and inflammation (interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and IL-10). Results: The AP-fraction reduced glycemia and the glycated hemoglobin. Furthermore, animals treated with the AP-fraction had increased GSH, while MDA was decreased in the liver and the heart, without changes in the kidneys and the pancreas. The AP-fraction significantly reduced TNF-α serum levels but did not modify IL-6; in addition, this fraction increased IFN-γ and IL-10 levels. The increase in IL-10 levels may indicate an inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, whereas the increase in IFN-γ might be indicative of a beneficial effect on the immune system. Conclusions: The AP-fraction hypoglycemic fructans from Psacalium peltatum roots showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The Psacalium peltatum hypoglycemic fructans may be valuable in preventing insulin resistance, as well as the development and progression of diabetic complications caused by chronic inflammation. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.";Antioxidant activity | Asteraceae | Cytokines | Diabetes mellitus | Fructans | Hypoglycemic plants | Psacalium peltatum;21;0;;;IFS;undefined;International Foundation for Science

Classification of plant RIPs is based on the absence (type I) or presence (type II) of an additional lectin module. In Shiga toxin, sugar binding is mediated by a distinct RIP-associated homopentamer. In the genome of two actinomycetes, we identified RIP-like proteins that resemble plant type I RIPs rather than the RIP subunit (StxA) of Shiga toxin. Some representatives of β- and γ-proteobacteria also contain genes encoding RIP-like proteins, but these are homologous to StxA. Here, we describe the isolation and initial characterization of the RIP-like gene product SCO7092 (RIPsc) from the Gram-positive soil bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. The ripsc gene was expressed in Escherichia coli as a recombinant protein of about 30 kDa, and displayed the characteristic N-glycosidase activity causing specific rRNA depurination. In Streptomyces lividans and E. coli, RIPsc overproduction resulted in a dramatic decrease in the growth rate. In addition, intracellular production was deleterious for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, when applied externally to microbial cells, purified RIPsc did not display antibacterial or antifungal activity, suggesting that it cannot enter these cells. In a cell-free system, however, purified S. coelicolor RIPsc protein displayed strong inhibitory activity towards protein translation. © 2010 SGM.;;12;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

In particular, this study developed models to evaluate the potential to contain human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection using a genetically engineered 'hunter' virus that kills HIV-1-infected cells. First, we constructed a novel model for understanding the progression of HIV infection that predicted the loss of the immune system's CD4+ T cells across time. Subsequently, it determined the effects of introducing hunter viruses in restoring cell population. The model implemented direct and indirect mechanisms by which HIV-1 may cause cell depletion and an immune response. Results suggest that the slow progression of HIV infection may result from a slowly decaying CTL immune response, leading to a limited but constant removal of uninfected CD4 resting cells through apoptosis - and from resting cell proliferation that reduces the rate of cell depletion over time. Importantly, results show that the hunter virus does restrain HIV infection and has the potential to allow major cell recovery to 'functional' levels. Further, the hunter virus persisted at a reduced HIV load and was effective either early or late in the infection. This study indicates that hunter viruses may halt the progression of the HIV infection by restoring and sustaining high CD4 + T-cell levels. © 2010 SGM.;;1;1;repositoryvor;Green;NIAID;R03AI060468;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Five different concentrations of the surfactants, 5, 50, 100, 250 and 500 mg/L, were tested. SLS was biodegraded at concentrations of 5, 50 and 100 mg/L with flocculent sludge and at 100 and 250 mg/L with granular sludge. However an inhibitory effect on methane production was observed in both sludges at 500 mg/L. The results indicate that SDBS was not biodegradable under anoxic conditions.

Modelling approaches are a useful tool for studying such a complex coastal environment. In this study, we carried out the development of a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamical-biogeochemical model of the south-west lagoon of New Caledonia. The biogeochemical model presented in Faure et al. (2006, 2010) was dynamically coupled with a hydrodynamical model (MARS3D) in order to study the short-term variability of the ecosystem. Two simulations (in winter and summer) were then performed from measured initial conditions using realistic wind and irradiance conditions and river inputs. Examinations of the biogeochemical response to these transient meteorological conditions were presented and compared with temporal field data corresponding to the considered periods. Results highlighted the ecosystem functioning, based on the balance of hydrodynamical and biogeochemical processes. Influence of urban and terrigeneous inputs were limited to the coastal zone. The model accurately reproduced the measured Chl.a and bacterial production, highlighting the improvement made on the biogeochemical model. However, the underestimation of some variables in model outputs, in particular nutrients, led us to focus on different inputs, such as sediment inputs which were not taken into account or properly estimated. Moreover, the role of boundary waters appeared crucial and suggested a calibration effort. Last, the final aim of our modelling study will help the development of a useful tool for studying the key processes of the ecosystem of the south-west lagoon of New Caledonia, as well as the examination of the biogeochemical response under different scenarios. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;Biogeochemistry | Coupled models | Lagoon | New Caledonia | Physics;17;0;;;IRD;undefined;Institut de Recherche pour le Développement

It is influenced by both the open ocean and the high island within a meteorological context subject to seasonal, inter-annual and longer term variations. The short-term variability (>1. day) of meteorological, hydrographical and planktonic parameters is illustrated by a 5-month long time series and is linked to local or remote wind, and precipitation. Seasonal and inter-annual variabilities, inferred from a 10-year long station by spectral analysis, appear clearly for all parameters. Seasonality is the main scale of variability as the island lies near the tropic of Capricorn. Inter-annual variability of a 3-4. year periodicity is poorly related to the Southern oscillation index (an equatorial climatic index), stressing the need for a separate tropical index. Long term trends appear on several parameters but their reliability depends on the length of the records. Considering only the longest records (1958-2005), surface temperature appears to have increased since the end of the 1960s in Noumea area. Finally, as a result of greater terrestrial influence, shallower depths, and longer water turnover times close to shore, the temporal variability amplitude decreases from the shore to the barrier reef. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;Coral reef lagoon | Hydrography | Meteorology | Plankton | Temporal variability;27;0;;;;undefined;

This paper synthesizes findings from the 2000-2008 French National Program EC2CO-PNEC relative to the circulation and the transport of suspended particles in this lagoon. Numerical model development (hydrodynamic, fine suspended sediment transport, wind-wave, small-scale atmospheric circulation) allowed the determination of circulation patterns in the lagoon and the charting of residence time, the later of which has been recently used in a series of ecological studies. Topical studies based on field measurements permitted the parameterisation of wave set-up induced by the swell breaking on the reef barrier and the validation of a wind-wave model in a fetch-limited environment. The analysis of spatial and temporal variability of suspended matter concentration over short and long time-scales, the measurement of grain size distribution and the density of suspended matter (1.27kgl-1), and the estimation of erodibility of heterogeneous (sand/mud, terrigenous/biogenic) soft bottoms was also conducted. Aggregates were shown to be more abundant near or around reefs and a possible biological influence on this aggregation is discussed. Optical measurements enabled the quantification of suspended matter either in situ (monochromatic measurements) or remotely (surface spectral measurements and satellite observations) and provided indirect calibration and validation of a suspended sediment transport model. The processes that warrant further investigation in order to improve our knowledge of circulation and suspended sediment transport in the New Caledonia lagoon as well as in other coral reef areas are discussed, as are the relevance and reliability of the numerical models for this endeavour. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;Coral reef lagoon | Hydrodynamics | New Caledonia | Resuspension | Sediment | Suspended sediment | Turbidity;84;0;repositoryvor;Green;NASA;NNG04F090G;National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Three substrates as well as agar were proved: perlite, pumice stone and luffa sponge. Rebutia micropropagated plantlets were transferred to MS halfstrength medium containing 5.37 μM NAA. Roots occurrence was evaluated after 6 weeks in cultivation. Roots were produced rapidly and more vigorous in treatments with luffa sponge and agar. The treatments with perlite and pumice stone behaved less efficiently. No morphological alteration was observed during the plantlet culture in the alternative substrates. It is easy to notice the rooting process in agar, pumice stone and luffa sponge. With the use of perlite this observation becomes difficult and only the roots are visible when they reach the surface of the culture container. Luffa sponge represents an acceptable alternative for in vitro rooting for this species.;Agar | Cactaceae | Luffa sponge | Perlite | Pumice stone | Rebutia muscula;0;0;;;;undefined;

In this work, we studied the effects of sub-acute lead administration on the distribution of NOS isoforms in the hippocampus with respect to blood and hippocampal lead levels. Lead acetate (125, 250 and 500. ppm) was given via drinking water to adult male Wistar rats for 14 days. We determined blood and hippocampal lead levels by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Antibodies against three isoforms of NOS were used to analyze expression and immunolocalization using western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Blood and hippocampal lead levels were increased in a dose-dependent manner in groups treated with lead acetate. We found diminished expression and immunoreactivity of nNOS and eNOS at 500. ppm as compared to the control group. No expression and immunoreactivity was observed in hippocampus for iNOS. The observed high levels of lead in the blood reflect free physiological access to this metal to the organism and were related to diminished expression and immunoreactivity for nNOS and eNOS. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.;Hippocampus | Lead | Neurotoxicity | Nitric oxide | Nitric oxide synthase | Rats;19;0;;;;undefined;

In this study we evaluated the early time-course of toxic events (oxidative damage to lipids, mitochondrial dysfunction and LDH leakage, all at 1, 3 and 6. h) in rat striatal slices exposed to quinolinic acid (QUIN, 100 μM) as an excitotoxic/pro-oxidant model, 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP, 1. mM) as an inhibitor of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase, and a combined model produced by the co-administration of these two toxins at subtoxic concentrations (21 and 166 μM for QUIN and 3-NP, respectively). In order to further characterize a possible causality of caspases or calpains on the toxic mechanisms produced in these models, the broad calpain inhibitor IC1 (50 μM), and the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (100 μM) were tested. Lipid peroxidation (LP) was increased at all times and in all models evaluated. Both IC1 and Z-VAD exerted significant protection against LP in all models and at all times evaluated. Mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) was consistently affected by all toxic models at 3 and 6. h, but was mostly affected by 3-NP and QUIN at 1. h. IC1 differentially protected the slices against 3-NP and QUIN at 1. h and against QUIN at 3. h, while Z-VAD exhibited positive actions against QUIN and 3-NP at all times tested, and against their combination at 3 and 6. h. LDH leakage was enhanced at 1 and 3. h in all toxic models, but this effect was evident only for 3-NP + QUIN and 3-NP at 6. h. IC1 protected against LDH leakage at 1. h in 3-NP + QUIN and 3-NP models, at 3. h in all toxic models, and at 6. h in 3-NP + QUIN and 3-NP models. In turn, Z-VAD protected at 1 and 6. h in all models tested, and at 3. h in the combined and QUIN models. Our results suggest differential chronologic and mechanistic patterns, depending on the toxic insult. Although LP, MD and membrane cell rupture are shared by the three models, the occurrence of each event seems to obey to a selective recruitment of damaging signals, including a differential activation of proteases in time. Proteases activation is likely to be an up-stream event influencing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in these toxic models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;3-nitropropionic acid | Calpains | Caspases | Cell damage | Energy depletion | Neuroprotection | Neurotoxicity | Oxidative stress | Protease inhibitors | Quinolinate;25;0;;;CONACYT;48370-Q;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The cellulose was previously UV-irradiated and then functionalized from an aqueous emulsion of the chitosan with the essential oil. The novel materials are readily attained with durable fragrance and enhanced antimicrobial properties. The incorporation of chitosan as determined from the elemental analyses data was 16.08 ± 0.29 mg/g of sample. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) provided further evidence for the successful attachment of chitosan microcapsules containing the essential oil to the treated cellulose fibers. The materials thus produced displayed 100% inhibition of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis up to 48 h of incubation. Inhibition of bacteria by the essential oil was also evaluated at several concentrations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the association between different polymorphisms frequently found in young patients with cryptogenic stroke [methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, factor II (prothrombin) G20210A, factor V G1691A (Leiden), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) intron 4 VNTR, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) e{open}4 gene] in patients with a cerebral infarct caused by spontaneous cervical artery dissection. Methods:Forty-eight patients (27 males) and 96 matching control subjects were recruited. Clinical history, including cardiovascular risk factors, was assessed in all subjects. Genotypes were determined by a polymerase chain reaction with and without a restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotypes and allele frequencies of the five genetic variants studied were compared between spontaneous cervical artery dissection cases and controls. We also incorporated our data into a meta-analysis of the MTHFR/C677T variant. Results: Of 48 patients with spontaneous cervical artery dissection (28 vertebral and 20 carotid), the mean age of the patients was 36·6 ± SD 9·9 years. There were no significant associations between the alleles of the five genetic polymorphisms studied and spontaneous cervical artery dissection. In the meta-analysis of the MTHFR/C677T variant, a total of 564 individuals (231 cases and 333 controls) were analysed; no significant association was observed. Conclusions:The results from this exploratory case-control study show the lack of an association between MTHFR, factor II G20210A, factor V G1691A, NOS3, intron 4 VNTR, and APOE ε4 gene polymorphisms and the development of spontaneous cervical artery dissection. Our findings contribute towards a better understanding of the genetic risk factors associated with spontaneous cervical artery dissection. © 2010 The Authors.

Although the biological mechanism is unknown, it has been suggested that hyperactivity of platelets may have an important role in the onset and evolution of cardiovascular damage. The goals of this study were to evaluate by transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry the presence of ultra-structural variations in platelets from individuals with recent diagnosis of major depression disease (MDD, patients without previous anti-depressant treatment and from healthy control subjects.). Platelets from depressed patients had a greater proportion of dendritic forms compared with those obtained from control subjects. Morphological changes, such as dilation of open canalicular and dense tubular systems, platelet vacuolization, electrodense pattern of membranes, and a different immunolocalization of P-selectin were observed in the platelets from depressed patients compared with those isolated from healthy subjects. Our results revealed ultra-structural changes in platelets isolated from patients with MDD suggestive of enhanced platelet activation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.;Blood coagulation | Cardiovascular disease | Major depressive disorder | P-selectin | Platelet morphology | Platelets;14;0;;;;undefined;

PM10-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and oxidative damage with no changes in cellular viability. In addition, PM10 decreased glutathione (GSH) levels (54.9%) and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (65%), catalase (31.2%), glutathione reductase (61.5%) and glutathione-S-transferase (42.39%). Trolox, a scavenger of reactive species, prevented the increase of ROS generation and the decrease in GSH levels but partially prevented PM10-induced oxidative damage. Interestingly, it was unable to avoid the decrease in the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Finally, the survival of the cells previously exposed to PM10 and challenged with hydrogen peroxide was significantly lower. We conclude that the impairment in the antioxidant defense system induced by PM10 weaken ROS detoxification which exacerbates cell death when these cells are exposed to an acute oxidative challenge. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, he was also fascinated by baboons' behaviour, according to Brehm's accounts: hamadryas baboons showed a strong altruism to the point of risking their own lives in order to save their infants from attack by dogs. In 1871, he mentions he would rather have descended from brave baboons than from ""savages"", considered egoistic.

It has potential to improve soil fertility and as fodder. Seeds of L. campestris show dormancy, and the technology needed to increase its potential use requires information about conditions favouring seed germination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seed germination response of L. campestris under controlled (laboratory) and natural field conditions. Under laboratory conditions, 2 yr old seeds had a maximum germination percentage (50%) when they were scarified with sulphuric acid for 90 min prior to sowing and when laboratory light (0.5 μmol m-2 s-1) was maintained during the diurnal period. Without scarification, only about 3% of the seeds germinated. Light in laboratory resulted in an increased seed germination as compared to darkness condition. In the field experiment 1 yr old seeds were used testing the following treatments: (a) seed scarification (seeds scarified by 30 min immersion in sulphuric acid vs. not scarified), (b) presence or absence of plants of L. campestris in plots before field experiments, and (c) sowing depth (on soil surface and at 3 cm deep). The scarified seeds showed a germination percentage range between 50 and 64%, whereas non-scarified seeds had 9 to 16% germination. The seeds sowed in plots with or without plants of L. campestris (before the experiment) germinated similarly, indicating no evidence of self-inhibition of germination. Three conclusions come out: (1) Scarification treatment with sulphuric acid effectively breaks dormancy in L. campestris seeds; (2) Direct sowing of scarified seeds (on the soil surface or at 3 cm depth) resulted in a range of 50-64% of germination under field conditions; and (3) no evidence was obtained for self-inhibition or a positive interaction between preceding vegetation and seed germination of L. campestris.";Green manure | Seed dormancy | Sowing depth;5;0;;;;undefined;

This plant is wild-crafted, and conservationists have expressed concerns with regard to the sustainability of production. In the present work, two factors were found to be of importance for the regeneration of M. dealbata and the production of honokiol and magnolol. These factors were the type of explants and the combination and concentration of plant-growth regulators. Green, compact, nodular organogenic callus was obtained from leaf explants in a medium fortified with Murashige and Skoog salts and supplemented with 1.5 mg/L 2,4-dicholorophenoxyacetic acid and 1.5 mg/L kinetin. Shoot multiplication from callus cultures was achieved in the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 1.5 mg/L thidiazuron (TDZ). Phenol secretion was controlled by the addition of 250 mg/L of activated charcoal. For rooting, shoots were transferred to MS medium supplemented with several auxins. After root induction, the plants were hardened in earthen pots containing sand, soil, and vermiculite. The contents of honokiol (HK) and magnolol (MG) were determined in different plant materials by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection techniques. This analysis revealed that the honokiol and magnolol content in aerial and underground parts of micropropagated M. dealbata were higher than that observed in wild plants (both 6 months old). Our results suggest that conservation of M. dealbata is possible by means of in vitro multiplication of leaf-derived callus. The usefulness of M. dealbata regeneration and production of HK and MG may be attributed to the proper selection of explant sourcing and identification of the correct growth medium to support adequate growth. This careful selection of explants and growth medium leads to a very useful source of plant material for pharmacological and phytomedicinal screening applications and, above all, would safeguard this plant species from the threat of extinction.;Callus | Honokiol | Magnolia dealbata Zucc. | Magnolidaceae | Magnolol | Micropropagation;14;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Through the use of multivariate analysis (TWINSPAN and CANOCO) we observed that species composition in the groups is modified in spatial and temporal scales.

We address this issue by examining associations of smoking with subsequent SROs with and without controls for potential explanatory variables in the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) panel. The latter consists of 5001 people who participated in both the 1990-2002 NCS and the 2001-2003 NCS follow-up survey. Explanatory variables include sociodemographics, potential common causes (parental history of mental-substance disorders; other respondent childhood adversities) and potential mediators (respondent history of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edn, revised mental-substance disorders). Small gross (that is, without controls) prospective associations are found between history of early-onset nicotine dependence and both subsequent suicide ideation and, among ideators, subsequent suicide plans. None of the baseline smoking measures, though, predicts subsequent suicide gestures or attempts among ideators. The smoking-ideation association largely disappear, but the association of early-onset nicotine dependence with subsequent suicide plans persists (odds ratio3.0), after adjustment for control variables. However, the latter association is as strong with remitted as active nicotine dependence, arguing against a direct causal effect of nicotine dependence on suicide plans. Decomposition of the control variable effects, furthermore, suggests that these effects are due to common causes more than to mediators. These results refine our understanding of the ways in which smoking is associated with later SROs and for the most part argue against the view that these associations are due to causal effects of smoking. © 2009 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.";Nicotine dependence | Smoking | Suicide | Suicide attempts | Suicide ideation | Tobacco use;63;0;repositoryam;Green;NIMH;R01 DA016558;National Institute of Mental Health

In this study, the effect of refrigerated storage (10 °C) was compared to storage at 20 °C on the volatile chemical profile of the aroma of light red tomato '7705' using GC-MS. Changes in the aroma volatile profile were correlated with a sensory analysis, using the quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) method, and with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme activity. Refrigeration induced changes in levels of 3-methylbutanal, linalool, guiacol, hexanol, trans-2-hexenal and trans-3-hexenol. Some of these alterations may be explained by a decrease in ADH enzyme activity observed in refrigerated tomato. They were reflected in aroma perception as an increase in the descriptors solvent-humidity and medicinal and a decrease in the descriptor lemon tea. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Aim of the study: This study compared the therapeutic effectiveness and tolerability of two concentrations of the standardized extract from Ageratina pichinchensis (12.6 and 16.8%) on patients with clinical and mycological diagnosis of mild and moderate onychomycosis. Materials and methods: Two identical phytopharmaceuticals (containing the standardized extract from Ageratina pichinchensis) in nail lacquer solution for topical administration were evaluated in a double-blind clinical trial. Treatments were administered for 6 months to patients distributed in two groups. Results and discussion: Of 122 patients who agreed to participate in the study, 103 (84.4%) concluded the treatment. The therapeutic effectiveness exhibited by the 12.6% Ageratina pichinchensis extract was 67.2%, while that of the 16.8% Ageratina pichinchensis extract was 79.1%. Regarding clinical evolution, analysis of results at the end of treatment evidenced that the 16.8% concentration possesses higher therapeutic effectiveness with a significant statistical difference (p = 0.010). No treatment produced side effects. Conclusion: Both concentrations of phytopharmaceuticals possess high rates of effectiveness on patients with mild and moderate onychomycosis, and the formulation with a 16.8% concentration possesses higher effectiveness. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The metabolism of the bacterium under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions was studied by 13C-NMR. 13C-labelled poly-βhydroxybutyrate (PHB) formation occurred in cell suspensions incubated with 13C-labelled methane at low (5-10%) oxygen concentration. Under these conditions low levels of succinate, acetate and 2,3-butanediol were formed and excreted into the culture medium. Intracellular PHB degradation was observed in intact cells under anaerobic conditions in the absence of an exogenous carbon source during a long-term incubation of 90 days. Multiple 13C-labelled β-hydroxybutyrate, butyrate, acetate, acetone, isopropanol, 2,3-butanediol and succinate were identified as products in in vivo 13C-NMR spectra and in the spectra of culture medium during the dynamic PHB degradation. The isolated obligate methanotroph clearly shows a fermentative metabolism of PHB under anaerobic conditions.

Design: Seven-year-old school children (53 boys and 57 girls) were recruited to measure their SSFR in mL/min. Paraffin-stimulated saliva was collected from each child at baseline and once annually, over six years. Forty-four boys and 46 girls remained in the cohort (dropout rate 18%). Cluster analysis was applied to evaluate the natural grouping of individuals according to their SSFR. Partition analysis was applied to calculate the SSFR cut-off value to predict a child's salivation trend. Results: Cluster analysis revealed that as they grew-up these children consistently showed one of three different SSFR patterns. The cut-off values to predict a child's salivation trend were 1.76 mL/min for the high SSFR cluster, and 0.5 mL/min for the low SSFR cluster. Conclusions: These findings indicate that a high or low SSFR is a constant individual trait in children. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

One strategy is to combine olanzapine plus antidepressant drugs. In preclinical studies in male rats, olanzapine combined with fluoxetine produce antidepressant-like actions and increase the allopregnanolone levels in the brain. 17-β estradiol also produces antidepressant-like actions by increasing allopregnanolone levels. However, the effects of combining olanzapine with 17-β estradiol in the forced swimming test have not been tested before. Thus, systemic injections of vehicle plus olanzapine, or fluoxetine (20.0 mg/kg; 25.0 mg/kg) or 17-β estradiol (10.0 μg/rat; 20.0 μg/rat) reduced immobility by increasing active behaviors, which were cancelled by finasteride (finasteride was used to block the endogenous production of allopregnanolone by the brain) in ovariectomized rats forced to swim. Subthreshold doses of olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg) combined with subthreshold doses of 17-β estradiol (5.0 μg/rat) produced antidepressant-like actions, as did the combination subthreshold dose of olanzapine (2.5 mg/kg) plus the subthreshold dose of fluoxetine (15.0 mg/kg). Finasteride cancelled the antidepressant-like actions of the several combinations used. It is concluded that olanzapine alone or combined with fluoxetine or estradiol reduced immobility by increasing swimming. In conclusion, olanzapine produces antidepressant-like actions alone or in combination with estradiol. These antidepressant-like actions of this combination were cancelled by finasteride. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Heterologous expression has also been achieved in some non-producing peroxidase ascomycetes, like Penicillium and Aspergillus. In this work, heterologous expression of peroxidase-encoding genes, lignin peroxidase, and manganese peroxidase was achieved in a zygomycete producing only phenoloxidases (Amylomyces rouxii), aimed at coupling two different pathways used in nature for PCP removal in only one microbial strain.

We analyze the dispersal of maize transgenes via seeds in Mexico, the crop's cradle. Methods: We use immunoassays (ELISA) to screen for the activity of recombinant proteins in a nationwide sample of farmer seed stocks. We estimate critical parameters of seed population dynamics using household survey data and combine these estimates with analytical results to examine presumed sources and mechanisms of dispersal. Results: Recombinant proteins Cry1Ab/Ac and CP4/EPSPS were found in 3.1% and 1.8% of samples, respectively. They are most abundant in southeast Mexico but also present in the west-central region. Diffusion of seed and grain imported from the United States might explain the frequency and distribution of transgenes in west-central Mexico but not in the southeast. Conclusions: Understanding the potential for transgene survival and dispersal should help design methods to regulate the diffusion of germplasm into local seed stocks. Further research is needed on the interactions between formal and informal seed systems and grain markets in centers of crop origin and diversification. © 2009 Dyer et al.;;59;1;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) content as well as stable carbon isotopic composition of OC (δ13COC) were analysed in 19 surface sediments to determine the distribution and sources of organic matter in the Rhône delta system. Large spatial variations were observed in both the total O2 uptake (5.2 to 29.3 mmol m-2 d-1) and NH4+ release (-0.1 to -3.5 mmol m-2 d-1) rates at the sediment-water interface. The highest fluxes were measured near the Rhône River mouth where sedimentary OC and TN contents reached 1.81% and 0.23% respectively. Values of δ13COC ranged from -26.83‰ to -23.88‰ with a significant seawards enrichment tracing the dispersal of terrestrial organic matter on the continental shelf. The amount of terrestrial-derived OC reaches 85% in sediments close to the Rhône mouth decreasing down to 25% in continental shelf sediments. On the prodelta, high terrestrial OC accumulation rates support high oxygen uptake rates and thus indicating that a significant fraction of terrestrial OC is remineralized. A particulate organic carbon (POC) mass balance indicates that only 3% of the deposited POC is remineralized in prodelta sediments while 96% is recycled on the continental shelf. It was calculated that a large proportion of the Rhône POC input is either buried (∼52%) or remineralized (∼8%), mostly on the prodelta area. The remaining fraction (∼40%) is either mineralized in the water or exported outside the Rhône delta system in dissolved or particulate forms. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Method: Twenty three untreated patients were studied and compared with a matched control group. Diagnosis of narcolepsy was carried out employing a clinical interview, a polysomnographic (PSG) record, and an MSLT. Results: Subjective number of awakenings was the SSQ indicator that best correlated with EDS (ESS and MSLT). Regarding clinical features, diurnal tiredness and sleep paralysis correlated with ESS values. Increase in ESS was related with decrease in total sleep time, SWS, and sleep onset latency. On the other hand, increase in MSLT was related with decrease in SWS. Conclusion: These data suggest that EDS in patients with narcolepsy could be impaired by disturbed nocturnal sleep.;Clinical symptoms | Epworth sleepiness scale | Excessive daytime sleepiness | Multiple sleep latency test | Narcolepsy | Sleep architecture | Subjective sleep quality;16;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

Two strains of Rhizopus sp. (19 and 43a) produced biocatalysts (L-19 and L-43a) that showed high lipase activities (74 and 72 U/g of dry matter, respectively) comparable to Lipozyme® RM IM (118 U/g DM). The use of the dipole moment of the organic solvents along with their classification based on the functional groups (non-polar, protic polar, aprotic polar) allowed the establishment of four different relative activity profiles for the seven biocatalysts evaluated. Compared to a biocatalyst not exposed to the organic solvent (100% relative activity), all biocatalysts showed a high relative activity (greater than 90%) in aprotic polar solvents (acetonitrile, acetone and ethyl acetate), whereas in protic polar solvents (ethanol and i-propanol) activity was reduced (lower than 40%). In addition, the incubation of biocatalysts L-19 and L-43a in i-amyl alcohol increased lipase activity in the synthesis of ethyl oleate 3.36 and 1.46 times, respectively. L-19 activity also increased after incubation in toluene (2.0 times), i-propanol (1.5 times) and acetonitrile (1.3 times) at temperatures from 30 to 50 °C. The results suggest that these biocatalysts can be used for a broad range of lipase reactions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Steud. was carried out using six trees collected during the rainy and dry seasons In a dry forest from Veracruz, México. Stem segments were cut at 1,30 m above the ground for obtaining wood samples for macroscopic and microscopic observations, and for the water content and specific gravity analyses. Following classical microtechnique procedures and international classifications and nomenclatures for describing microscopic features, wood samples and permanent slides of wood sections and dissociated material were made. Estimations of vulnerability and collapse indexes, and Kh-theoretical were made from vessel diameter, vessel number and effective vessel area. Analysis of variance and principal components analysis showed that some fiber, vessels, rays and pit features influenced differences among trees, sites and seasons. Although variability of those features Is relatively low, it would explain the sapwood and heartwood stability during changes in the hydric regime caused by dryness and rain. Collapse and vulnerability indexes, as well as Kh, show a mesomorphic xylem quite vulnerable to embolisms, but with high success to develop in disturbed environments. This could be explained by the presence of tyloses, abundant axial parenchyma and high values of specific gravity that assure resistance of fiber and vessel cell walls to collapse.;Moisture content | Specific gravity | Wood anatomy;6;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

However, previous studies have reported poor reliability (repeatability) of HRV measures in children at rest and during light exercise. Whether the reliability can be improved by controlling variables such as physical activity, breathing rate and tidal volume, or by selecting non-conventional techniques for analysing the data remains as an open question. We evaluated the short-term repeatability of RR-interval data from medicated children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH). The α1 exponents, obtained by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), from the data of 21 children collected at two different sessions were compared. Elapsed days between sessions were 59 33, and data were obtained during 10 min, trying to restrict the children's activity while being seated. We found statistical agreement between the means of α1 exponents for each session (p = 0.94) and no bias with a low-coefficient variation (9.1%); an intraclass correlation coefficient ri = 0.48 ([0.14 0.72], 95% confidence interval) was also estimated. These findings, which were compared with results obtained by conventional time and frequency techniques, indicate the existence of agreement between the α1 exponents obtained at each session, thereby providing support concerning the repeatability of HRV data as analysed by DFA in children with congenital hypothyroidism. Of particular interest was also the agreement found by using the central frequency of the high-frequency band and the parameter pNN20, both showing better or similar ri than α1 (0.77 [0.57 0.89] and 0.51 [0.17 0.74], respectively), yet considerably better repeatability than other conventional time and frequency parameters. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.";Interchangeability | Intraclass correlation | RR dynamics | Scaling exponent;4;0;;;;undefined;

Topographic profiles were measured every 15 days using a total station during low spring tides. The sediment samples were analyzed by the method of moments and their textural parameters (mean, asymmetry, sorting, and kurtosis) calculated. The textural analysis showed that the sediment in section FV during the study period was moderately well classified and extremely leptokurtic, whereas section HV had two sediment groups: fine sands near the breaker zone and very fine pebbles at the berm; however, the winter period was evident in both sections.

This ropy strain increased cheese yield; nevertheless, with 12.5 TSM the increment was higher than with 17.5 TSM. Analysis of cheese composition showed that with 12.5 TSM, the ropy strain increased moisture, but did not change the fat or non fat solids on dry weight basis (dwb), suggesting that the increment of the yield is only due to water retention. In 17.5 TSM cheeses the ropy strain caused an increase in the moisture and fat (dwb), suggesting that besides water retention, fat also contributed to the yield. The difference in yield increment could be explained by cheese composition: higher fat content creates a more hydrophobic environment, which would expel more water than the cheese with lower fat content. Electron microscopy showed EPS attached to the protein matrix of the cheeses. In 17.5 TSM cheeses EPS was observed around the milk fat globules (MFG), confirming that higher TSM causes EPS to bind the MFG besides binding the protein matrix, retaining fat within the cheese.

Particularly interesting are 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors, which are localized in brain areas involved in memory formation. Interestingly, recently selective 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptor agonists and antagonists have become available. Previous evidence indicates that 5-HT6 or 5-HT7 receptors antagonists had no effects, improved memory formation and/or reversed amnesia. Herein, the effects of EMD (a 5-HT6 receptor agonist) and AS19 (a 5-HT7 receptor agonist) in the associative learning task of autoshaping were studied. Post-training systemic administration of EMD (1-10 mg/kg) or AS19 (1-10 mg/kg) were tested in short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). Results showed that only EMD 5.0 mg/kg impaired both STM and LTM. AS19 at 1-10 mg/kg significantly impaired STM but not LTM. In those groups used to test only LTM, EMD impaired it; while AS19 improved LTM. Moreover, in the interaction experiments, the STM EMD-impairment effect was partially reversed by the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB-399885 (10 mg/kg). The STM AS19-impairment effect (5.0 mg/kg) was not altered by the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg) but reversed by the selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-269970 (10.0 mg/kg). The AS19-SB-269970 combination impaired LTM. Taken together these data suggest that the stimulation of 5-HT6 impaired both STM and LTM. 5-HT7 receptors stimulation impaired STM but improved LTM. And these results are discussed in the context of their possible neural bases. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.";5-HT receptors | Autoshaping | Memory | Rat;57;0;;;;undefined;

Fifteen of the animals received a supplement (SG) during 45 days with molasses-urea mixture (2 kg molasses + 407 g urea/head/day), plus 10 g of ruminally protected methionine. The other sixteen heifers did not receive supplement (CG). Fecal and pastures samples were collected to assess dry herbage intake and digestibility. Serial ultrasound measurements from the ovary were performed in both groups to evaluate follicular dynamics. The heifers were categorized according to their follicular size and presence of a CL. Forage intake and dry matter digestibility were reduced (P < 0.05) and body condition tended to improve (P = 0.07) in the supplemented heifers, however, total intake, final weight, daily gain and dorsal back fat were not affected. After the supplementation period, the percentage of females in the categories < 3 mm and 3 to < 6 mm, was greater (P < 0.05) in CG (25% and 43.7%) that in SG (0% and 26.6%) but in the follicle category of ≥ 9 mm, the percentage of animals was 60% in SG and 18.8% in CG (P < 0.05).

Previously it has been reported that administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in MDD patients modify cortisol and cytokine levels but these studies only evaluated changes over a short time period. This work reports the long-term effects of administration of SSRI on the cortisol levels and pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokine profile in a group of MDD patients treated for 52 weeks. A total of 31 patients diagnosed with MDD received anti depressant treatment with SSRI. HDRS and BDI were administered over a year, and levels of interleukin IL-1β, IL-10, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13, and 24-h urine cortisol were determined at weeks (W) 0, 5, 20, 36 and 52 of treatment. Before treatment we found high levels of cortisol, IL-4, IL-13 (Th2) and IL-10 in MDD patients when compared with healthy volunteers. At W20 psychiatric scales indicated a remission of the depressive episode concomitantly with increments in IL-2 and IL-1β but without changes in cortisol. Towards the end of the treatment (W52) we observed a significant reduction (p < 0.01) in cortisol levels, with an increment in IL-1β and IFN-γ and a decrease in Th2 cytokines.

In the present research a new transfection promoter agent for a non viral expression vector was used, using as a model a plasmid expressing the gene that codifies for the G glycoprotein of the rabies virus. The objective was to evaluate the ability of AL27 to increase the rabies plasmid transfection in in vitro and in vivo conditions. The AL27 fraction was isolated from the venom of Agkistrodon piscivorus by HPLC-RP. AL27 maintained its recognition by sialic acid receptors up to a titer of 64 HU. The pC38 plasmid was selected from a panel of 18 clones constructed by inserting the gene that codifies for glycoprotein G of rabies strain HQIMSS99 into the commercial pCI-neo expression vector. In vitro results showed that pC38, with or without AL27, transfected CHO cells under the calcium-phosphate system and using Confocal Microscopy (CM) increased fluorescence (+++) was observed with the mixture pC38/AL27, than with pC38 alone (++). Flow cytometry (FC) revealed expression percentages of 27.78 and 38.66% for pC38 and pC38/AL27, respectively. The in vivo experiment was performed using three groups of BALB/C mice: group 1 was inoculated with pC38 in the tibial muscle; group 2 with pC38 and AL27 and group 3, negative control, with only PBS. Tissues showed the highest expression by CM (+++) when using pC38/AL27. Antibodies detected ranged from 0.75-1.2 international units (IU) mL-1 for pC38 and from 1.1-1.27 IU mL -1 for pC38/AL27. Results showed that AL27 promoted cell entrance mechanisms, generating a better expression level of the gene that codifies for the G glycoprotein of the rabies virus and consequently enhancing the stimulation of the immune response. © Medwell Journals, 2008.";Agkistrodon piscivorus | Hemoagglutinins | Lectins | Plasmids;0;0;;;;undefined;

Onychomycosis, also known as tinea of the nails or tinea unguium, constitutes an infection of the nails produced by dermatophytes. Clinically, onychomycosis is manifested by changes on the color, texture and thickness of the nail. The agent most frequently found in this disease is Tricophyton rubrum. The present study evaluated the therapeutic effectiveness and tolerability of topical administration of A. pichinchensis extract on the nails of patients with the clinical and mycological diagnosis of onychomycosis. A phytopharmaceutical formulation was developed in a lacquer solution containing the standardized (encecalin) extract of A. pichinchensis. A similar lacquer solution containing 8% ciclopirox was used as control. Treatments were assigned randomly and administered topically for 6 months. Ninety six patients concluded the study (49 in the experimental group and 47 in the control); 71.1 % of patients from the experimental and 80.9% from the control group showed therapeutic effectiveness, while 59.1% and 63.8% from the experimental and control group, respectively, achieved mycological effectiveness. Therapeutic success was observed in 55.1 and 63.8 %, respectively. No patient exhibited intense side effects.

'Jewel' fruit treated with CO2 accumulated acetaldehyde and ethanol but little EA, while 'Cavendish' accumulated little acetaldehyde or ethanol but accumulated EA. In CO 2-treated fruit, PDC activity was positively correlated with EA accumulation in 'Jewel' but not in 'Cavendish', while no differential effect of atmosphere was observed on its gene expression. ADH activity and gene expression show a correlation with ethanol accumulation in 'Cavendish'. In 'Jewel', there was a positive correlation between ADH gene expression and enzyme activity; however, this correlation does not explain ethanol accumulation in this cultivar. EA accumulation did not show any correlation with AAT activity and gene expression in any of the cultivars. Succinate concentrations were highest and those of malate lowest in CO2-treated fruit of both cultivars, but MDH and ME activities were not affected by CO2. Gene expression of MDH and ME were not affected by atmosphere in 'Cavendish', although in 'Jewel' the MDH expression was slightly lower in CO2- than air-treated fruit.

Syndecan-1 is a cell surface proteoglycan that binds cells to the extracellular matrix and its expression is down-regulated in many cellular transformation models. The aims of this study were to examine the pattern of syndecan-1 expression, to evaluate the proliferating activity in a large series of solid/multicystic (SA) and unicystic ameloblastomas (UA), and to study its possible correlation to their biological behavior. Immunohistochemical studies were performed for syndecan-1 (clone MI15) and Ki-67 (clone MIB-1) in 120 ameloblastomas (75 SA and 45 UA). The salient finding was that expression of syndecan-1 was related to the histological subtype of tumors, as there was a lower expression in SA (40.2%) as compared to UA (49.7%) (p < 0.05). These findings did not correlate with Ki-67 expression, as this was similar in both types of ameloblastomas. Our results suggest that the reduced expression of syndecan-1 supports the view that SA has a more aggressive biological behavior than the UA. The lack of correlation between reduction of the syndecan-1 and Ki-67 index may be due to the different histomorphologies of both types of ameloblastoma, and more studies are necessary to better understand the role of this protein in the biological behavior of these tumors. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The possible pathogenic role of DcR3 in SLE was also assessed. Serum DcR3 levels of 90 SLE patients, 11 patients with rheumatic conditions and 123 healthy controls were determined by ELISA. In all, 43% of the SLE patients, 9% of patients with rheumatic conditions and 2.4% of the normal healthy individuals presented elevated serum DcR3 levels. A higher percentage of DcR3-positive SLE patients, compared with DcR3-negative SLE patients, showed abnormally high serum IgE levels, a surrogate marker of Th2-type immune responses. To determine the cause and effect relationship of DcR3 expression and a Th2-prone status, we studied young DcR3 transgenic (Tg) mice, whose transgene was driven by an actin promoter. These mice had IL-4 overproduction and augmented serum IgE levels, signs of dominant Th2 immune responses. To determine possible SLE pathogenic roles of DcR3, the T-cell-depleted bone marrow of DcR3 Tg mice was transplanted into lethally irradiated syngeneic C57BL/6 female mice. The recipients developed an SLE-like syndrome. They presented anti-dsDNA and anti-nuclear antibodies, along with renal and liver pathology compatible with that of SLE. In total, 90% of Tg bone marrow-transplanted mice, compared with 20% of wild-type bone marrow-transplanted mice, perished within 12 months after the transplantation. Our results showed that serum DcR3 could serve as an additional parameter for SLE diagnosis and that DcR3 secreted from cells of hematopoietic origin was SLE pathogenic in mice. © The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2008.

We have recently shown that adult nulliparous and multiparous hamster females show significant asynchrony and retard on early embryo development (from two blastomeres to morula stages) when compared with nulliparous young females. The number of cell-cell adhesions between blastomeres in early embryo development has been reported to be a good indication of the ability of embryos to cleave and develop. In this work we studied, by indirect immunofluorescence, the presence and distribution of E-cadherin in 4-cell embryos obtained from nulliparous young (NYF), nulliparous adult (NAF) and multiparous adult (MAF) hamster females. Distribution and intensity of fluorescence was observed and registered using confocal microscopy. Staining intensities for E-cadherin were quantified by computed densitometry in the free membrane regions, in the cytoplasm region and in the cell-cell adhesion zones of each embryo. E-Cadherin in all the studied zones was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in NYF. Cadherin concentration in the intercellular membranes was always statistically higher (p < 0.05) than in the free membrane regions. An appreciable concentration of E-cadherin was found in the cytoplasm of the 4-cell embryos obtained from the three groups of females, but was significantly higher in NYF. No statistical differences were observed in any of the parameters studied between NAF and MAF. Our results seem to indicate that changes in the reproductive behavior related to age and/or multiparity may be correlated with changes in the processes related to intercellular adhesions during early cleavage. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.;Compaction | E-cadherin | Embryo development | Hamster;2;0;;;;undefined;

In large part, this occurs with the help and participation of the technical process, which is often not considered as an educational matter for patients and their families, permitting the persistence of doubts, reflections and inadequate conclusions regarding professional procedures. The professional activity must consider, health education for patients with as a benchmark that would guide to the handling of some of their health problems, the healthy functioning of their body in order to help to reach a good care of the social health of the community. The word vice and its moral connotations, having already permeated social education on health, is threatening and requires prompt and forced solution to avoid that the patient mentally ill and/or abuser addicted be considered as a bad person and no longer a patient: it is then a vicious person, not worthy of respect and attention, but worthy of punishment.

Medium molecular weight (MW) chitosans displayed higher inhibitory activity against the yeast than low MW biopolymers. Chitosans with low degree of acetylation (DA) were inhibitory for yeast and mould. Therefore, a low MW and high DA chitosan was selected for use against moulds combined with yeasts.

The genus Desmoncus (subfamily Arecoideae, subtribe Bactridinae) is distributed throughout the Americas, from veracruz, Mexico, to Brazil and Bolivia. The anatomical characteristics of its support tissue have not been thoroughly studied, although some observations from Central American artisans suggest that the stems collected from undisturbed sites possess better characteristics; these include a good capacity to withstand bending without breaking (i.e. higher fracture strength than plants from disturbed sites). Stem samples were collected from individuals from disturbed and undisturbed sites, at three points along the length of the stem (basal, medium and apical). Collections were made of one ramet from five individuals (n=5) at both sites. Each ramet was divided into three sections: basal, from soil surface to a height of 0.5 m; medium, from a height of 0.5 to 5.0 m; and apical, from a height 5.0 to 10.0 m. An anatomical analysis including vascular bundles, parenchyma elements and fibers was performed in the radial direction and also along the longitudinal direction of the stems. The amount of vascular bundles was greater for samples from undisturbed site stems; the amount of parenchyma cells differ between samples from both sites and the amount of fibers was greater for samples from disturbed site stems. The anatomical structural dimensions were smaller for samples from the undisturbed site stems. These findings partially confirm the artisans' belief and supports the conclusion that microclimatic conditions affect plant anatomical structure.";Climbing palms | Desmoncus orthacanthos | Growth conditions | Stem anatomy;6;0;;;;undefined;

Laboratory animals have been very useful in studying the effects of varying levels of malnutrition because non-nutritional factors that affect humans may be controlled. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of moderate and severe malnutrition on lymphocyte proportions and activation markers of T cells in experimentally malnourished rats during lactation by flow cytometry. Lower absolute (total) and relative (%) numbers of CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocyte subpopulations were observed in moderately (second degree) and severely (third degree) malnourished rats compared with well-nourished rats (P < 0.05). Both groups of malnourished rats showed a significant decrease in the percentage of CD71 + cells at 24 h post-activation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). After 24 h activation of spleen cells with PHA, a lower percentage of CD25 + cells was observed in malnourished than well-nourished rats (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of this study indicated an altered expression of CD71 and CD25 during activation of T lymphocytes in malnourished rats and may partially explain increased susceptibility to infection associated with malnutrition. Moreover, these results demonstrated that moderate malnutrition affects the response of T lymphocytes as much as severe malnutrition. © 2008 The Author(s).;CD25 | CD71 | Flow cytometry | Lymphocyte activation | Malnutrition;24;0;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

The leaves were collected from plants at the young (ca. 12 years old), bud (ca. 14 years old) and mature (ca. 16 years old) stages of growth. The CP level of young Agave (48 g/kg DM) leaves was higher than in leaves from the bud (38 g/kg DM) and mature (43 g/kg DM) stages, and higher in the upper (51 g/kg DM) than in the lower (35 g/kg DM) leaf sections. The leaves at the bud stage contained lower NDF (189 g/kg DM) but higher SC (358 g/kg DM) levels than those of mature (272 g NDF, 247 g SC/kg DM) and young (273 g NDF, 189 g SC) plants. The saponin content of leaves was higher in the mature (11.1 g/kg DM) than in the bud stage (7.5 g/kg DM). In the second study the chemical composition of whole leaves from young, bud and mature micro-ensilaged (3.5 kg as fed) Agave was determined over a 36 weeks fermentation period. Agave silage had acceptable chemical characteristics. As time of fermentation increased, a linear decrease in DM and saponin concentration, a linear increase in NDF and lactic acid levels and a quadratic increase of pH values and ammonia-N concentrations were recorded. Both fresh and ensilaged leaves of the mature and the bud stages were the most desirable maturity stages of Agave to be utilised as feed for ruminants. © South African Society for Animal Science.;Agave salmiana | Chemical composition | Maguey;18;0;;;;undefined;

These cooperative pathways share one common aspect: triggering of oxidative stress by free radical formation. In this work, we evaluated the effects of the antioxidant and energy precursor, levocarnitine (l-CAR), on the oxidative damage and the behavioral, morphological, and neurochemical alterations produced in nerve tissue by the excitotoxin and free radical precursor, quinolinic acid (2,3-pyrindin dicarboxylic acid; QUIN), and the mitochondrial toxin, 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP). Oxidative damage was assessed by the estimation of reactive oxygen species formation, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in synaptosomal fractions. Behavioral, morphological, and neurochemical alterations were evaluated as markers of neurotoxicity in animals systemically administered with l-CAR, chronically injected with 3-NP and/or intrastriatally infused with QUIN. At micromolar concentrations, l-CAR reduced the three markers of oxidative stress stimulated by both toxins alone or in combination. l-CAR also prevented the rotation behavior evoked by QUIN and the hypokinetic pattern induced by 3-NP in rats. Morphological alterations produced by both toxins (increased striatal glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactivity for QUIN and enhanced neuronal damage in different brain regions for 3-NP) were reduced by l-CAR. In addition, l-CAR prevented the synergistic action of 3-NP and QUIN to increase motor asymmetry and depleted striatal GABA levels. Our results suggest that the protective properties of l-CAR in the neurotoxic models tested are mostly mediated by its characteristics as an antioxidant agent. © 2008 The Authors.";3-nitropropionic acid | Energy metabolism deficit | Excitotoxicity | L-carnitine | Neuroprotection | Quinolinic acid;94;0;;;;undefined;

Several scales have been developed in an attempt to specifically detect some of the major aspects of depression, i.e. anhedonia, sadness, hopelessness. On the other hand, in adults depression frequently induces changes in sleep patterns, particularly a shortening in REM sleep latency. The alteration of sleep patterns in depressed children has been a matter of controversy. It is possible that a diagnostic deficiency might be the source of the contradictory reports. In the present study, The Child Depression Inventory, a rating scale specifically developed for child depression was applied to 396 school children (8-12 years of age). Nearly 15% of the children (N=45) obtained scores higher than the established limit in this test for normal healthy subjects. A sample of children found within the highest (N=25) and within the lowest (N=25) scores in the scale were selected. After a clinical evaluation, only those who meet the inclusion criteria (N=21 for depressed and N=7 for healthy controls) were electroencephalographically recorded. Children with depressive symptoms showed a significant shortening in REM sleep latency (mean=108 min) when compared to non-depressed (mean=150 min). In addition, significant increases were observed in sleep latency, REM sleep duration and the number of awakenings. Furthermore, results showed an unexpected high frequency of EEG abnormalities in children with depressive symptoms (75%) characterized by sharp waves and polyspikes in the frontal region. The present results support the notion that depression, in children, is accompanied by changes in sleep patterns, mainly concerning REM sleep.;Child depression | Depression Inventory | EEG abnormalities | Hopelessness Scale | REM sleep;22;0;;;CONACYT;32417;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Odoriferous volatiles interacting with sugars and organic acids provide the typical flavor of tomato. Several reports indicate that in many fruit types the first quality attribute lost during cold storage is flavor. Thus, consumer complaints about lack of tomato flavor are frequent. The present work evaluated the effect of 100C, the commercial cold storage temperature recommended for ripe tomatoes, on the chemical aroma profile of a tomato hybrid with good flavor grown in the state of Morelos, Mexico.

In this paper our approach is to consider the entire parasite community as a biological indicator of the fish environmental conditions. Seven fish species belonging to the Apogonidae, Apogon bandanensis, A. cookii, A. doderleini, A. norfolkensis, A. trimaculatus, Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus and Fowleria variegata, were sampled on six stations in two bays (Grand-Rade and Sainte-Marie) around Nouméa (New-Caledonia). The two bays are submitted to urban wastewater inputs alone or combined with additional industrial inputs which influences decrease from the inner part to the entrance of each bay. A total of 592 fish were dissected for macro parasite examination. Parasites were grouped according to their taxonomical rank and development stage for the analysis. We found an inconsistent effect of the confinement between the two bays, revealing that the parasite community is not the same in the two bays. Moreover, the encysted metacercariae found in the pericardic cavity were found to be significant indicators of the specific anthropogenically impacted environmental conditions prevailing in the inner parts of the two bays. Other parasite taxa were found to be significant indicators of specific environmental conditions in one or two stations among the six sampled. Results on parasite specificity and biological life cycle of the parasite taxa found in sampled Apogonid were further compared with environmental parameters. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

During adolescence these opportunities increase. Because of the scarcity of data for the Mexican population, the aim is to estimate the prevalence of drug use opportunities among Mexican adolescents, the prevalence of drug use among those who were presented with the opportunity, and the socio-demographic correlates of both. A multistage probability survey was carried out among 12-17 year olds from Mexico City. Adolescents were administered the adolescent version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The response rate was 71% (n = 3005). Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were performed considering the multistage and weighted sample design. Twenty-nine percent has had the opportunity to try illicit drugs; of those presented with an opportunity, 18% has done so. Males, older adolescents, school drop-outs, and those whose parent has had drug problems are more likely to have been exposed to drug use opportunities while more religious adolescents are less likely. Given the chance to try drugs, older adolescents and school drop-outs are more likely to do so and those with high parental monitoring and religiosity are less likely. These results suggest that less substance use among females in Mexico may be due in part to fewer opportunities to use since females were equally likely to use drugs given the opportunity. Given the increase in opportunity among older adolescents, preventive efforts should start by age 12 and with special attention to adolescents who have dropped out of school. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Plant ages were 1.5-3.5 years (class 1), 3.6-5.5 years (class 2) and 5.6-7.5 years (class 3). Soil samples were taken at two soil depths (0-20 and 21-40 cm) from plots of 4000 m2 within each site and plant age classes, during the spring of 2005. The main changes in soil properties were found in the mountain site. Soil bulk density (2.0 g cm-3), cone penetration resistance (CPR) (3.96 MPa), 0.7 and 1.0 mm water stable aggregates (WSA) (28.3 g kg-1 and 102.2 g kg-1, respectively) were higher in the mountain site than in the hill and valley fields. This result is consistent with the rocky substrate beneath the shallow soil. Soil organic carbon (SOC) (23.9 g kg-1), available N (23.1 mg kg-1) and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) (969.6 μg g-1) at the mountain site showed the highest values, suggesting that MT practiced in this topographic condition favours the organic matter accumulation and biological activity. Soil microbial biomass carbon and SOC seem to be the soil properties that were mainly affected by the sites and soil management associated with them. For the three sites, SOC, POlsen, available N, exchangeable Na+ and SMBC were higher at 0-20 cm depth than at 21-40 cm depth within each site. Exchangeable Ca2+ and K+, POlsen and CPR increased with plant age. In contrast, available N decreased. Soil chemical properties were more affected by the age of the plant than physical and biological properties. Results reported here represent a reference of the fertility properties of soils cultivated with A. angustifolia, which could be used in further studies focused on management and tillage systems. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Poiret (Leguminoseae) tree, known as tepescohuite in Mexico, is commonly used in this country and in Central America to elaborate different products for the treatment of skin burns and lesions. The cicatrizing properties of extracts obtained from this bark have been scientifically studied, attributing the main biological activity to its tannin and saponin content. Studies include clinical trials of phytodrugs based on Mimosae tenuiflora bark extracts for treatment of venous leg ulcerations. Recent commercialization of the plant drug Mimosae tenuiflorae cortex requires pharmacognostical information to develop quality-control methods for raw materials and extracts produced with this plant drug. The present paper reports a group of ethnobotanical, morphological, chemical, and molecular studies performed with Mimosae tenuiflora materials obtained by collection in the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas. Macro- and micro-morphological parameters were established to authenticate the genuine drug that allowed detection of adulterants usually found in commercial samples of this plant material. These morphological characteristics can be used for rapid identification of the drug and are particularly useful in the case of powdered materials. The chemical studies performed demonstrated that tannins represent the major component group in the bark. Its content in genuine tepescohuite is 16% and is mainly composed of proanthocyanidins, a condition permitting a tannin-based chemical-control method for fingerprinting the plant drug. Contrariwise, the saponin concentration in Mimosae tenuiflora bark is extremely low, and its isolation and content evaluation represent a complex procedure that is unsuitable for routine control purposes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal response of the soil macroorganic fraction to different organic coffee farming practices (e.g., plant residue, earthworm and microbial inocula addition). Three density fractions of macroorganic matter (> 150 μm) were studied during 1 year after adding shade tree (Erythrina poeppigiana) pruning residues to the soil (5 t ha- 1 twice at 6 monthly intervals). Soil macroorganic matter represented only a small proportion of total soil organic matter (SOM) (3-6% of total). Even though the total amount of SOM did not change over time, significant temporal changes in the size of the macroorganic fraction were observed that appeared to be largely independent of the management regime. The light density fraction seemed to be the most responsive fraction and this study suggests that it may provide a qualitative indicator of the 'active' fraction of SOM; the size of the macroorganic fraction did not provide a reliable indicator of the rate of litter decomposition or nutrient release. The addition of microbial inoculants and earthworms had only a small and inconsistent effect on macroorganic matter dynamics and these practices appeared to offer little agronomic benefit. This study highlights the need for continued organic matter inputs to maintain soil C reserves and preserve soil organic quality in tropical organic farming systems. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Patients with locally confined PC are treated with either radiotherapy or surgery. However, treatment of more advanced stages of the disease is problematic. Initially, androgen deprivation offers a period of clinical stability, which is however invariably followed by progression to non-responsiveness to hormonal manipulation. Current management of patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) displays modest response rates and achieves only short-term benefit. Recently, knowledge in the complex pathophysiology of advanced PC has led to the identification of mechanisms and target molecules permitting the introduction of new therapies. Consequently, many investigational treatments are ongoing for AIPC in Phase-II and Phase-III trials aiming at the combination of chemotherapeutic regimens along with immunotherapy targeting PC-associated antigens. Other attractive options are gene therapy, as well as the targeting of survival signaling, differentiation, and apoptosis of the malignant PC cells. Further treatment modalities are directed against the tumor microenvironment, bone metastasis, or both. Collectively, the aforementioned efforts introduce a new era in the management of advanced PC. Novel pharmaceutical compounds and innovative approaches, integrated into the concept of individualized therapy will hopefully, during the next decade, improve the outcome and survival for hundreds of thousands of men worldwide. © Humana Press Inc. 2007.;Advanced-stages | Molecular therapy | Prostate cancer;14;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

It included seven physiochemical determinations for the Water Quality Index (WQI), an Extended Biotic Index (EBI) based on the macrobenthos communities and the application of bioassays on sorghum seeds. The results indicated that according to the levels of the WQI there was a big difference between the river and the lake; during the dry season, the river figures in the scale of polluted to highly polluted, including its entrance to Chapala Lake, the rest of the lake was placed within the interval between low pollution and acceptable. In rainy and post-rainy periods, the river improved and was found within the range of polluted to not very polluted, in the mean time the entire lake was mantained within not very polluted and acceptable. According to the IBE, which was only applied to the river, the upper basin was placed within the range of polluted to severe pollution, while the intermediate and lower basin maintained their highly polluted conditions; for rainy and post-rainy seasons, the conditions improved smoothly.

Detection was optimized through adjustments to the medium's composition and a quantifying strategy. Specificity of the bioassay was tested on microorganisms known for siderophore production. As a result, a total of 48 microorganisms were isolated from three different types of samples (fresh water, salt water, and alkaline soil), of which 36 were determined as siderophore producers. The compounds identified through this method belonged to both hydroxamate and catechol-types, previously reported to cause color change of the CAS medium from blue to orange and purple, respectively.

This method provides a scaling or fractal exponent αx derived from the behaviour of the root-mean-square fluctuations along different time scales n. Rather than just finding a single exponent, covering either short (α1) or long range (α2), we recently suggested tracking the local evolution of αx, as in this way scaling patterns (SP), which seem to provide more detailed characterizations of HRV data, are revealed. Here, we evaluate such potential advantage by classifying long-term data from 51 subjects in normal sinus rhythm and 29 congestive heart failure patients. Using the SP we achieved a significantly better classification of these data than using αx, or the statistic pNN20, thereby confirming that the SP provide a useful assessment of the correlation structure in HRV data. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.;Detrended fluctuation analysis | Heart rate variability | Power-law | Scaling behaviour | αβ filter;21;0;;;;undefined;

This study investigated the role of POD in maize (Zea mays L.) resistance to the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (Motsch.). Insect bioassays were performed under controlled conditions to assess maize weevil resistance. Peroxidase activity was measured in the major grain tissues using guaiacol and peroxide. Significant variation (P > 0.001) among genotypes was observed in both the insect bioassay traits and POD activity. Peroxidase was detected in the embryo, endosperm, and pedicel, but it was not detected in the pericarp. Significant correlations were found between endosperm POD activity and maize weevil resistance (r = 0.89, P < 0.001). Histological staining confirmed POD activity in the vascular cylinder of the embryo, while activity in the endosperm was restricted to the aleurone layer. This study shows that POD activity is correlated with maize weevil resistance and may be used as a potential biochemical marker. © Crop Science Society of America.;;35;0;;;;undefined;

In filamentous fungi, diverse PKSs and NRPSs participate in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as pigments, antibiotics, siderophores, and mycotoxins. However, many secondary metabolites as well as the enzymes involved in their production are yet to be discovered. Both PKSs and NRPSs require activation by enzyme members of the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) family. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of Aspergillus nidulans strains carrying conditional (cfwA2) and null (ΔcfwA) mutant alleles of the cfwA gene, encoding an essential PPTase. We identify the polyketides shamixanthone, emericellin, and dehydroaustinol as well as the sterols ergosterol, peroxiergosterol, and cerevisterol in extracts from A. nidulans large-scale cultures. The PPTase CfwA/NpgA was required for the production of these polyketide compounds but dispensable for ergosterol and cerevisterol and for fatty acid biosynthesis. The asexual sporulation defects of cfwA, ΔfluG, and ΔtmpA mutants were not rescued by the cfwA-dependent compounds identified here. However, a cfwA2 mutation enhanced the sporulation defects of both ΔtmpA and ΔfluG single mutants, suggesting that unidentified CfwA-dependent PKSs and/or NRPSs are involved in the production of hitherto-unknown compounds required for sporulation. Our results expand the number of known and predicted secondary metabolites requiring CfwA/NpgA for their biosynthesis and, together with the phylogenetic analysis of fungal PPTases, suggest that a single PPTase is responsible for the activation of all PKSs and NRPSs in A. nidulans.

There are not enough studies showing how the nonacute malathion doses affect gene expression. This study analyzes gene expression alterations in pig morular embryos exposed in vitro, for 96 h, to several malathion concentrations after in vitro fertilization. cDNA libraries of isolated morular embryos were created and differential screenings performed to identify target genes. Seven clones were certainly identified. Genes related to mitochondrial metabolism as cytochrome c subunits I and III, nuclear genes such as major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I), and a hypothetical protein related with a splicing factor were the target of malathion's deregulation effect.

Modern studies support the existence in this cortex of compounds with cicatrizing properties. In the present study the therapeutic effectiveness of an extract elaborated with this bark in the treatment of venous leg ulceration disease was explored. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with ambulatory patients distributed into two groups, one receiving a hydrogel containing 5% of a crude extract standardized in its tannin concentration (1.8%), while the control group, was administered the same hydrogel but without addition of the extract. In both aseptic washings were performed initially followed by topical application of the corresponding hydrogel and dressing. Follow-up lasted 13 weeks and ulcer healing was determined through measurement of the lesion area by digital-photographic parameters. Therapeutic effectiveness occurred in all patients of the extract group; after the 8th treatment week, ulcer size was reduced by 92% as mean value in this group, whereas therapeutic effectiveness was observed only in one patient of the control group (χ2, p = 0.0001).

(Caesalpiniaceae) (TpPs). Gas chromatography analysis of a hydrolyzed sample confirmed the main chain of (1→4)-β-D-glucan, containing glucose, xylose, and galactose. TpPs was assayed in febrile rats and Balb/c mice. Pyrexia was induced in rats by subcutaneous yeast injection, and in mice with an intraperitoneal injection of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli. Animals were treated with different oral TpPs doses (5-100 mg/kg). A significant dose-dependent reduction of the rectal temperature was observed. We also analyzed the effect on cytokines response to in vitro TpPs treatment in peritoneal exudates cells (PECs), as well as in response to LPS cell stimulation. IL-1β and IL-6 cytokines were measured in the supernatants through ELISA assays. Cells treated with LPS (10 μg/mL) or TpPs (100 μg/mL) alone resulted in a significant release of IL-1β. Our results indicate that, depending upon the experimental conditions, TpPs (0.005-0.5 μg/mL) abolished the IL-1β response to LPS cell stimulation, but at higher doses (50-100 μg/mL) increased it, and reduced significantly the IL-6 response. In febrile rats and Balb/c mice, TpPs did prevent fever in a dose-dependent manner. These preliminary findings show an in vitro modulating effect by TpPs in IL-1β profile at the local immune cellular level, and both febrifuge and hypothermic responses in a mouse model. © 2007 Informa Healthcare.;Fever | Interleukin-1β | Interleukin-6 | Polysaccharide | Pulp | Tamarindus indica Linn. | Xyloglucan;3;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The aims of this work were to carry out a review of cancer investigation presented at the First National Congress of Medical Chemistry (FNMMC) in 2004 in Oaxaca, Mexico, and to identify the principles from vegetal origin with anti-cancer properties. In addition, we looked to see if these natural products were available as drugs in several reference books. The FNMMC ""Proceedings"" was reviewed and the descriptions of research performed with plants or products derived from them were selected. Only 11 of 90 works presented at the Congress were related to plants; the rest of them (79) were related to chemical synthesis, cassiopeinas1 derivatives, genetics, anti-androgens and estrogens, and others. We looked for common and scientific names, active principals, experimental models, anti-cancer effect-mechanisms, pharmacological actions, clinical uses and places of origin of the plant. Forty one percent of studies described chemical synthesis and cassiopeinas, 12.22% were related to natural products and 7.7% were clinical studies but no one involved natural products.

In recent years, Arylsulfatase A (AS-A) has been acquiring an important role from the various putative gamete interaction responsibles in sperm. The aim of this study was to determine if the capacitated boar sperm Arylsulfatase-A (AS-A), contains D-mannose, N-acetylglucosamine and/or sialic acid residues by its purification using affinity chromatography with Concanavalia ensiformis Agglutinin(Con-A) or Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) as ligands. Sperm samples were capacitated in TALP-HEPES medium. Protein extract was added to the affinity columns. Sequencing of retained proteins was done after SDS-PAGE. Total capacitated sperm proteins electrophoresis showed molecular masses between 14 kDa and 102 kDa. A major band of 68 kDa, and 2 minor bands of 52 kDa and 47 kDa were observed. They were AS-A, hyaluronidase and lactadherin, respectively. The Con-A-retained proteins (RP) pattern showed bands from 14 to 98 kDa. After sequencing and BLAST analysis, the 62 kDa band corresponded to Arylsulfatase-A. The WGA RP fraction showed bands from 14 to 100 kDa. The 65 kDa band corresponded to AS-A. This study showed that AS-A has mannose, N-acetylglucosamine and/or sialic acid residues as part of its glycosilation. In this study AS-A was isolated from boar capacitated sperm by affinity chromatography using separately Con-A and WGA, indicating that there are mannose, N-acetylglucosamine and/or sialic acid residues in its glycosilation. AS-A is a membrane protein of capacitated sperm. Further investigation is needed to fully characterize the glycosidic residues bore by AS-A and to determine its function.

For thermal treatments of CP at 121 °C for 10, 20, 30 and 40 min, no significant difference in spore production yield was observed. Maximum sporulation yield was found at 25°C; when the incubation temperature was higher than 30°C, the sporulation yield decreased significantly. A spore production yield of 3.7 × 109 spores g-1 dry CP was obtained when continuous mixing (0.25 rpm) was used at pilot plant scale; however, a decrease in spore yield (1.4 × 109 spores g-1 dry CP) was observed under static conditions. Spore production was not affected when a scale factor between 79 and 105 was assayed from laboratory to pilot plant; at this level, the productivity obtained was 3.1 × 107 spores g-1 dry CP h-1.

The productivity of the wheat straw and wheat-grain-based spawn in cylindrical polyethylene bags containing 5 kg of chopped straw was also determined. We observed high activity of proteases and high content of intracellular protein in cultures grown on wheat straw. This suggests that the proteases are not secreted into the medium and that the protein is an important cellular reserve. On the contrary, cultures grown on wheat straw secreted laccases into the medium, which could be induced by this substrate. P. ostreatus grown on media prepared with a combination of wheat straw and wheat grain showed a high radial growth rate in Petri dishes and a high level of mycelial growth in bottles.

Subjects: A sample of 1092 men and 1247 women, apparently healthy, aged 20-69, was studied. Methods: Participants were asked to identify the silhouette that most accurately represented his/her body size. Weight and height were measured in duplicate to calculate BMI. A simple linear regression analysis was used to adjust BMI values to silhouette categories by gender. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated to assess accuracy. Results: Gender-specific BMI values for each silhouette were obtained. Correlation coefficients between silhouette ratings and BMI were 0.702 in males and 0.766 in females. Overweight ranged from silhouette 4 to 6 and obesity from silhouette 6 to 9, in both men and women. In the regression models, 49.3% of BMI variance in males and 58.7% in females were explained statistically by silhouette self-selection. AUC were higher than 0.8 for overweight and obesity in males and females. Conclusions: Both male and female models had a good fit, indicating that BMI can be associated with body shape silhouettes. Silhouettes can be useful for defining overweight and obesity in settings such as schools or worksites, or where scales and stadiometers might not be available. They can also be used to provide health advice to the public. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.;Adults | Body image | Body mass index | Body size | Mexican | Obesity | Silhouettes;29;0;;;;undefined;

The contribution of both researchers were different: Warren, pathologist, observed the bacterium in the inflamed gastric tissue and ascribed it as causal agent. Also, he identified the bacterium in the inflamed tissue of the gastric and duodenal ulcer. The use of silver staining and electron-microscopy contributed to identify the bacterium. Marshall, gastroenterologist, obtained the bacterium culture by the use of a suitable nutritious media. To fulfil the Koch's postulates he self-inoculated by oral ingestion of a Helicobacter culture resulting en acute gastritis that cured by antibiotics. Also, he planned clinical assays to achieve efficient eradication regimes. He discovered the rapid urease test with gastric biopsies (CLO-test) and the 14C-urea breath test for the diagnosis. The Hp discovery, criticized at the beginning and non-accepted by the most, inspired and stimulated to many others to research on the injuries of the gastroduodenal mucosa related to Hp infection. In fact, epidemiological studies showed 20-80% prevalence of Hp in healthy people, variable in relationship to economic, social and hygienic levels. In patients with gastritis, peptic ulcer, gastric carcinoma and lymphoma the infection achieved 80-90%. Consequently, their diagnosis included the histology, culture, urease, urea breath test and others. Their treatment is based on antibiotics to cure the infection.;Helicobacter pylori | Helicobacter pylori gastritis | Helicobacter pylori peptic ulcer | Marshall-Warren Nobel Prize | Nobel Prize in Medicine | Nobel Prize in Phisiology or Medicine for 2005;0;0;;;;undefined;

They have a wide range of applications in food and textile processing, degumming of plant rough fibres and treatment of pectic wastewaters. Bacteria, yeasts and fungi under both submerged (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF) conditions produce these enzymes. Bacteria produce mainly alkaline and thermostable PGases, whilst fungi are the major producers of acidic PGases. In order to obtain high yields of pectinase production, strain improvement and optimization of culture conditions should be considered. This review is an overview of the microorganisms, substrates, and type of culture used for PGase production. It also provides a description about the strategies used to enhance the production of PGases.;Alkaline pectinases | Pectinases | Polygalacturonases | Thermostable pectinases;105;0;;;;undefined;

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of LAB inoculation and lactic acid on development of spoilage bacteria in vacuum-packaged beef. Finely cut meat was inoculated with Pseudomonas fluorescens, Brochothrix thermosphacta and Lactobacillus minor, and treated with a LAB inoculum (Lactobacillus carnis, Lactobacillus pentosus and Staphylococcus carnosus) and lactic acid (200 mg/100 g of meat). The samples were vacuum-packaged and stored for 12 and 6 days at 4 and 20C, respectively. Aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae species, Pseudomonas spp., B. thermosphacta, and heterofermentative LAB counts and pH were analyzed. Lactic acid was the most efficient treatment for controlling spoilage populations. LAB should be considered only as an additional factor parallel to other preservation methods to keep spoilage populations low enough as to extend meat shelf life. © 2006, Blackwell Publishing.;;16;0;;;;undefined;

To date, molecular genetic studies in several families affected with AD have identified three genes associated with highly penetrant early-onset AD: Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and β-amyloid precursor protein (APP); and one gene (apolipoprotein E) associated with late-onset AD. Molecular analysis of the PSEN1 gene was performed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. The possible founder effect was investigated analyzing two highly polymorphic microsatellite markers flanking the PSEN1 gene. Twelve unrelated Mexican families with early-onset AD were analyzed. The Ala431Glu mutation in exon 12 of PSEN1 was found in nine (75%) of these families, which segregated showing autosomal dominant inheritance. Because all families bearing the mutation are from the State of Jalisco (located in Western Mexico), a founder effect was hypothesized. Microsatellite haplotype analysis suggested a common ancestor in these nine kindreds. In conclusion, the Ala431Glu mutation is a prevalent cause of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease in families from the State of Jalisco, Mexico. Genetic evidence supports that it is a founder mutation descending from a single common ancestor. These findings have important implications for prompt diagnosis and genetic counseling for Mexican patients with familial AD from Jalisco. © Springer-Verlag 2006.";Early-onset Alzheimer's disease | Founder effect | Mutation | PSEN1 gene;32;0;;;;undefined;

This study was conducted to determine the role played by peroxidase in the process of invasion of coffee stems by Cuscuta jalapensis. The in situ activity of peroxidase during the phases of attachment and host penetration, was determined by histochemical tests. These tests indicate the activity of peroxidase in relation to morphological changes that take place, during the development of the haustorial cushion on the cell walls and vacuoles of the epidermal cells, and during the processes of disorganization of the tissue of Cuscuta stems and formation of the haustorium. The activity of peroxidase was shown to be associated with the processes of invasion and destruction of tissues of the host up until the moment when the haustorium makes contact with the vascular bundle. The activity of peroxidase in the cell walls of Cuscuta jalapensis is intimately associated to the morphogenesis of the adherence structures, as well as to the processes leading to the invasion of the host. We propose that this enzyme be included within the set of compounds elements needed to initiate an invasion of a host by a parasitic angiosperm. The information acquired gives significance to the probable participation of free radicals and their reactivity in relation to the morphogenesis and invasion processes. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Hierarchical linear modeling is used to analyze the relationships of the volume of alcohol consumed prior to injury and feeling drunk at the time of the event with causal attribution, as well as the association of aggregate individual-level and socio-cultural variables on these relationships. Data analyzed are from 1955 ER patients who reported drinking prior to injury included in 35 ERs from 24 studies covering 15 countries from the combined Emergency Room Collaborative Alcohol Analysis Project (ERCAAP) and the WHO Collaborative Study on Alcohol and Injuries. Half of those patients drinking prior to injury attributed a causal association of their injury with alcohol consumption, but the rate of causal attribution varied significantly across studies. When controlling for gender and age, the volume of alcohol consumed and feeling drunk (controlling for volume) were both significantly predictive of attribution and this did not vary across studies. Those who drink at least weekly were less likely to attribute causality at a low volume level, but more likely at high volume levels than less frequent drinkers. Attribution of causality was also less likely at low volume levels in those societies with low detrimental drinking patterns, but more likely at high volume levels or when feeling drunk compared to societies with high detrimental drinking patterns. These findings have important implications for brief intervention in the ER if motivation to change drinking behavior is greater among those attributing a causal association of their drinking with injury. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These lipid alterations are key factors in the emergence of microvascular complications, which lead to death in those patients. Yet, zinc sulfate supplementation may be a therapeutical resource to recover some functioning and improve life span. This article reports the assessment of lipid profile from type 2-diabetes mellitus patients treated with hypoglycemic therapy drugs, who additionally presented zinc levels lower than average in Mexican reference. The patients received a 100 mg zinc sulfate treatment in a crossover double-blind design of clinically controlled study with starch as placebo. The diabetic patients had changes in their lipid profile after a 12-week zinc treatment as compared with placebo treatment. The 100 mg zinc sulfate treatment was well tolerated, significantly reduced total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, and increased those corresponding to zinc as well as HDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. Thus, using this treatment the cardiovascular involvement is expected to decrease in the type 2-diabetes mellitus patients, especially those with myocardial infarction and stroke, which are the main death causes in Mexico. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

Four bands of proteins with molecular weights of 123.1, 85.5, 33.1 and 23 kDa were detected in UFL by SDS-PAGE. In order to increase solubilities of the substrates, α and β-chitins were treated with alkali; degrees of deacetylation (DD) were determined 55 and 50%, respectively. Thereafter, chitin hydrolysis with UFL was carried out at 40°C and pH 5, Endo and NHase at these conditions were 619 and 355 U/mg of protein, respectively. The partial deacetylation as well as the use of acidified reaction media improved significantly the enzyme efficiency in terms of yields of chitin oligosaccharides produced and process time.

In addition, to search for possible adverse effects after treatment, the measurement of some biochemical, haematological and physiological parameters were also analysed. Eighteen crossbred heifers were divided into six groups of three animals each. Groups 1-5 received a single oral dose of 12, 36, 60, 120 and 180 mg/kg of body weight (bw) of compound alpha. Group 6 served as an untreated control. To determine the biochemical, haematological and enzymatic parameters, sera and blood samples were individually taken at 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, and 720 h after treatment. Physiological parameters such as rectal temperature, heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and ruminal motility were measured at the time intervals mentioned above. Estimation of the MTD and SI was obtained by using the formula reported by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the results showing an MTD of 180 mg/kg/bw and an SI of 15 times the recommended clinical dose. Some statistical differences were observed in a few of the biochemical, haematological and enzymatic parameters, the adverse effects being not highly representative. Alterations on HR and RR were statistically different (P < 0.05) only in heifers treated with 180 mg. © 2006 The Authors.;;4;0;;;;undefined;

Moreover, the short-range fractal or scaling exponent α1 extracted from these correlations has been found to be a predictor of mortality for subjects with an impaired left ventricular function. In general, the RR-interval data required for this analysis are derived from long-term ECG recordings during free-running conditions. Yet short-term recordings are more likely to be obtained in some practical circumstances, so becoming relevant to assess the possibility of obtaining representative α1 exponents from these recordings. Here, we compare the α1 exponents extracted from the RR-interval series (9:00 am-6:00 pm) of 51 healthy adults in normal sinus rhythm and the α1 calculated from three shorted segments of only 700 beats obtained from the same series at 9:00 am, 1:30 pm and 5:00 pm. We found no significant differences between the scaling exponents derived from the whole 9 h series and the short segments at 9:00 am and 5:00 pm, but did find significant differences when comparing the whole series with the short segment at 1:30 pm. Thus, only if the time of day is taken into consideration can short segments of heartbeat fluctuation data be used to obtain representative α1 exponents. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.;Circadian rhythm | Detrended fluctuation analysis | Heart rate variability | Power law;9;0;;;;undefined;

Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that an apparently identical senescent state can also be prematurely induced in vitro in different cell types following sublethal oxidative stress stimuli. The former suggests a molecular link between cell cycle regulation and cell survival that could involve regulatory proteins such as Bcl-2. There is strong evidence that, in addition to its well-known effects on apoptosis, Bcl-2 is involved in antioxidant protection and regulation of cell cycle progression. The aim of this work was to determine if the protection against oxidative stress mediated by Bcl-2 could prevent or delay oxidative stress-induced senescence. Using a retroviral infection system, Bcl-2 was overexpressed in primary, nonembryonic mice fibroblasts obtained from lungs derived from 2-month-old CD1 mice. Fibroblasts overexpressing Bcl-2 were exposed to 75 μM H2O2 for 2 h to induce SIPS. The rate of proliferation and the increment of senescent cells were then determined. Our results indicate that overexpression of Bcl-2 protected primary fibroblasts against oxidative stress-mediated reduction in cell proliferation, but did not prevent premature senescence. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-one fighting cows and seven calves were injected with 10 and 4 mL of sodium selenite (5 mg of Se as sodium selenite mL -1) respectively. The Se level in blood before the Se injection was 0.054 ± 0.017 in cows and 0.04 ± 0.014 in calves. After 40 days of the Se injection, the Se level in blood was significant (P < 0.05) in cows (0.103 ± 0040) and calves (0.108 ± 0.021), respectively. The postmortem examination of four calves showed chalky white streaks in the muscles of the heart and back. The microscopic lesions were characteristic of muscular dystrophy. The concentration of Se in the pasture was 0.062 ± 0.011 (mean ± SE; n = 20). The concentrations of Se and pH in the soil were 0.051 ± 0.016 and 5.9 ± 1.3 (mean ± SE; n = 10), respectively. The soil and pasture samples had low concentrations of Se and pH, so, the soil was acid.

To investigate the ecological factors that limit their distribution and abundance, we surveyed 80 localities within the region of Tehuacan-Cuicatlán, in Central Mexico. At each locality we measured several environmental variables, and the density of the Neobuxbaumia populations present. We used a principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the factors that are associated to the presence/absence of each species. Additionally, we carried out multiple regressions between environmental variables and population density to test whether the variation in these variables was related to changes in abundance. The results show that factors significantly affecting the distribution of these species are mean annual temperature, altitude, rainfall, and soil properties such as texture and organic matter content. N. mezcalaensis reaches maximum population densities of 14,740 plants per ha (average density = 3943 plants per ha) and is associated with localities with relatively abundant rainfall. N. tetetzo shows maximum population densities of 14,060 plants per ha (average = 3070 plants per ha), and is associated with sites located at high latitudes and with high phosphorous content in the soil. The rarest species, N. macrocephala, shows maximum densities of 1180 plants per ha (average = 607 plants per ha) and is associated with localities with high soil calcium content. The distribution of this species is limited to sites with specific values of the environmental variables recorded, conferring it a high habitat specificity which accounts for its rarity. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

To date, surgery is the mainstay of treatment. However, patients with mandibular osteosarcomas usually have a locally advanced disease at diagnosis and therefore represent a therapeutic challenge because surgical margins are difficult to obtain due to aesthetic and functional concerns. To evaluate possible prognostic factors implicated in recurrence, persistence or relapse in osteosarcoma of the mandible, with special reference to the soft tissue and bone surgical margins. A series of 20 patients with mandibular osteosarcomas treated at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología (México) from 1985 to 1999 are reviewed. There were 14 female and 6 male patients. Twelve cases were treated with surgery alone, 3 patients with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, 1 had neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery, 1 had neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and postoperative radiotherapy, 1 with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, 1 with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy and one patient rejected treatment. Between 1985 and 1992 these neoplasms were treated by means of total mandibulectomy, independently of tumor size, but between 1993 and 1999 the policy was to practice smaller resections but long enough to obtain macroscopic surgical free margins. In the first period the relationship between mandibular size resection and tumor size was 1.9, meanwhile in the second period the relation was 1.5. There was not significant difference between both periods in terms of tumor size (6.0 cm vs. 6.02 cm at the time of surgery) nor in local control and survival. Soft tissue involvement as reported by histological study was strongly associated with recurrence (p = 0.0024). Overall 5-year survival was 20%. A policy of total mandibulectomy is not associated with a better local control or survival. Extent of resection must be tailored with tumor size. Extent of margins in soft tissue is the limiting factor for local control. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;Head and neck | Jaws | Osteosarcoma | Surgical margins;30;0;;;;undefined;

Several resistance systems have been directly characterized by genetic and biochemical tests, whereas other may only be inferred by comparison with the systems encoded in the genomes of other bacteria. This review briefly summarizes the mechanisms of resistance to heavy metals in pseudomonads. For this purpose, metals have been divided into three groups: (i) micronutrient cations that show toxicity (copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc); (ii) nonessential toxic cations (cadmium, lead, mercury, siliver); and (iii) toxic oxyanions (derived from arsenic, chromium, selenium and tellurium). Pseudomonads have evolved two main strategies to cope with heavy metal toxicity: membrane transporters able to efflux toxic ions from the cytoplasm, which include members of the major membrane protein families, and enzymatic redox detoxification pathways, which transform metals to less-toxic forms. Most heavy metal resistance systems in pseudomonads are encoded by complex operons, located on chromosomes or on plasmids, commonly involving delicate regulatory switches functioning at the transcriptional level. The abundance and diversity of genetic determinants conferring metal tolerance in the genomes of pseudomonads may be associated with the varied environments that these versatile bacteria inhabit.";Efflux systems | Metal detoxification | Metal resistance | Metal toxicity;9;0;;;;undefined;

Results showed that adaptation to acid by these E. coli strains significantly enhances their survival in acid conditions. Changes in Omp profiles were found in non-adapted acid challenged cells compared with non-challenged cells that had not been adapted to acid. Challenged adapted cells showed no significant changes in these profiles when compared with the acid adapted non-challenged strains. N-terminal sequences of some of the Omps were determined. The intensity of the main porins OmpC and OmpA was lower in the acid challenged strains, than in the non-challenged ones. The OmpF porin was identified in non-challenged K12 strain, but did not appear in adapted or non-adapted pozol strains nor in E. coli O157:H7.

A total of 216 samples were collected with 329 individuals of D. auratus and 170 of E. melanopterus. Diapterus auratus individuals were captured throughout a wider range of environmental conditions, and consequently its spatial niche breadth was significantly greater (P < 0.001) than that of E. melanopterus. In general, more individuals were captured at localities with submerged vegetation (Ruppia maritima), with 70% for D. auratus and 87.2% for E. melanopterus, although only the latter species showed significant spatial differences. A spatial segregation influenced by distance from the lagoon inlet and salinity was observed between the species. It is considered that this segregation may allow resource partitioning and minimize interspecific competition. A relatively low niche overlap (4.9%) was observed for the two species. Seasonal capture peaks of D. auratus were related to rainfall and the productivity pattern in the lagoon system. Seasonal fluctuations in monthly mean number of D. auratus were correlated with preceding variations in local rainfall (r = 0.86, P < 0.02). Moreover, seasonal capture peaks of D. auratus coincided with ecosystem primary production peaks. Although E. melanopterus exhibited no significant seasonal differences, its maximum numbers also coincided with an ecosystem primary production peak and recruitment patterns. In 24-h cycle analysis, both species were captured mainly around mid-day, with minor peaks at dawn and/or at dusk. Generally, few individuals were collected during hours of darkness. It was proposed that diel abundance variation of gerreids might be related to both light penetration in the water column and feeding activity. Food availability within Pueblo Viejo lagoon appears to be an important factor influencing fish abundance. © 2005 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.;;16;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

High activity of proteases and high content of intecellular protein in cultures grown on wheat straw, suggest that the proteases are not secreted into the medium, and that the protein is an important cellular reserve. On the contrary, cultures grown on wheat straw secreted laccase into the medium, which was induced by this substrate. P. ostreatus grown on the medium made of combination of wheat straw and wheat grain showed high radial mycelial growth rate in Petri dishes and high mycelial growth rate in jars.

Among different heavy metals, copper compounds are commonly used for eliminating algal blooms in aquaculture tanks. At certain concentrations, copper is toxic to rotifers. In the present work, we evaluated the combined effects of salt concentrations (2.5 and 5.0 g l-1 NaCl), copper levels (0, 0.03125, 0.0625, 0.125 and 0.25 mg l-1 as CuCl2) and two temperatures (20 and 25°C) on the population growth of B. rotundiformis using Chlorella as the algal food (at 0.5 × 106 cells ml -1 for every 24 h). Regardless of salinity and temperature, copper at concentrations as low as 0.03 mg l-1 had an adverse effect on the population growth of rotifers and above 0.125 mg l-1, the populations did not grow. The effect of the toxicant on B. rotundiformis was more severe at 25°than at 20°C at lower salinity. In general, we observed peak densities of rotifers around day 12 at 20°C but 6-8 days earlier at 25°C. Peak population densities of B. rotundiformis in the controls at the salinity of 2.5 g l-1 ranged from 90 to 180 ind. ml-1, depending on temperature; at a salinity of 5.0 g l-1, these were lower. The population growth rates, r, in our study varied from +0.31 to -0.12 depending on the test conditions. There was a significant impact of temperature, salinity and toxicity level on the population growth rate of B. rotundiformis. Our results suggested that even narrow changes in salinity could negatively influence the toxicity of heavy metal on the population growth rates of B. rotundiformis. © Springer 2005.";Copper toxicity | Rotifers | Salinity | Temperature;26;0;;;;undefined;

The goal of this study was to assess the effect on domestic and wild fowl pooled semen and individual ejaculate cryopreservation with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Twenty ejaculates and twenty samples of pooled semen of roosters, pheasants and hawks were frozen in media containing DMSO or PVP. DMSO and PVP cryopreservation are equally effective both for ejaculates and pooled semen. Even PVP is a good alternative since no significant difference was found when compared to DMSO. The fertilizing capacity of fresh and cryopreserved pooled semen was analyzed through AI of hens and female pheasants. Similar fertility rates using DMSO, PVP or frozen-thawed samples demonstrated that reproduction is possible through the use of cryopreserved semen. In the case of female pheasants, the same values were obtained with both cryopreserved and fresh semen.

Aromatizable androgens: androstenedione (A) and testosterone (T), a non-aromatizable androgen: 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), as well as estrogens (E 2 and E1) alone or in combination with DHT, were administered in gonadectomized, sexually experienced males, for 3 weeks. In addition, plasma levels of these steroids were determined. Gonadectomy completely suppressed masculine sexual behavior (MSB) after 4 weeks. Both A and T replacements restored all the sexual behavior parameters in castrated hamsters by the 3rd week of treatment, with A being more potent in restoring all copulatory series and maintaining all MSB parameters, including long intromissions. Castrated males treated with DHT showed little interest in the female and did not display any copulatory behavior. Gonadectomized males treated with estrogens alone showed active anogenital investigation and displayed some mounts, but did not ejaculate. Males treated with estrogens combined with DHT had longer latencies and less number of ejaculations than males treated with aromatizable androgens. Long intromissions were observed only in males treated with T or A. Plasma levels of A were significantly higher than T levels in intact males. In males treated with A both androgens and estrogens were present in plasma. These results support the notion that aromatizable androgens, mainly A, but not non-aromatizable androgens or even estrogens in combination with DHT, play a relevant role in the endocrine regulation of MSB in the golden hamster.;Androgens | Castration | Golden hamsters | Male sexual behavior;28;0;;;;undefined;

The hybrid cells kept the capacity of insulin production, its regulation, and the natural control of glycemia, as well as the factors of histocompatibility to avoid the rejection. Four groups of four rats each were established: Group 1. Healthy animals (healthy control), Group 2. Diabetized non-treated animals (diabetic control), Group 3. Transplant recipient rats with extraction of dermic cells which were mixed with pancreatic insular cells from a healthy donor (transplant without fusion), and Group 4. Transplant recipient rats, with extraction of dermic cells which were electrofused with pancreatic insular cells from a healthy donor (transplant with fusion). For the Group 4, the cells were combined and they were submitted to dielectrophoresis conditions with an alternating current pulse of 15 s of 10 V RMS of 0.5 MHz. The fusion was made with a direct current pulse of 1:ms of 300:V. Clinical signs were registered (weight, diuresis, food and water intake), and several biochemical parameters in blood which included basal glycemia, uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, glutamate oxalacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, urea, creatinine, insulin, glycated hemoglobin were registered. Additionally, ketone bodies and glucose were also measured in urine. All determinations were made at 30, 60, and 90 days. Animals of Group 1 maintained its parameters within the normal ranges. Rats of Group 2 presented alterations corresponding to a diabetic state in almost all the parameters measured, none of the animals showed a tendency to improve spontaneously, two of the rats died at 66 and 72 days. The Group 3 showed a clinical profile similar to the diabetic control group without improvement, only one rat died at day 33, while in the rats transplanted with fusion (Group 4) an improvement was observed on some parameters including body weight, water intake and glycemia. Although insulin concentration was under the normal range, it was higher than in the Group 3. None rat died. These results indicate that it is possible to improve the diabetic profile by the transplant of dermic cells from a diabetic animal fused with insular cells from a healthy donor in the recipient animal. © 2005 Elsevier SAS.

The influence of these new aromatic monomers on various physicochemical, setting and mechanical properties was assessed. Surface characterization demonstrated that bone cements prepared with any of the functionalized monomers exhibited increasing hydrophilicity with monomer concentration and that the aromatic monomers provided more hydrophilic cements than their aliphatic counterparts for low concentrations of the functional monomer. It was also found that bone cements prepared with high amounts of the acidic aliphatic monomer provided the highest exotherm of reaction and their setting times were shorter than MBA based cements. On the other hand, DEABM containing bone cements exhibited shorter setting times than DEAEM formulations and slightly higher peak temperatures. In general, it was found that the glass transition temperature increased with the presence of acidic comonomer and decreased when alkaline comonomers were present, especially aliphatic ones. When aromatic methacrylates were used at 0.05 molar fraction, the highest tensile and compressive strength were achieved i.e. 46 and 118 MPa for MBA and 51 and 108 MPa for DEABM formulations. A further increase in the aromatic monomer concentration led to cements of low mechanical properties due to solubility problems as revealed by SEM. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been shown that IL-10 has diverse and potentially pleiotropic actions that suggest that it may have a direct effect on apoptosis. It has been established that NF-κB activation is essential to protect hepatocytes from apoptosis. The purpose of the present work is to evaluate the effect of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 on the activation of NF-κB in primary cultured rat hepatocytes and hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cell line and explore its consequences on apoptosis. Apoptosis was induced by TNF-α and cicloheximide in HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells and by ethanol and a glutathione depletor in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. NF-κB activation was determined by EMSA. IL-10 increased ethanol induced apoptosis in primary culture rat hepatocytes (28%). These effects were enhanced when the cells were pre-treated with IL-10 under conditions of oxidative stress (glutathione depletion). The effects of IL-10 on primary cultured hepatocytes were independent of NF-κB activation. When apoptosis was induced by cicloheximide and TNF-α in hepatoblastoma cells, pretreatment with IL-10 was accompanied by a decrease of 38% in apoptosis. IL-10 did not have any effect on the signaling cascade of apoptosis but caused a significant increase in NF-κB activation. When NF-κB activation was inhibited by sulfazalazine the decrease in apoptosis was reversed. The present study demonstrates the importance of differential cell marking when trying to characterize the effects of cytokines in their contribution to liver cell apoptosis. The study provides insight into the mechanisms by which IL-10 affects apoptosis through a differential effect on NF-κB activation. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Multiple abnormalities in the immune response, including cytokine production, in protein energy-malnourished children have been described and could account for the increased severity and frequency of infections. In this study, we used flow cytometry to investigate the effects of malnutrition on the production of cytokines (interleukin-2 [IL-2], gamma interferon [IFN-γ], IL-4, and IL-10) in CD4+ and CD8+ cells and the activation capability (as indicated by CD69+ and CD25+ cells). CD4+ and CD8+ cells from malnourished children showed increased production of IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines and decreased production of IL-2 and IFN-γ cytokines compared to that in cells from well-nourished, uninfected and well-nourished, infected children. In addition, malnourished children showed impaired activation capability, since the fluorescence intensity of CD69 + and CD25+ cells was lower than that in cells from well-nourished, uninfected and well-nourished, infected children. These results indicate that malnutrition alters the capacity of CD4+ and CD8 +cells to produce IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10 in response to stimulus. We concluded that both cytokine production and activation capacity were impaired in malnourished children. This functional impairment may be involved in the failure to develop a specific immune response and the predisposition to infection in these children.

Culture media (MRS or APT) had no significant effect on bacteriocin production (p < 0.060) although higher activity was observed in MRS (220 AU|mL). Conversely, temperature significant affected production (p > 0.001). Bacteriocin activity was also increased by 100% nitrogen atmosphere (180 AU|mL) as compared to N2 CO2 (50:50) (ISOAU/mL) and 100% CO2 (60 AU|mL). Maximum activity occurred at the end of the exponential growth phase. This bacteriocin inhibited some Listeria monocytogens strains and several lactic acid bacteria, mainly Lactobacillus sp.

Estradiol receptor (ER) and androgen receptors (AR) were extracted using 0.6 M KCL and determined by the dextran-coated charcoal method. ER and AR levels were smaller in BPH plasma membranes (PM) than in Pca cases. For fractions 3, 4, 5, the ER values in PCa were 25-38% less with regard to BPH ER values. Whereas in PCa, AR values obtained in all fractions were higher when compared to BPH AR values. In benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic cancer, ER and AR levels were significantly higher in the nuclear fraction. In the nuclear fraction, ER and AR levels in BPH and PCa were significantly different. The subcellular distribution of AR and ER in BPH and PCa constitutes a reservation mechanism and processing of receptors for their continued growth.

In Mexico, scorpion envenomation is considered a public health problem. Despite the frequency of scorpion sting cases, there are to date no uniform criteria for their treatment. In Mexican traditional medicine, different plant species have been widely used as a remedy for treating scorpion poisoning. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of Bouvardia ternifolia, Aristolochia elegans and Vitex mollis extracts on Centruroides limpidus limpidus venom lethality in mice, and to determine their antagonist activity on guinea pig ileum. The hexane and methanol extract from B. ternifolia modified the LD50 of C. limpidus limpidus venom from 0.750±0.08 to 1.64±0.19 and 1.16±0.14 mg/kg, respectively. The extracts of A. elegans produced lower antitoxic activity, while extracts of V. mollis did not show any protection. On in vitro test, addition of B. ternifolia and A. elegans extracts strongly inhibited, in a concentration- dependent manner, the ileum contractions induced by venom. In general, the results demonstrated the effectiveness of these two plant species in modifying the lethality of C. limpidus limpidus venom in mice. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

The aim of the present study was to characterize expression of the Fos protein by immunocytochemistry in the rabbit's SCN under two conditions: light-dark (L/D, 12:12 h, lights on at 7:00 a.m.) every four hours, starting at ZT01 (08:00 h geographical time) and constant darkness (D/D), starting at CT03. We also analyzed the induction of Fos in the SCN in response to a light pulse (850 lux/30 min) at CT03, CT11, CT15 and CT19 in D/D conditions. In L/D there was a clear Fos induction by light at ZT01 and ZT05 (p < 0.01) in comparison to the other time points. In D/D we found an endogenous rhythm of Fos that peaked at CT07 (p < 0.01). Light pulses induced a strong Fos immunoreactivity only during the subjective night at CT15 and CT19, in the ventrolateral region of the SCN (p < 0.05), in contrast to the maximum expression of Fos during L/D and D/D, where only a sparse distribution in the nucleus was found. In conclusion, we found a daily and a circadian rhythm of Fos and a photic induction at times that produce phase-shifts in other species. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.;Circadian rhythms | Fos | Immunocytochemistry | Rabbit | Suprachiasmatic nucleus;6;0;;;NIH;R01 TW006636-01;National Institutes of Health

The model showed a good fit with the experimental data, since the R2 of 0.923 indicated that 92.3% of the variability within the range of values studied could be explained by the model. The mathematical model presented a plateau region with a maximum DH (>26.6%) at the following critical values: pH = 5.9, T = 53°C, S:B = 14.7% and E = 80 LAPU (leucine aminopeptidase units) g -1.

Therefore, the Atoms in Molecules theory was employed to calculate the properties of the critical point such as density, Laplacians, and ellipticities. Furthermore, reactivity descriptors such as local softness were calculated in order to predict the reactive sites in the molecule. These results were corroborated by Laplacian values. The electrophilic attack (high s k-/s k+ value) occurs in the O7′ atom for 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 as well as in the nitrogen atom for 3 and 5. All ligands are susceptible to nucleophilic attacks in the carbonyl carbon, whether such carbon be ester, amide or imide. In accordance with the theoretical calculations, the lowest electron density is located in these regions. Furthermore, the heteroatoms are susceptible to suffering elecrophilic attack, which leads to the conclusion that the ligand-enzyme recognition is by retro-electron donation. This is confirmed by the energies of the HOMO of the aromatic ring as well as the LUMO of the lateral chains. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Cortistatin is a neuropeptide with sleep-modulating properties that regulates memory consolidation and evocation. Several reports have suggested that learning processes are expressed under diurnal variations; therefore, it seems that the efficiency to solve learning tasks is related to the arousal state. Although we know that cortistatin modulates learning, we do not know whether its effect is subjected to diurnal variations. Hence, we evaluated memory evocation and the sleep-waking cycle along the day. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of cortistatin on motor control and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration. Performance of rats was better at 01:00 h than at 13:00 h to solve the Barnes maze. Cortistatin impaired memory evocation, increased rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and decreased wakefulness at 01:00 h, whereas increasing it at 13:00 h. Cortistatin blunts cAMP concentration and impairs motor control at 13:00 h. These results support further a cortistatin modulatory role in the memory process. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the ti-me required for diagnosis, the lesion's locoregional extent and the therapeutic schemes applied, in a retrospective series of 58 patients with CeCa and with lumbar spinal metastases. METHODS: The cases were studied using an updated interdisciplinary analysis to determine the clinical and radiological variables. This study evaluated the site and extent of bone lesions and correlated these variables with instability of the spine and cord compression. RESULTS: The diagnosis of vertebrae metastases of Ce-Ca required more than 3 months in most cases.Lumbar vertebrae L4 and L5 and specifically the vertebral body were the most-frequently affected si-tes. Systemic and/or extra-compartmental-extended metastases (MosV4) were observed in 44/58 patients. Radiotherapy was the only option in this group and the palliative effect achieved was minimal, or null. In 14/58 patients there was intra compartmental-extended (MosV2) and extra-compartmental limited (MosV3) single vertebral metastases and the 3 different treatment schemes were administered. In the cases treated with marginal resection of metastases, vertebroplasty plus adjuvant radiotherapy achieved significant palliative effect. CONCLUSIONS: In the present series of patients, the diagnosis of metastases of the lumbar vertebrae was late, and the disease was advanced. The results obtained with radiotherapy in advanced stage disease did not improve the quality of life of patients. Metastasectomy was the therapeutic scheme in cases with intermediate stage disease and was the basis of the integrated treatment We believe that it is necessary to shorten the diagnostic time and to apply a staging system for vertebral metastases so that appropriate individualised selection of interdisciplinary treatment would be facilitated.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Since changes in endogenous antioxidant systems might contribute to acute Tl+-induced OS and neurotoxicity, in this study we measured the metal concentration and the levels of lipid peroxidation (LP) in different brain regions (hypothalamus (Ht); cerebellum (Ce); striatum (S); hippocampus (Hc) and frontal cortex (Cx)) in possible correlation with the content of reduced glutathione (GSH), the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the animal performance in behavioral tests, all evaluated after a single administration of thallium acetate (8 or 16 mg/kg, i.p.) to rats. Seven days after Tl+ administration, the metal was homogeneously and dose-dependently accumulated in all regions evaluated. LP was increased in Ht, Ce and S, while GSH was depleted in S. Cu,Zn-SOD activity was also decreased in Ht and S. All these changes occurred with 16 mg/kg dose and at 7 days after treatment, but not at 1 or 3 days. In addition, Tl +-treated animals exhibited general hypokinesis, but no changes were observed in spatial learning. Our findings suggest that a delayed response of the brain to Tl+ may be the result of its residual levels. Also, despite the regional alterations produced by Tl+ in LP and the limited changes in endogenous antioxidants, there is a correlation between the Tl+-induced oxidative damage and the affected behavioral tasks, suggesting that, although still moderate, Tl+ evokes neurotoxic patterns under the experimental conditions tested. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Remodelling involves a complex network of cell-cell signalling involving systemic hormones, locally produced cytokines, growth factors and the mechanical environment of the cells. Here, we report on the effect of mechanically-induced strain on the synthesis by mouse calvarial osteoblasts in monolayer culture of IL-10 and IL-12, two cytokines that inhibit osteoclast formation in bone marrow cultures; IL-10 also suppresses osteoblast differentiation suggesting a role for both cytokines in bone physiology. A tensile strain was applied to the cells intermittently for 6 s, every 90 s, for 2-96 h. After 2-h culture, supernatants from deformed cells contained significantly less IL-10 than control cultures. In contrast, mechanical deformation had a stimulatory effect on IL-12 synthesis; however, by 48 h both had returned to control levels. These data suggest that IL-10 and IL-12 can be added to the growing list of mechanical stress-responsive genes. The down-regulation of IL-10 and stimulation of IL-12 further suggests that the initial response of the cells to mechanical deformation was an osteogenic one. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The interaction between infusions of allopregnanolone (intra-NAcc) with systemic administrations of allopregnanolone, muscimol, fluoxetine and GABA-A antagonists was assessed. Results showed that allopregnanolone (intra-NAcc; 1.5 μg, p<0.05; 2.0 μg, p<0.05) or systemic injections of allopregnanolone (1.5 mg/kg, p<0.05; 2.0 mg/kg, p<0.05; s.c.) or muscimol (0.3 mg/kg, p<0.05; 0.6 mg/kg, p<0.05; i.p.) reduced immobility by increasing climbing in the forced swimming task (FST), whereas fluoxetine (1.0 mg/kg, p<0.05; 2.0 mg/kg, p<0.05; i.p.) reduced immobility by increasing swimming. Allopregnanolone (intra-NAcc; 0.5 μg/side) synergized with systemic doses of allopregnanolone (0.5 mg/kg; p<0.05), muscimol (0.1 mg/kg; p<0.05) or fluoxetine (0.5 mg/kg; p<0.05) and reduced immobility by increasing climbing. Picrotoxin (0.125 mg/kg; i.p.) attenuated the synergism of the combination allopregnanolone (intra-NAcc; 0.5 μg/side) plus fluoxetine (i.p.) or allopregnanolone (s.c.) and the effects of allopregnanolone (intra-NAcc; 1.5 μg/side).

Most of these reports suggest that nicotine (NIC) may act as an antidepressant. To examine the suggested antidepressant effect of nicotine and its possible interaction with the serotonergic system, we assessed the effect of nicotine and fluoxetine (FLX) in an animal model of depression induced by neonatal treatment with clomipramine (CLI) and submitted to the forced swim test (FST). Results corroborated that CLI-treated rats displayed higher levels of immobility. After the administration of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg sc) acutely (1 day), subchonically (7 days), and chronically (14 days), CLI-treated rats significantly reduced the immobility and increased swimming without affecting climbing. These effects were similar to the effects induced for subchronic and chronic administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine (5 mg/kg sc), a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor. However, fluoxetine failed to affect immobility when it was administered acutely. No synergism was observed when both drugs were administered simultaneously. The present results further corroborate the antidepressant action of nicotine and fluoxetine. The increase of swimming during the FST has been linked to an increase of serotonergic activity. Thus, it could be possible that the antidepressant action of nicotine is mediated by the serotonergic system. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

It was a community based cross-sectional survey on a sample of 122 community pharmacies and 1220 clients, which were randomly selected. Data were collected by structured and pre-tested questionnaire presented to consumers at the pharmacy exit. A separate structured and pre-tested questionnaire was used for the pharmacy salespeople. Information was collected on all drugs dispensed from the pharmacy (with and without prescription) during an eight-hour study period. Drugs were coded according to therapeutic groups as listed in the Mexican Essential Drug List in conjunction with the Dictionary of Drugs (PLM) that are available in the Mexican market. Data analyses were carried using the SPSS computer statistical software. A total of 1875 drugs were supplied. In all, 1237 products were Rx and 638 OTC drugs; 710 (57.4%) Rx were dispensed with a physician prescription. The most frequent therapeutic group was antibiotic (20.10%). In this study, the prevalence of self-medication was found to be 42.6% (Rx) and OTC medicines was 34.0%.

Trametes sp. I-62 (CECT20197) is a white-rot fungus with potential biotechnological applications. It has been identified as Trametes on the basis of the mycelium morphology, but the features observed are not sufficient for its classification at the species level. Given that this strain produces a very characteristic laccase isozyme pattern, in the present work we compared its isozyme profile with the profiles produced by ten other very closely phylogenetically related fungi from the Polyporaceae family. The data indicates that Trametes sp. I-62 could not be included in any of the taxonomically related species which were analysed in the present work. Extracellular laccases were detected in nine of the fungi studied and in four of them namely Trametes subectypus, Trametes pavonia, Trametes ochracea and Trametes gallica, this is the first report of such activity. Given that phylogenetically related fungi growing in the same culture conditions exhibit different laccase patterns, these isozymes could be used as an additional criterion for fungal identification.;;12;0;;;;undefined;

This compound causes necrosis of pancreatic β-cells and, as is well known, induces oxidant free radicals which play a relevant role in the etiology and pathogenesis of both experimental and human diabetes mellitus. Previously we have reported hypoglycemic and antilipoperoxidative actions of silymarin in serum and pancreatic tissue respectively. The aim of this study was to test whether silymarin could reduce the hyperglycemia and revert the pancreatic damage in alloxan treated rats, tested with silymarin in two protocols: using both compounds simultaneously for four or eight doses, or using the compound 20 days after alloxan administration for 9 weeks. Serum glucose and insulin were determined, and pancreatic fragments were used for histology and insulin immunohistochemistry. Pancreatic islets were isolated to assess insulin and Pdx1 mRNA expression by RT-PCR.Our results showed that 72 hours after alloxan administration, serum glucose increased and serum insulin decreased significantly, whereas pancreatic tissue presented morphological abnormalities such as islet shrinkage, necrotic areas, loss of cell organization, widespread lipoid deposits throughout the exocrine tissue, and loss of beta cells, but insulin and glucagon immunoreactivity was scattered if any. In contrast the pancreatic tissue and both insulin and glucose serum levels of rats treated with silymarin were similar to those of control animals. In addition, insulin and glucagon immunoreactive cells patterns in Langerhans islets were also normal, and normal insulin and Pdx1 mRNA expression patterns were detected during pancreatic recovery in Langerhans islets. The overall results suggest that silymarin induces pancreatic function recovery demonstrated by insulin and glucagon expression protein and normoglycemia after alloxan pancreatic damage in rats. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Insulin induced concentration-dependent increases in the phosphorylation state of the adrenergic receptors in the two models with similar EC 50 values (0.5-2 nM). The effect was rapid in the two systems but it was sustained in rat-1 cells and transient in DDT 1 MF2 cells. In both cell lines, the insulin-mediated phosphorylation of α 1B-adrenoceptors was blocked by wortmannin and LY 294002, and by staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide I, indicating that the effect involved phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase C activities. The adrenoceptor phosphorylation induced by insulin was associated to desensitization as evidences by a diminished elevation of intracellular calcium in response to noradrenaline.

For M. curema, spawning occurred from February-May. Mugil cephalus males and females reach sexual maturation (L50) at a mean size of 373 ± 7.3 and 377 ± 9.3 mm total length (TL), respectively (6 yrs of age for both sexes). For M. curema, mean length at first spawning (L50) was 274 ± 9.3 and 278 ± 8.3 mm TL for both sexes respectively (corresponding to age 3). The minimum size of spawning for males and females was 280 and 299 mm TL, and 181 and 208 mm TL for M. cephalus and M. curema, respectively. Values for the gonadosomatic, liver fat deposit, and condition factor indices were determined.

This study was performed to further elucidate the mechanism of zinc-induced tolerance to cadmium cytotoxicity in a rat hepatic stellate cell line (CFSC-2G). Twenty four hours after seeding, cells were treated with 60 μmol/L ZnCl 2 for 24 h. Following zinc pretreatment, cells were exposed to 3 μmol/L and 5 μmol/L CdCl 2 for an additional 24 h. The toxicity of cadmium was significantly reduced in the zinc-pretreated cells. Zinc pretreatment produced a decrease in lipid peroxidation damage of cadmium-treated cells. Glutathione cell content diminished 33% and 43% as a result of 3 μmol/L and 5 μmol/L CdCl 2 treatment, respectively. Cell pretreatment with zinc recovered glutathione content at control cells level. Catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were also recovered to control values with zinc pretreatment. Cadmium (5 μmol/L) was able to induce 39% the expression of 1 collagen (I) gene after 1 h treatment, while zinc pretreatment prevented this cadmium pro-fibrogenic effect. We also examined the production of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) as a cellular response to oxidative stress produced by cadmium. By Western blot analysis, a 1.3 and 3 times increment in Hsp70, with 3 μmol/L and 5 μmol/L CdCl 2 treatment, respectively, was observed. Zinc pretreatment prevented the production of Hsp70. Metallothionein-II (MT-II) gene expression was induced by cadmium, but the induction was unaffected with zinc pretreatment. These data suggest that zinc-induced protection against the cytotoxicity of cadmium in stellate cells may be related to the maintenance of normal redox balance inside the cell.;Cd | glutathione | hepatic stellate cells | Hsp70 | Zn;35;0;;;;39618-M;

These were computed at an ab initio Hartree-Fock LANL1MB pseudopotentials level with an ONIOM-like space partition method. We validated our model comparing the work function (∼5.0eV), band gap (∼2.45eV) and density of states calculated in this work, with those values reported in literature. Using the concept of EUC, it was possible to suggest a qualitative macroscopic distribution of active sites on the macroscopic gold surface (100). We found that the electrophilic and nucleophilic active sites for this surface are preferably located on hollow positions and their density number is 1.6×1014sites/cm2 in both cases. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

For example, it induces the classic triad of effects attributable to these molecules: decrease in core temperature, hypolocomotion, and reduction in pain perception. However, as it binds to the cannabinoid receptors (CB1) only at high concentrations, it is not considered an actual endocannabinoid. In this study, we tested the effect of oleamide on food intake and sexual behavior and compared it to the effect induced by anandamide. Results indicate that oleamide and anandamide increased food intake during the 3 h post-injection. In addition, anandamide but not oleamide induced changes in sexual performance. This study further supports the role of endocannabinoids in food ingestion and male sexual behavior and gives additional support to the notion that, although oleamide might not be an endocannabinoid, it shares some effects with them. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The results confirmed the progestogenic activity of the three 19-nortestosterone derivatives, which decreases after reduction of the 4-ene-double bound. These compounds were able to activate AR-dependent reporter gene expression, LNG and GSD being the stronger activators. 5α-Reduction of LNG and GSD did not change their androgenic transcriptional activity; however, the activation of AR by 5α-NET was four-fold higher than NET. The highest selectivity transcriptional index, as a measure of progestogenicity versus androgenicity, was obtained for NET. The 5α-reduced derivatives had values significantly lower than those of their parent compounds.

Hence, for the Temalac peasants, there is no dissection, at an operative level, between ""natural facts"" (for instance, water availability) and personal or social ones, being these often considered as determinant for the quality and accessibility of resources and weather conditions.

Cd has been extensively studied in many cellular systems, but a lot of parameters have been evaluated in different experimental conditions. This study was undertaken to examine the effects of low cadmium concentrations in HepG2 cells in the oxidative stress produced, the IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), IL-6, and IL-8 expression, production of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and the activation of nuclear factors activation protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB under the same experimental conditions. Also, the participation of TNF-α and oxidative stress in AP-1 activation was evaluated. Lipid peroxidation damage increased 1.5 times after the first hour of Cd treatment and increased 1.9 times after 2h. Similar values were maintained until 6h. Reduced glutathione (GSH) diminished 65% after 6h CdCl 2 treatment. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) pre-treatment increased 332% GSH in Cd-treated cells. RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells after 0.5, 1, 3, or 6h incubation with 1, 5, or 10μM CdCl2. TNF-α and IL-1β presented a maximum response after 1h treatment, while IL-6 and IL-8 maximum response was after 3h treatment. The Hsp70, determined by Western blot, was constitutively produced, and it increased after 3h Cd treatment. NF-κB activation, determined by EMSA, was not increased as a result of Cd treatment. DNA binding of AP-1 was detected and increased, with time up to 4h with an increment of 24 times control value with 5μM CdCl2. The HepG2 cells were pretreated with anti-TNF-α antibody or 1mM N-acetylcysteine 1h before Cd treatment. Anti-TNF-α treatment reduced 67% AP-1 activation, while NAC 47.5%. These data indicate that, Cd-induced TNF-α and IL-1β, that probably, activate AP-1 transcription factor and IL-6 and IL-8 were induced. Anti-TNF-α and NAC partially inhibited AP-1 activation. All imply that, a number of factors participate in AP-1 cadmium-induced activation. The Hsp70 is produced by the HepG2 cells after cadmium treatment, and probably has a role in the non-participation of NF-κB in the cellular response. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Diverse configurations and parameters are evaluated to improve the system's response. The configuration producing less noise resulted when the biosensor was located closer to the auxiliary electrode, which also required coupling both electrodes within the system under a continuous flow regime. Further, we report on the influence of the active area of the biosensor and of the flow rate used. Statistical analyses of the data revealed two regions with a linear response range for the determination of β-D-glucose, with a detection limit of 4.7×10-4M and in the low concentration region a sensitivity of 17.46±0.12μAM-1. At the β-D-glucose concentrations studied there was no evidence of enzymatic saturation. An increment on the ionic strength of the sample and carrier passing through the analysis system decreases its sensitivity. The reproducibility of the analytical system in terms of its standard deviation was 2.9% with a 95% confidence level, having a lifetime that lasted at least 100 days. β-D-Glucose was determined in different commercial medical glucose-containing solutions, the experimental results are in good agreement with those reported by the manufacturer. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the effect of three different natural coatings, two based on mesquite gum mixed with candelilla wax and mineral oil (MCMO) at ratios of 2:1 and 1:1, and a third aqueous emulsion of candelilla wax with Tween60-Span60 were compared with a commercial wax on the post harvest life of Mexican limes. The limes were harvested at the beginning of June and again at the end of August, 2001, and stored at different temperatures (4,7,10 and 20°C, 90 ±2% R.H.). Chilling injury percentage, peel color, physiological weight loss percentage (%PWL), juice percentage, titratable acidity, and TSS were determined every three days by triplicate. No differences among treatments were found in TSS, juice percentage and titratable acidity. A synergistic effect was found on fruits treated with MCMO 1:1 formulation and stored at 10°C, showing less chilling injury, less percentage of PWL and a greener color. Significant differences were observed in the response of fruit harvested in both seasons, showing that the overall quality of early season limes were better.;Chilling injury tolerance | Cold storage | Fruit quality | Harvesting season | Postharvest | Storage temperature;3;0;;;;undefined;

SSF were carried out using a mixture of shrimp waste silage and sugar cane pith bagasse at initial pH of 6. The increment of moisture content and mycelia as inoculum in SSF improved the enzyme yield significantly and reduced the lag phase, i.e. 75% of moisture content inoculated with spores or mycelia produced 1016 and 1673 U/g IDS, respectively. SSF produced a higher β-N-acetylhexosaminidase yield than SF, but required a longer time (24 h). Specific activity in SSF was only 40% higher than SF, due to impurities from shrimp waste silage and sugar cane bagasse. Shrimp waste silage was an efficient inducer of the extracellular enzyme, compared with media supplemented with sucrose where enzymic activity was not detected. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrogen peroxide also increased α1B-adrenoceptor phosphorylation but to a lesser extent, in an ephemeral fashion, and only at high (millimolar) concentrations. The effect of peroxovanadate was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C such as staurosporine and rottlerin and only partially reduced by genistein and inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Protein kinase C α, δ and ε are associated with the α1B-adrenoceptor under basal conditions, as reflected by coimmunoprecipitation. Such association was increased by peroxovanadate for all isoforms. In contrast, hydrogen peroxide increased only the association of the ε isoform to the adrenoceptor. Peroxovanadate decreased the ability of noradrenaline to increase intracellular calcium, indicating that the receptor phosphorylation induced has functional consequences. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Individual plants were identified and labeled, to track their development through time and correlate annual production with environmental factors. Fruit development has been studied to establish a harvest index. Studies on firmness, respiration, physiological weight loss, extractable juice, °Brix, pH, titratable acidity and vitamin C, as well as reducing sugars and a proximal analysis were made to determine quality, postharvest handling and refrigerated storage potential. A commercial evaluation was also made to predict the economic value of this potential crop. Results indicated that the more young branches the plant has the more fruits it could produce. It is suggested that experiments in pruning should be undertaken as a next phase. Characterization of fruits was made to select the best varieties for establishment. °Brix showed to be the best parameter to determine time of harvest. The fruit loses its spines 24 hours after harvest. Vitamin C decreases from 14.5 mg to 2.5 mg during the storage period. Results of proximal analysis are shown for the three most common types of fruits found in the Region of La Mixteca, Oaxaca. Commercial analysis shows that fresh fruits are suitable for exploitation.;Alternative resource | Cactaceae products | Integrate system | Mexico;11;0;;;;undefined;

Mice immunized subcutaneously and a non treated control group were included. Other groups of mice were immunized intranasally with different EPEC strains and a non pathogenic E. coli K12 strain. Antibody response tested by ELISA assay showed that specific anti EPEC 0127:H6 antibodies were induced in serum by intra-nasal, subcutaneous and intragastric routes. A strong increase of antibody response against EPEC 0127:H6 strain was observed in saliva after intranasal delivery, while a lower response was detected by peroral and intrarectal immunization. Only the intranasal route increased IgA anti EPEC 0127:H6 antibody titers in feces. Specific and cross reactive antibodies to EPEC 0127:H6 were seen in mice immunized intranasally with different EPEC strains. Some control mice showed a background of anti EPEC 0127:H6 antibodies in feces. CT had a negative effect as adjuvant.

The venation pattern is brochidodromous with basal lateral veins. In nine of the 14 taxa the lateral loops become notably narrower in the distal portion (anisonerved loops). On the basis of primary vein size and width, and the nature of the loops, the taxa of the series are divided into two groups, one with isonerved loops and a notably thickened primary vein (massive) and the other with anisonerved loops and a stout or moderately thickened primary vein; the primary vein and secondary veins can be sinuate or straight. Idioblasts were observed in association with the ends of the veinlets. These are of three types: polymorphic sclereids, osteosclereids, and tracheoidal elements. Calcium oxalate prisms and druses are present in most taxa of the series. The first are associated with the vascular bundles, while druses are found in mesophyll cells.

This study was conducted to investigate the role of pericarp cell wall components as factors that contribute to MW resistance in nine genotypes of tropical maize. Six susceptibility parameters to MW were measured and related to cell wall components such as simple phenolic acids, diferulic acids (DiFAs), hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), and nutritional and physical traits. Weevil susceptibility was negatively correlated (P < 0.001) with total DiFAs (r = -0.77), HRGPs (r = -0.82), grain hardness (r = -0.87), pericarp/whole kernel (P/K) ratio (r = -0.68), and pericarp thickness (r = -0.86). A detailed analysis of phenolics indicated the presence of trans-ferulic acid (FA), p-coumaric acid (CA), and four isomers of DiFA. The most prominent were 5,5́-DiFA, 8-O-4-DiFA, and 8,5́-DiFA benzofuran form (DiFAb). On the basis of regression models, 5,5́-DiFA, 8-O-4-DiFA, trans-FA, and p-CA were the most important phenolic components of resistance. Grain hardness was correlated (P < 0.001) with cell wall bound HRGPs (r = 0.61) and DiFAs (r = 0.75). Cell wall cross-linking components could contribute to MW resistance by fortification of the pericarp cell wall as well as increase grain hardness. This structurally based mechanism should be considered in the development of hybrids and varieties where storage pests are prevalent.;;103;0;;;;undefined;

The model specifically evaluates the consequences of introducing variable costs and benefits of tolerance and resistance and nonlinear cost-and-benefit functions for tolerance and resistance. Incorporating these assumptions, the present model of plant defense predicts different evolutionary scenarios, not expected by previous work. Basically, the presence of an adaptive peak corresponding to intermediate levels of allocation to tolerance and resistance can arise when the shape parameter of the cost function is higher than the corresponding of the benefit function. The presence of two alternatives peaks of maximum tolerance and maximum resistance occurs only when benefits of tolerance and resistance interact less than additive. Finally, the presence of one peak of maximum resistance or maximum tolerance depends on the relative values of the magnitude of costs for tolerance and resistance. An important outcome of our model is that under a plausible set of conditions, variable costs of tolerance and resistance can represent an important aspect involved in the maintenance of intermediate levels of tolerance and resistance, and in favoring adaptive divergence in plant defensive strategies among populations. The model offers a framework for future theoretical and empirical work toward understanding spatial variation in levels of allocation to different defensive strategies.;Evolutionary stable strategy | Host-pathogen interaction | Plant-herbivore interaction | Resistance | Tolerance;77;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Results showed that dental impresion material prepared with sodium alginate with extra low viscosities (S1 = 58 mPa s) and low viscosities (S2 = 145 m Pa s) did not form gels, the material prepared with medium viscosity (S3 = 506 mPa s) produced a gel type II (regular set) in 70% of the 10 formulations experimented, and the material prepared with potassium alginate with extra low viscosity (P1 = 48 mPa s) produced a gel type II in 90% of the formulations. Using potassium alginate with low viscosity (P2 = 155 mPa s), 90% of the formulations were type I (fast set), and using potassium alginate with medium viscosity (P3 = 200 mPa s), 80% of the formulations were type I. The highest compressive strength was obtained using sodium alginate of 506 mPa s and the three potassium alginates experimented at 25% concentration, with values of 2474, 1209, 2101 and 2124 g cm-2 for S3, P1, P2 and P3 alginates, respectively. The elasticity order of formulation with 25% alginates compared with a commercial product (Jeltrate®) was as follows: Jeltrate® > P2 > S3 > P3 > P1. It was concluded that S3, P1, P2 and P3 alginates have good potential for use in the production of dental impression materials.;Algae | Alginates | Dental impression material | Macrocystis pyrifera;7;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

We analyzed 19 morphometric, 8 meristic, and 11 purarive enzyme-coding loci from C. grandocule samples from two different localiries within the lake during three differenr years (Janitzio 1996, 1999, and Ichupio 1997). Because morphomerric attributes were all correlated, scores derived from reciprocal averaging analysis were used to describe the variation in fish morphology. Discriminant analysis using 10 morphometric and 8 meristic variables revealed significant differences between samples (Janitzio and Ichupio, X2 = 558.4 and 531.5, P < 0.001, respectively). The utilization of morphometric features for the reclassification of organisms into the site of origin was highly effective (x̄ = 98.2%). Allozyme data resolved seven polymorphic loci (P0.99) and levels of heterocigosis that ranged from 0.0134 ro 0.0319 (x̄ He = 0.0234). Weir and Cockerham's F-statistics provided evidence of low but significant heterogeneity between sites and years (jackknifed θs = 0.0252, SD = 0.0126); a pairwise comparison of θs values revealed that the sample from Ichupio was highly disrinct compared ro the samples from Janitzio (0.0400 vs. 0.0033, P < 0.05), indicating intra-lacustrine differentiation between the north and south samples. Genetic co-ancestry distances between samples ranged from 0.0154 to 0.0341. The genetic and morphometric variarion detected in C. grandocule's samples are discussed in the light of differences in sex ratio and of the contrasted environmental and physio-geographical intra-lacusrrine conditions.";Chirostoma grandocule | Genetic differentiation | Lake pátzcuaro | México;9;0;;;;undefined;

On the mainland, there is considerable morphological variability involving robustness, branching pattern, and size and shape of receptacles. A latitudinal cline is not evident. By contrast, there is relatively little morphological variability among populations in the Channel Islands of southern California and coastal islands of northern Baja California. These insular populations are perceptibly distinct from all mainland populations except for several in northern Baja California. After comparing populations from various parts of the range of the species, including all coastal islands, we conclude that two subspecies may be recognized. In subsp. compressa, which occurs only on the mainland, the frond is robust and straggly, with dichotomous branching that tends to be irregular, and with linear receptacles often tapered to a point. In the newly described subsp. deliquescens, which is chiefly insular but also occurs on the coast of northern Baja California, the fronds form hemispherical clumps, with densely and regularly branched slender axes and short, blunt, ellipsoidal receptacles. A few populations on the Monterey Peninsula in which the fronds are unusually delicate were described by Setchell and Gardner as f. gracilis, to which was assigned a population from Santa Catalina Island. We conclude that the Monterey Peninsula populations of f. gracilis constitute an ecotype of subsp. compressa, whereas the Santa Catalina Island population is referable to subsp. deliquescens. Comparison of nucleotide sequences from the ITS regions of rDNA revealed no molecular differentiation in populations of subsp. compressa from Baja California and central California, including those assignable to f. gracilis. The sequence in the three populations of subsp. deliquescens was identical, but differed by 2 bp (0.3%) from that of subsp. compressa.;;5;0;;;;undefined;

Immobilization stress (IMB) induces an increase of both rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep (SWS). It has been suggested that these changes are mediated in part by noradrenaline and by the corticotrophin releasing factor. Objective: To determine the participation of mu receptors in the stress-induced increase of REM sleep using naltrexone (NTX). Methods: Twelve adult male rats were implanted for sleep recordings. Subjects were recorded under control conditions as well as after: a) IMB stress (1 h); b) injection of NTX (1.5 mg/ kg); c) NTX plus IMB. To assess corticosterone levels, additional groups (n=5) were decapitated at 0, 1, 3 and 6 h after vehicle injection and after immobilization. Four groups were decapitated at 0, 1, 3, and 6 h after NTX plus IMB. Corticosterone plasma levels were determined by HPLC. Results: IMB induces an increase in REM and SWS, and a decrease in wakefulness. Administration of NTX before IMB suppresses the effects of stress on sleep. NTX administration is innocuous in non-stressed animals. However, NTX administration does not prevent the rise of corticosterone normally observed after IMB stress. Conclusion: These data suggest that NTX prevents the effects of IMB stress on sleep by acting outside of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that partially mediates the stress response.";Corticosterone | Naltrexone | Opioid receptors | Sleep | Stress;15;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

This total includes about 40% of the total extent of coastal wetlands in Mexico. It is possible to recognize four distinct groups of wetlands based largely on the salinity gradients: oligohaline (0-10 ppt), estuarine (10-30 ppt), euhaline (30-40 ppt), and hyperhaline (>40 ppt). Estuarine wetlands are the most abundant and widespread group. Oligohaline wetlands are more common in the south and the hyperhaline wetlands are more common along the north coasts of Mexico. Euhaline systems are in specialized localities scattered along both coasts. Human activities and development pressures continue to threaten the coastal wetlands in Mexico. This paper presents the first survey of ecological characteristics of the coastal wetlands in Mexico. These data highlight the range of variability that exists, demonstrates problems such as eutrophication, and provides a basis for future more detailed biomonitoring, management and conservation programs for these highly vulnerable and economically important ecosystems in Mexico.;Ecosystem productivity | Mangroves | Mexico | Wetland management | Wetlands;40;0;;;;undefined;

Previous studies have reported the effect of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules in the immune response regulation of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and the association of HLA antigens with heart damage. We studied the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (HLA-A and HLA-B), and class II (HLA-DR) genes in a sample of 66 serologically positive individuals with and without cardiomyopathy, and in 127 healthy controls. The total group of seropositive individuals revealed increased frequencies of HLA-B39 (pc = 4.3×10-5, odds ratio [OR] = 3.35) and DR4 (pc = 1.8×10-5, OR = 2.91) when compared to healthy controls. Increased frequencies of HLA-A68 and HLA-B39 were found in asymptomatic individuals when compared to patients with cardiomyopathy (pc = 0.014, OR = 4.99 and pc = 0.001, OR = 4.46, respectively). Also, patients with cardiomyopathy exhibited increased frequency of HLA-B35 when compared to healthy controls (pc = 0.048, OR = 2.56). The HLA-DR16 frequency was increased in patients with cardiomyopathy compared with asymptomatic individuals (pc = 0.05, OR = No determined) and healthy controls (pc = 0.02, OR = 5.0). The results suggest that MHC alleles might be associated with the development of chronic infection and with heart damage in Chagas' disease. HLA-DR4 and HLA-B39 could be associated directly with the infection by T. cruzi, whereas, HLA-DR16 could be marker of susceptibility to heart damage and HLA-A68 might confer protection to develop cardiomyopathy. © American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics, 2004.

Such physical changes may lead to the release of entrapped flavours. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of storage temperature and water activity on caking, stickiness and glass transition temperatures and to evaluate the relative degree of protection provided to orange peel oil entrapped in mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) gum by spray drying. The powders were stored at water activities (aw) ranging from 0.108 to 0.972 at 25 and 35°C. The surface caking temperature (Tsc) and advance caking temperature (Tac) were determined by the modified ampoule and sealed glass tube methods respectively. The glass transition temperature was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Changes in the amount of encapsulated oil were determined by Clevenger hydrodistillation. As expected, both Tsc and T ac decreased with increasing storage aw. Above a w 0.628 the powders caked and collapsed during storage at 35°C. Below aw 0.628 the capsules were not damaged and high retention levels (above 90%) were obtained. Increasing aw in the range 0.743-0.972 caused progressive dissolution of the wall polymer, and the retention level dropped sharply. The volatiles are protected and retained by mesquite gum as long as the capsule structure remains intact. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.;Glass transition | Mesquite gum (Prosopis juliflora) | Microencapsulation | Storage temperature | Water activity;19;0;;;;undefined;

However, the endocrine changes induced by this treatment are controversial. In the present study, we analyzed the levels of corticosterone and testosterone in rats neonatally treated with CMI in response to chronic stress by repeated immersion in cold water. Results obtained in the forced swim test corroborated the effect of neonatal CMI administration, showing a significant increase in immobility time. The testosterone response to stress was similar in both control and CMI-treated rats. Concerning corti-costerone, there was a significantly lower response to stress in CMI-treated rats. The data suggest that CMI induces permanent changes in the reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, without affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Copyright © 2003 S.

These species grow and reproduce under conditions of disturbance; they are occasionally browsed by goats and used for firewood. The effect of temperature on germination, the longevity of the seeds in the field, and the germination potential of seeds parasitized by insects of the family Bruchidae were tested. It was found that the seeds require scarification to germination. The optimum temperature for seed germination of M. similis, M. lacerata, and M. depauperata was between 20°C and 35°C and for M. texana var. texana between 30°C and 35°C. The species germinated just as well beneath the canopy as in open areas in the field. The seeds of each species are parasitized by bruchids of the genus Acanthocelides spp., and seed infestation necessarily had a detrimental effect. The seeds in the seed bank lose their longevity at a rate of 20-73% per year. As with other legumes, Mimosa seeds have a tough seed coat, which influences germination, longevity, and susceptibility to predation by bruchids. The results form this study contribute to an understanding of the phases of germination and the longevity of the seeds of Mimosa in the seed bank in arid and semi-arid communities. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Studies of cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women have shown a variety of responses according to the molecular structure of the progestin used in hormone replacement therapy schemes. The present study sets out to determine the vasoactive effects of norethisterone and its 5α-dihydro (5α-norethisterone) and -tetrahydro (3α,5α-norethisterone and 3β,5α -norethisterone) metabolites in isolated precontracted rat thoracic aorta. The addition of norethisterone and 3α,5α-norethisterone in rat aorta exhibited a potent, concentration-response inhibition of noradrenaline-induced contraction, while 5α- and 3β,5α-norethisterone had very little, if any, vasorelaxing effect. Relaxation to norethisterone and 3α,5α-norethisterone had very rapid time-courses and it was neither affected by the absence of endothelium nor by the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, Nω̄-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). The addition of specific anti-androgen, anti-progestin and anti-estrogen compounds and protein synthesis inhibitors did not preclude the vasorelaxing effect of norethisterone and its 3α,5α-reduced metabolite. The results strongly suggest that these effects are not mediated by nuclear sex steroid hormone receptors.

The first objective was to evaluate the microbiota of the rotifer during intensive production and to obtain sterile rotifer cultures starting from adult females or amictic eggs using PVP-Iodine, Hydrogen peroxide or antibiotic mixtures. In the rotifers, the proportion of vibrios increased significantly during the mass production, displacing other unidentified marine bacteria. Rotifers, in the absence of culturable bacteria were obtained starting from amictic eggs and using Trimetroprim-sulfametoxasole (Bactrim Roche®) at 10 ml 1-1. The effect of members of Vibrionaceae on the survival and growth rate of rotifers was determined under monoxenic conditions. The survival of rotifers was not affected in the presence of different isolates, while amictic egg formation occurred and the populations increased when the strains Vibrio proteolyticus C279 and Aeromonas media C226 were tested. All isolates were successfully incorporated in the rotifers, since there was no significant difference between the numbers of bioencapsulated cells of different strains of isolates. The results show that it is possible to replace the microbial community in rotifer cultures, started from disinfected amictic eggs, with selected bacterial strains. This could be used as a tool for future studies to reveal the role of specific bacteria on first larval stages of marine fish species.;Bioencapsulation | Gnotobiotic rotifers | Rotifer microbiota | Vibrionaceae;24;0;;;;undefined;National Research Council of Science and Technology

Although antibiotics are the best known secondary metabolites (SM), there are others with an enormous range of other biological activities mainly in fields like: pharmaceutical and cosmetics, food, agriculture and farming. These include compounds with anti-inflammatory, hypotensive, antitumour, anticholesterolemic activities, and also insecticides, plant growth regulators and environmental friendly herbicides and pesticides. These compounds are usually produced by liquid submerged fermentation, but some of these metabolites could be advantageously produced by solid-state fermentation. Today, strain improvement can be performed by two alternative strategies, each having distinct advantages, and in some cases all these approaches can be used in concert to increase production such as classical genetic methods with mutation and random selection or rational selection (including genetic recombination); and molecular genetic improvement methods. The latter can be applied by: amplification of SM biosynthetic genes, inactivation of competing pathways, disruption or amplification of regulatory genes, manipulation of secretory mechanisms and expression of a convenient heterologous protein. It is visualized that in the near future, genomics will also be applied to industrial strain improvement.";Classical and molecular genetic improvement | New activities | Secondary metabolites;55;0;;;;undefined;

The hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) hearts showed a decrease in the mechanical work and slight diminution in the oxygen uptake when perfused with glucose, pyruvate or lactate. No differences were found when perfused with palmitate, octanoate or β-hydroxybutyrate. The glycolytic flux in HTG hearts was 2.4 times lower than in control hearts. Phosphofructokinase-I (PFK-I was 16% decreased in HTG hearts, whereas pyruvate kinase activity did not change. The increased levels of glucose-6-phosphate in HTG heart, suggested a flux limitation by the PFK-I. Pyruvate dehydrogenase in its active form (PDHa) diminished as well. The PDHa level in the HTG hearts was restored to control values by dichloroacetate; however, this addition did not significantly improve the mechanical performance. Levels of ATP and phosphocreatine as well as total creatine kinase activity and the MB fraction were significant lower in the HTG hearts perfused with glucose.

Cytoskeleton in neurodegenerative diseases is characterized by hyperphosphorylated tau assembled in neurofibrillary tangles. Tau protein promotes microtubule enlargement and its hyperphosphorylation inhibits tubulin assembly. Okadaic acid (OA) causes oxidative stress, tau hyperphosphorylation, and altered cytoskeletal organization similar to those observed in neurons of patients with dementia. Since melatonin acts by both enlarging microtubules and as a free-radical scavenger, in this work we studied the effects of melatonin on altered cytoskeletal organization induced by OA in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Optic microscopy, morphometric analysis, and tubulin immunofluorescence staining of neuroblastoma cells incubated with 50 nM OA showed an intact microtubule network following the neurite profile similar to that observed in the vehicle-incubated cells when melatonin was added to the incubation media 2 h before OA. The melatonin effects on altered cytoskeletal organization induced by OA were dose-dependent and were not abolished by luzindole, the mt1 melatonin antagonist receptor. Also, increased lipid peroxidation and augmented apoptosis in N1E-115 cells incubated with 50 nM OA were prevented by melatonin. The results support the hypothesis that melatonin can be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Griseb. & H. Wendl., Sabal mexicana Mart, and Sabal yapa Wright ex Becc., three of the four most representative species of the Yucatán Península, in Mexico. These species are locally used: in the roofing of traditional homes, as food (fruits and apical buds), and in the production of hats, brooms and handicrafts. Leaf samples were collected in secondary growth of lower montane rainforest in the state of Quintana Roo and in two home gardens in the state of Yucatán. Herbarium samples were obtained, and samples of blade and petiole were fixed in formaline-acetic acid-alcohol. Cross incisions were made on the blade and petiole, and were dyed with safranin and toluidine blue O. The results show that S. mauritiiformis and S. yapa are morphologically alike: both are tall, slim palm trees; the leaf in S. mauritiiformis is a shorter palm-like structure compared with the other two species. The shape of the main nerve, as seen in cross section, is rectangular in the three species. The hastula in the three species is acuminate and adaxial. The foliar anatomic structure is similar in the three species, although there are some differences. The adaxial an abaxial epidermis of the blade consist of one layer and, superficially, the anticlinal walls are straight; the stomata are intercostal, of the tetracytic type, present on both surfaces in S. mexicana and S. yapa and only on the abaxial surface on S. mauritiiformis. The hypodermis is one layer thick in S. yapa and in S. mexicana and two layers thick in S. mauritiiformis. In the three species the palisade parenchyma consists of several undefined strata as the cells are similar -in shape and size- to the cells in the spongy parenchyma, so there is no marked difference between these strata and the spongy parenchyma seems almost continuous. Both fibrous and vascular bundles are distributed between the hypodermis and the palisade parenchyma; the fiber bundles can be found towards the abaxial surface while the vascular and fiber bundles are located towards the adaxial surface. The fibers, in the three species, are elongated, with the pointed tips, undivided and unseptated. One to three wide vessels of metaxilem can be seen in the vascular bundles, those in S. yapa being the widest in diameter. The vascular bundles are surrounded by thick fiber sheaths which come in pairs. The anatomic structure of the petiole is similar to that of the blade, and is characterized by the many vascular and fiber bundles dispersed in the parenchymatous tissue, and which are very resistant. The histological structure of the blade and petiole reflects strength and flexibility, qualities which make these plants adequate in the construction of roofs for rural housing and other buildings.";Foliar anatomy | Mexico | Palms | Quintana Roo | Sabal | Tropical rain forest | Uses | Yucatán;9;0;;;;undefined;

Former putative intron/ exon structures from genomic DNA are fully confirmed by match analysis with our cDNA sequences. Using Polymerase Chain Reaction - Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis, an additional laccase cDNA was also identified, corresponding to a new gene, lcc1A, which displayed 99.6% identity with lcc1 at protein level.

Spatial heterogeneity related to the occurrence of Mimosa species results in temporal differences in AM-fungal spore numbers and soil nutrients. A higher number of AM-fungal spores were found in the soil below the canopies of six endemic Mimosa species than in the soil from non-vegetated areas. For four species, Mimosa adenantheroides, Mimosa calcicola, Mimosa luisana and Mimosa polyantha, the soil below their canopies had more AM-fungal spores than the soil in non-vegetated areas during the wet season than during the dry season. Two species, Mimosa lacerata and Mimosa texana var. filipes, however, had more spores under their canopies during the dry season than during the wet season. Although physical differences are present within and between sites, in general the soil below the canopies of Mimosa species had significantly higher nutrient levels than the soil from non-vegetated areas. Mimosa species thus form ""resource islands"" that are not only rich in nutrients but also in mycorrhizal propagules. Mimosa species can serve as mycorrhizal ""resource islands"" by directly affecting AM-fungal spore dynamics and/or by serving as spore-traps. A range of plants associated with Mimosa species may benefit from the higher number of AM propagules. We believe that the use of Mimosa resource islands as an option for biodiversity conservation and for land restoration ought to be considered in the Valley.";Arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungi | Conservation | Resource island | Seasonality | Semiarid;58;0;;;CONACYT;112386;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

We quantified all bromeliads considering their size (height and basal diameter), as well as their spatial orientation considering height from the ground, the distance to the center of the tree, and orientation on the host tree. At the 'Izotal', the epiphytes on Beaucarnea gracilis (Nolinaceae) exhibited a clumped distribution pattern. Whereas in the 'Cardonal', epiphytes use columnar cacti (Cephalocereus columna trajani) for support, are more scarce, exhibit smaller size (height), and fewer number of clumps. The distribution of T. dasyliriifolia and T. califanii is influenced by the distribution of their two main hosts, while T. recurvata might be randomly distributed. The distribution of Tillandsia individuals on Beaucarnea plants was quite characteristic: (i) T. recurvata was mostly SW oriented, on the lower strata (2.50-3.59 m) and very close (0-0.59 cm) to the center of the phorophyte; (ii) T. dasyliriifolia was mostly SE oriented, on the low strata, and close to the center of the phorophyte (0.60-1.19 m); and (iii) T. califanii was mostly NE oriented, on low strata, and very close to the center of the phorophyte.

Some possible mechanisms of the action of doxorubicin have been postulated, but the initial gene deregulation response has not been investigated. Fetal life stages are critical periods in mammalian oogenesis. This study analyzes gene expression alterations in mouse fetal oocytes exposed in vitro to this anticancer agent. cDNA libraries were generated from isolated fetal oocytes and differential screenings performed with cDNAs from in vitro doxorubicin-treated and -untreated oocytes. Differentially expressed genes were assessed by real-time RT-PCR to quantify the extent of their transcriptional control in doxorubicin-exposed oocytes. The results show that doxorubicin alters the expression of genes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, intracellular transport and cell differentiation. Finally, the up-regulation of a differentially expressed gene (metaxin) mediated by its promoter was evaluated in a functional assay. When treated with doxorubicin, somatic cells transfected with a genetic construct including the promoter of metaxin and a reporter gene showed increases in expression similar to those observed in fetal oocytes. This demonstrates the direct effect of agent on the regulation of a specific gene. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The gametangia are of the type typical for leptosporangiate ferns. Gametophytes of all species initially become female, then bisexual. Differences among species include spore germination time (6-12 days), shape of the gametophytes (spatulate-cordiform to cordiform-reniform, with smooth to very irregular margins), development time of trichomes (12-24 days), and appearance of gametangia (40-200 days). Some species develop the first leaves of the sporophytes after 200 days. Results are contrasted with previously published reports on gametophyte development in Arachniodes Blume, Cyrtomium C.

For initial benzene concentrations of 0, 7, and 10 mg/L, the specific rates of NO3--N production were 0.545 ± 0.101, 0.306 ± 0.024, and 0.141 ± 0.010 g NO3--N/g microbial protein-N·h, respectively.

Up to a concentration of 10 mg/L, benzene was first oxidized to phenol, which was later totally oxidized to acetate. Benzene at higher concentrations (20 and 30 mg/L) was converted to intermediates other than acetate, phenol, or catechol.

In the female-dominant lethal phase, females treated with EPBL were caged with untreated males. The above dosages and schedule treatments were used. The incidence of pregnancy of females mated on days 1-7 and 8-14 after males were given 200 mg/kg of EPBL and of females given 200 mg/kg when mated to untreated males was decreased. Upon examining surgically exposed uteri and ovaries of pregnant females during the first phase, on gestation days 13-15, an increased incidence of pre-implantation losses with 200 mg/kg of EPBL and an increased incidence of post-implantation losses with 100 and 200 mg/kg was observed. In addition, an increased frequency of pre- and post-implantation losses was seen in females treated with 200 mg/kg.

Several conditions for the application of 1-MCP including concentrations (100, 300 and 1000 nl 1-1), temperatures (14 and 20°C) and durations of exposure (6, 12 and 24 h) were studied. In some experiments, bananas at ripeness stage 3 or 4 that were treated with 1000 nl 1-1 1-MCP at 20°C for 6 or 24 h had higher ethylene production rates but respiration rates were reduced and changes in skin color and flesh firmness were delayed without negative impacts on the qualitative or quantitative aroma composition of the fruit. However, similar 1-MCP treatments were much less effective in retarding ripening of stage 3 or 4 bananas in subsequent experiments.

When applied to the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of non-copulating male rats kindling induces masculine sexual behavior. In order to test if kindling could facilitate male-like coital behavior in female rats, sexually naive females were ovariectomized and kindled in the amygdala (AMG) or the MPOA until an intermediate stage (between 1 and 3, MPOA1-3) or until stage 5 (MPOA5 group). Once kindling was established, females were treated with 2.5 mg/Kg of testosterone propionate (TP) for 15 days. Male-like coital behavior was evaluated on days 5, 10 and 15 of treatment. Subjects were then injected with a TP dose of 5 mg/kg for 15 days and tested in the same way as with the lower dose. The number of mounts was significantly increased and the mount latency was significantly reduced in the MPOA1-3 group when tested 5 days after treatment with the low dose of TP. The same facilitation was observed in MPOA1-3 and MPOA5 groups on day 10 of treatment with the low dose of TP. When the animals were under the high dose of TP treatment, the number of intromissions was increased in all experimental groups (including the AMG kindled group) in comparison to sham animals. In a second experiment we evaluated if the facilitation of male-like coital behavior induced by kindling was produced by a modification of the response of the vomeronasal system to sexually relevant cues. Ovariectomized females were stimulated until they reached kindling stage 2, then they were treated with 2.5 mg/kg of TP for 5 days. After animals were exposed for 90 min to clean sawdust or sawdust soiled by estrous females they were perfused. Fos was detected by immunocytochemistry along the vomeronasal pathway. No differences were found in Fos responses between sham and MPOA kindled females. The facilitation of masculine sexual behavior observed in AMG kindled females may be a consequence of the propagation of the AD to other brain regions involved in the expression of masculine sexual behavior. We propose that masculine sexual behavior is facilitated in MPOA kindled female rats by local neural changes produced by this kind of stimulation without modifying the response of the vomeronasal system to sexually relevant cues. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

These changes are very important for gamete recognition and fertilization in mammals but are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of surface carbohydrates in boar spermatozoa during capacitation and the AR. These processes may be associated with specific changes in the content and distribution of surface carbohydrates. Thirty-nine ejaculates from fertile boars of various breeds were analyzed. N-Acetylglucosamine and sialic acid, mannose and fucose residues were detected by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated lectins. Triticum vulgaris agglutinin (WGA) bound on the head and tail of fresh sperm, and fluorescence intensity (FI) decreased in capacitated sperm (6751 to 5621 fluorescence units (FU), P < 0.05), and decreased further in acrosome-reacted sperm (5240 FU, P < 0.05). Concanavalia ensiformis agglutinin (Con-A) bound homogeneously on the head and the midpiece of fresh sperm with a FI of 5335 FU, and increased in capacitated sperm (5957 FU, P < 0.05) mainly on the acrosomal region. In acrosome-reacted sperm, fluorescence was concentrated on the border of the acrosomal region (5608 FU, P < 0.05). It was not possible to detect Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA) by fluorescence microscopy. However, flow cytometry revealed UEA receptors (187 FU), with a nonsignificant decreased number in capacitated (142 FU) and AR sperm (142 FU). Labeling patterns were similar in all breeds. Sperm glycocalyx modifications observed in this study provide insights to the molecular modifications accompanying capacitation and the AR.

In rats, it has been shown that male sexual behavior has a direct influence on sleeping patterns, increasing slow wave sleep (SWS) duration. On the other hand, the sexual behavior pattern of the male Golden hamster differs from the copulatory pattern of male rats. Male hamsters copulate faster and they do not display the motor inhibition observed in rats after each ejaculation. Moreover, close to exhaustion, hamsters display a behavioral pattern known as Long Intromission, which has been linked to an sexual inhibitory process. The present study was performed to determine the effects of male sexual activity on the sleep pattern in hamsters. Subjects were allowed to copulate for 30 and 60min. In addition, the effect of locomotor activity was also assessed. The results show that male sexual behavior induced a significant increase of SWS II, with a reduction of wakefulness. No effect was observed on REM sleep. Locomotor activity produced only a slight effect on sleep. The results are discussed in terms of the similarities between the effects observed after sexual behavior on sleep in rats and hamsters, despite the substantial differences in the behavioral pattern. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of storing diluted porcine semen (during 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days) on the sperm membranes status and the ability of sperm to respond to in vitro capacitation treatment. Ten semen samples from 5 adult boars were analyzed. Two aliquots were obtained from the sperm-rich fraction: one was used to assess fresh semen and the other was diluted in Reading extender and stored at 16°C. Both semen samples were stained with chlortetracycline to assess the status of sperm membranes and with Hoechst 33258 to determine viability. Semen storage for 4-8 days increased the proportion of prematurely capacitated sperm. After 4 days of storage, in vitro capacitation treatment did not increase the percentage of capacitated sperm, but increased the percentage of acrosome reacted sperm. This phenomenon could explain the reduced fertilizing ability of porcine semen stored at 16°C for over 4 days, in spite of the acceptable sperm viability and progressive motility.;Acrosome reaction | Boar sperm | Capacitation | Chlortetracycline | Long-term extenders | Membrane status | Semen preservation;11;0;;;;undefined;

This antagonistic relationship between both these axes has been proposed to underlie the inhibition of reproductive function due to stress. Sexual behavior in males may be the most vulnerable aspect of male reproduction to acute and chronic stress and it has been suggested that alterations in sexual behavior during stress are due to the antagonistic relationship between testosterone and corticosteroids. However, only in a few studies has a correlation between the levels of testosterone and corticosterone, and sexual behavior been made. In this study, we evaluated the effects of different stressors, applied both acute and chronically, on masculine sexual behavior and whether or not these effects on sexual behavior are accompanied by changes in plasma levels of corticosterone and testosterone. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of testosterone treatment on the effects of stress on sexual behavior. Sexually experienced male rats were exposed to one of the following stressors: immobilization (IMB), electric foot shocks (EFS) or immersion in cold water (ICW). Sexual behavior and plasma levels of testosterone and corticosterone were assessed on days 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 of stress. In a second experiment, males were castrated, treated with 3 different doses of testosterone propionate (TP) and exposed to ICW for 20 consecutive days. Sexual behavior was assessed on days 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 and steroids were evaluated on day 20. Parameters of masculine sexual behavior were modified depending on the characteristics of each stressor. Mount, intromission and ejaculation latencies increased significantly, the number of mounts increased, and ejaculations decreased significantly in males exposed to EFS and to ICW but not in males exposed to IMB. Associated with these effects, testosterone decreased in the EFS and ICW groups on days 1, 15, and 20. However, corticosterone increased only in males exposed to ICW. In castrated males, TP treatment failed to block the effects of stress by ICW on sexual behavior and corticosterone. These results indicate that the effects of stress on sexual behavior depend on the characteristics of each stressor, and these effects, as well as the decrease in testosterone are not necessarily associated with the increase in corticosterone.

We analysed the patterns of presence/absence of M. pectinifera in relation to the presence/absence of 48 other plant species, and the variation of environmental factors in 120 sampling plots. A Principal Components Analysis revealed a clear segregation between plots with and without individuals of M. pectinifera. A classification analysis resulted in four groups: two with low prevalence and two with high prevalence of M. pectinifera. Paired comparisons between plots with and without M. pectinifera allowed the characterization of its patterns of occurrence related to the variation of environmental factors. M. pectinifera was found on deep alkaline soils with relatively high surface stoniness and high water retention capacity, showing low species richness compared with plots where it was absent. The limited distribution of M. pectinifera in the Tehuacán Valley seems to be related to particular requirements of this species, being restricted to certain suitable habitat patches. Nevertheless, it is likely that other aspects, such as poor dispersal and establishment abilities, or biotic interactions could be associated with the observed patterns.;Habitat specificity | Rare species | Serotiny | Tehuacán Valley | Tropical Mexico;26;0;;;;undefined;

Chitosan at 2.0% and 3.0% had a fungicidal effect on C. gloeosporioides. Extracts alone did not show any fungicidal effect while the combination of 2. 5% chitosan with all the tested extracts had a fungistatic rather than fungicidal effect. Changes in the conidial morphology of C. gloeosporioides were observed with 1.5% chitosan concentration after 7h incubation. For in situ studies, control of anthracnose disease was obtained with 1.5% chitosan applied before C. gloeosporioides inoculation. Phomopsis was most frequently isolated from the non-inoculated fruit. Chitosan applications did not influence the content of total solid solubles or percentage weight loss during the storage of papaya fruit. However, there was a tendency toward greater firmness in fruit treated with the papaya seed extract alone or combined with chitosan. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.;Carica papaya | Colletotrichum gloeosporioides | Custard apple extract | Natural compounds | Papaya extract;227;0;;;;undefined;

The experiments were done under forced convection, with water as the working fluid, and constant heat transfer rate at the surface of the pipes. The tubes were of 0.019 m diameter but different longitudes. An electric resistance was wrapped around the tube to provide the flow of heat. The temperature measurement was done with type K thermocouples. A constant load tank provides the necessary pressure for the fluid to flow at constant rate. The results obtained in the tested equipment are within the range of ± 15% from the numerical results found in the literature, thus corroborating the reliability of the equipment.;Entrance region of a pipe | Heat transfer | Laminar flow | Thermal convection coefficient;0;0;;;;undefined;

The optimum gamete ratio for good fertilization and hatching rate ranged from 8490 to 23 672 spermatozoa per egg, when dechlorinated tap water was used. Optimal ratio between eggs (weight in g) and AS (in ml) was defined as 1:1 to 1:2. Different concentrations of AS such as NaCl from 0 to 34 mM (0-68 mOsmol kg-1) did not change fertilization and hatching rates. An AS adopted for carp spermatozoa (45 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) was compared with other saline AS; only the 51 mM (102 mOsmol kg-1) NaCl solution decreased fertilization and hatching rate. The AS containing 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 9 increased fertilization and hatching rates compared to dechlorinated tap water of pH 7 or to AS of pH 6 and 7. Adhesiveness from the eggs was successfully removed by incubation in Alcalase DX (PLN 04715) using two successive steps with different enzyme concentrations. The first step with an enzyme concentration of 2 ml 1-1 was applied from 8 to 20 min after fertilization. Later in a second step, the best time for application of alcalase enzyme at a concentration of 20 ml 1-1 was for 45 and 60 s at 20 min after fertilization leading to fertilization and hatching rates of 80-87%. The α-Chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1. Merck) was also found effective for elimination of stickiness. Results with α-Chymotrypsin enzyme indicate that the response to success in elimination of stickiness is highly variable mainly due to differences in the environment, quality of water and carp strains. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS and Infremer/IRD/Inra/Cemagref.

Alterations of hormonal responses to stressful situations have also been reported. In this study, the levels of corticosterone and testosterone in response to sexual activity were assessed in rats treated neonatally with CMI. Male pups received subcutaneous injections of CMI (15 mg/kg, 0.1 ml), twice a day (09.00 hours and 18.00 hours) from 8 to 21 days of age. A control group received saline in the same number of injections. Four months after CMI treatment, subjects (Ss) were submitted to the forced swim test to verify the effect of CMI. Thereafter, they were tested to assess their spontaneous sexual activity. Plasma levels of corticosterone and testosterone were assessed under different conditions. Results of sexual behavior and the forced swim test corroborate the depressive-like effect of CMI. The sole presence of an estrogenized stimulus female caused an increase in plasma levels of testosterone in both control and CMI-treated Ss. The same was true for corticosterone; however, this increase was significantly lower in the CMI-treated group. There is a discrepancy between the normal hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) response and the decreased sexual behavior. The data suggest that CMI induces permanent changes in the reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. © 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.";Animal models of depression | Corticosterone | Forced swim test | Neonatal clomipramine | Rat | Sexual behavior | Testosterone;13;0;;;;undefined;

The interaction with systemic administration of several agonists and antagonists of the GABA-A receptor was assessed. Results showed that intralateral septal doses of allopregnanolone (1.0 μg, P<.05; 2.0 μg, P<.05) or systemic injections of allopregnanolone (1.0 mg/kg sc, P<.05; 2.0 mg/kg sc, P<.05), diazepam (2.0 mg/kg ip, P<.05), or muscimol (0.3 mg/kg ip, P<.05; 0.6 mg/kg ip, P<.05) reduced conflict-like behavior. Subthreshold doses of intralateral septal infusions of allopregnanolone (0.5 μg/side) synergized with systemic subthreshold doses of GABA-A agonists: allopregnanolone (0.5 mg/kg, P<.05), diazepam (1.5 mg/kg, P<.05), or muscimol (0.1 mg/kg, P<.05). The GABA-A antagonists, flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg ip) and bicuculline (2.0 mg/kg ip) attenuated the synergism between intralateral septal infusions of allopregnanolone and diazepam or muscimol, respectively. Conversely, neither flumazenil (P<.05) nor bicuculline (P<.05) attenuated the synergism of the combination allopregnanolone (intralateral septum nuclei; 0.5 μg/side) plus systemic injections of allopregnanolone. In conclusion, allopregnanolone reduced conflict-like behavior probably acting at the GABA-A receptors found in the lateral septal nuclei. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, the mechanism by which barbital exerts this effect is unknown. Results in this work show that the barbital effect is only evident under low aeration conditions (50-ml microfermentors with 7 ml of medium, 0.08 l/h air flow). Under these conditions, cultures with barbital showed similar CO2 production (in relation to a control without barbital), but higher oxygen uptake indicated that the extra O2 consumed was used in the increased rifamycin biosynthesis. Moreover, using a resting cell system where no antibiotic is produced, it was possible to show that barbital inhibits the respiratory chain, since O2 uptake decreased by 30%. Finally, we present biochemical results that suggest that a cytochrome P450-type monoxygenase, which can use atmospheric oxygen, is induced by barbital in an industrial-type strain of A. mediterranei.;Amycolatopsis mediterranei | Barbital | Rifamycin production;7;0;;;;2115-31461;

The higher the hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of the emulsifier blend and the concentration of P in the emulsion, the lower D3,2 of the fat droplets, whereas a higher concentration of G in the emulsion contributed to larger fat droplets. In general terms, the MCFF cheese exhibited higher values of G′ and G″, but lower tan δ values than the MCLP cheeses over the temperature range studied. P contributed to obtain cheeses with higher G′ and G″ values, showing solid viscoelastic behaviour, whilst S promoted fluid behaviour of the cheese during heating. Polynomial models were obtained, that estimate G′, G″, and tan δ values of the MCLP cheeses in function of the emulsifiers concentrations incorporated to the emulsion used to prepare them. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There are several methods of estimating variance components for unbalanced data, which in general produce different results. They can be grouped into four categories: those which are based on the Analysis of Variance Table, Maximum Likelihood, Minimum Norm and Bayesian. A brief description is given of the mixed model, as well as some methods of estimation and the procedures used in the variance estimation of sire and dam within sire for 1308 records of a herd. Elements are provided to facilitate the selection of the appropriate method and procedure. It is concluded that the methods best suited for the type of problems presented in this study are Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian, depending on the initial information available.;Estimation | Variance components;1;0;;;;undefined;

This compound does not bind to the estrogen receptor (ER), but it shows estrogen-like effects under in vivo and in vitro conditions. The estrogenicity of LNG may be attributed to its bio-transformation into non-phenolic metabolites. In this study, the ability of A-ring reduced LNG metabolites to activate transcription via an estrogenic mechanism of action, including differences between ERα and ERβ subtypes, were investigated. Transactivation assays were performed in HeLa cells transfected with expression vectors for ERα and ERβ and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene. Cells were also transfected with expression vectors for both progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms (A or B). As expected, the tetrahydro derivatives of LNG (3α,5α- and 3β,5α-LNG) showed significantly lower PR-mediated transcriptional activities through both isoforms when compared with progesterone (P4) and LNG. In contrast, the 3β,5α-tetrahydro derivative resulted in a significant activation of estrogen-dependent gene transcription. This effect was selectively confined to the ERα, since little if any activity could be observed with the ERβ and no antagonistic activities were demonstrated. This study provides structural and molecular clues for the well documented in vitro and in vivo intrinsic estrogenicity of 19-nor-testosterone-derived progestins and ligand requirements for ERα recognition. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Statistical analysis (P<0.01) revealed that the most relevant variable concerning OS production and yield was the lactose concentration. The coefficient of determination (R2) is good for the second-order OS production model (0.92) and fairly good for the second-order nonlinear OS yield model (0.816). An increase of lactose concentration and temperature resulted in a higher OS production.

Castration of male pigs increased prevalence from 23 to 50% (P<0.001) and pregnancy in sows also increased their prevalence from 28 to 59% (P<0.001). Thus, endocrinological conditions characterized by low levels of androgens or high levels of female hormones probably influence the susceptibility of pigs to T. solium cysticercosis as observed in mice infected with Taenia crassiceps. Delaying castration of male pigs and confinement of sows during pregnancy might significantly decrease the prevalence of pig-cysticercosis and help curb transmission without much cost or difficulty. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Lactic acid fermentation was scaled-up from 2 to 30 kg in column reactors using geometric similarity as the scale-up criterion. The pH rapidly decreased to less than 5.0, allowing preservation of wastes for at least 3 months. During ensilation, deproteinisation and demineralisation were observed.

Testosterone has been considered a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but testosterone's mechanism of action and its cellular site of action are still not clear. However, it is likely that non-genomic extracellular effects of the hormone are involved. With the aim of providing further information about this phenomenon, two membrane impermeant, macromolecular complexes of testosterone were synthesized and their cardiovascular effects were evaluated. We covalently bound testosterone (through carbon 3 or C-17 functional groups) to dextran (2 MDa) and evaluated its effects on isolated and perfused rat hearts (Langerdorff model). Our results showed that the macromolecular complexes increased vascular resistance similarly to free testosterone and blocked adenosine-induced vasodilatation. These effects were exerted rapidly and possibly through a non-genomic mechanism. Blockade of C-3 or C-17 functional groups by binding to macromolecular dextran induced no qualitative and/or quantitative changes in testosterone-induced effects. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

We recently showed sex-dependent differences in rat hypothalamic CaM levels, both in newborn and in adult animals. Here, we evaluated the presence of left-right hypothalamic asymmetries in CaM concentration in male and female rats, as well as the changes induced on these parameters by neonatal (1 h after birth) subcutaneous administration of tamoxifen (200 μg/rat) or testosterone (30 μg/rat). CaM was measured by RIA in each half of the hypothalamus (at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h and at 90 days after birth) in both control and treated animals. In untreated young rats (2-24 h after birth), CaM concentration was significantly higher in the right half of the hypothalamus of males, whereas in females, it was higher in the hypothalamic left half. Treatment of females with testosterone or tamoxifen to males, consistently reversed these results. In the hypothalamus of treated animals, we found higher CaM levels in the left half of males, as well as in the right half of females. In control adult females, CaM concentration was also higher in the left half of the hypothalamus, as it was in the right half of adult males. However, this asymmetry was lost after neonatal hormone manipulation. These results reinforce the role of CaM in the development of sex-related hypothalamic functions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

We cultured aortic endothelial cells from young adult male rats and loaded them with Fura 2 in order to evaluate the direct effects of testosterone on endothelial cells and the probable regulation of bradykinin-induced effects on intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) kinetics, effects that are mediated through an increase in intracellular [IP3], which in turn stimulates the rapid release of Ca2+ from ER stores. Our results show that testosterone had no direct effects on [Ca2+]i kinetics, but did block bradykinin-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentration in endothelial cells. This effect was concentration-dependent; the steroid was applied only 30 s before bradykinin application and thus, the effect can be considered nongenomic in origin. Membrane localization of a putative androgen receptor in endothelial cells could be responsible for this effect.

The group includes five moderately large species, ""peces blancos"" (117-300 mm standard length - SL) and two smaller species, ""charales"" (70-142 mm SL). These species are of great economical, cultural and ichthyological interest for local populations, and their management practices are controversial. We investigated the morphometric, meristic and allozyme variations of the seven species (13 populations) and related the variations with life history, habitat and management procedures. Nineteen morphometric variables, eight meristic variables (by multivariate analysis) and 23 allozyme loci of the seven species and populations of Chirostoma were compared. Principal component analysis (PC) of morphometric and meristic data indicate that both sets of data provided information to differentiate among the seven species. The variables that accounted for most of this differentiation were head length (HL), predorsal 1 length (P1L) and length of pelvic fin base (PfbL). PC and Discriminant Analysis (DA) with morphometric data also suggested the differentiation of populations within C. grandocule (83% correctly classified organisms), whereas PC and DA with meristic data differentiated populations of C. humboldtianum (80% correctly classified organisms). The most important morphometric variables for the differentiation were anal fin height (AfH), length of anal fin base (AfbL) and predorsal 2 length (P2L) and the meristic variables D2fR, PdS and AfR. The genetic variability data indicate changes in values of some of the species in relation to previously reported data. The present populations of C. grandocule show a reduction in He (0.002 vs. 0.009). Other species showed an increase; for instance, C. consocium consocium, C. humboldtianum, C. lucius, C. promelas and C. sphyraena averaged He = 0.069 vs. 0.027. θ indicated significant genetic differentiation among the analysed species (0.247, S.D. 0.159) and θs supported the morphological data that suggest intra-specific differentiation (0.360, S.D. 0.154).";Chirostoma | Genetic variability | Inter-specific | México | Meristic | Morphometric;17;0;;;;undefined;

In whey from 55 up to 75°C, β-galactosidase activity decreased slightly. Nevertheless, heating whey at 85°C for 30 min raised the rate of hydrolysis significantly. Electrophoretic patterns and UV spectra proved that the activity change correlated with milk protein denaturation, particularly that of β-lactoglobulin. Heating whey permeate did not increase the enzyme activity as heating whole whey; but heating whey prior to ultrafiltration also resulted in enzyme activation. Measurement of free sulfhydryl (SH) groups in both whey and heated whey permeate showed that the liberation of free SH is highly correlated to the change of the activity. Furthermore, this activation can be reversed by oxidizing the reactive sulfhydryl groups, proving that the observed effect may be related to the release of free SH to the medium, rather than to the denaturation of a thermolabile protein inhibitor.";Lactase | Sulfhydryl groups | Whey protein | β-galactosidase;16;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

No effects were seen on thalidomide-treated rats on the frequency and time of tumor development induced by ethylnitrosourea. In contrast, a reduction in tumoral growth and mitotic-index was obtained in animals treated with thalidomide in transplanted tumors, melanoma and glioblastoma, when compared with controls (P < 0.001 and 0.025, respectively). These results suggest that, although thalidomide is not a cytotoxic drug for neoplastic cells, it might partially inhibit the tumoral growth through any of its pharmacological actions; by blockage of cell-surface adhesion receptors induction of DNA oxidation, or inhibition of angiogenesis.

Based on previous evidence that seed dormancy in maize is controlled by the vp1 gene, we used a PCR-based approach to isolate two Sorghum bicolor genomic and cDNA clones from two genotypes exhibiting different PHS behaviour and sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA). The two 699 amino acid predicted protein sequences differ in two residues at positions 341 (Gly or Cys within the repression domain) and 448 (Pro or Ser) and show over 80, 70 and 60% homology to maize, rice and oat VP1 proteins respectively. Expression analysis of the sorghum vp1 gene in the two lines shows a slightly higher level of vp1 mRNA in the embryos susceptible to PHS than in those resistant to PHS during embryogenesis. However, timing of expression was different between these genotypes during this developmental process. Whereas for the former the main peak of expression was observed at 20 days after pollination (DAP), the peak in the latter was found at later developmental stages when seed maturation was almost complete. Under favourable germination conditions and in the presence of fluridone (an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis), sorghum vp1 mRNA showed to be consistently correlated with sensitivity to ABA but not with ABA content and dormancy.;Dormancy | Germination | Pre-harvest sprouting | Sorghum bicolor | vp1 gene;31;0;;;CONICET;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas

Drying kinetics and activation energy was determined. Weight per hectolitre, wheat hardness, total protein content, dough mixing time and loaf volume were analysed. The results showed that the initial moisture content and drying velocity lowered the activation energy necessary to extract water from the grain. The effect of temperature and moisture content in the grain were the most important factors to control damage during drying. The hard wheat variety was less susceptible to heat damage than the soft variety, probably due to its higher protein content and harder texture. Weight per hectolitre, wheat hardness and drying did not considerably modify total protein content. Conversely, mixing time and loaf volume showed changes directly related to heat treatment severity.

Mycelial growth, as well as extracellular protease production, was also monitored. Sucrose addition in SmF resulted in catabolite repression of exopectinase activity. However, in SSF, an enhancement of enzyme activity was observed. Protease levels were minimal in SSF experiments with sucrose and maximal in SmF without sucrose. Exopectinase yields (IU/g X) were negligible in SmF with sucrose. The high levels of exopectinase with sucrose and high Aw in SSF can be explained by a much higher level of biomass production without catabolite repression and with lower protease contamination.;Enzyme yield | Exopectinase | Polyurethane | Solid-state fermentation;94;0;;;;undefined;

Some studies have suggested a lead-induced enhancement on lipid peroxidation as a possible mechanism for some toxic effects of lead. However, there are no reports about the association between lipid peroxidation enhancement and brain lead content. In this study, we determined the concentration of lead and the formation of lipid fluorescence products in the blood, as well as in the parietal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum of rats exposed prenatally and postnatally to variable concentrations of lead acetate through drinking water. Pregnant Wistar rats were intoxicated throughout gestation with solutions containing either 320 or 160 ppm of lead. The pups were treated after birth in the same way until 45 days of age. Control animals received deionized water for the same period of time. The developing rats were sacrificed at postnatal day 45 and lead level was assessed biochemically in the blood and different brain regions. Results showed that blood lead levels were increased in a dose-dependent manner. In the brain, lead accumulated preferentially in the parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus as compared to the control group, while lipid fluorescence products were significantly increased in the striatum, thalamus, and hippocampus of the treated animals. These data suggest that in the brain of rats exposed to lead acetate, lead produces a neurotoxic effect with a complex correlation with both lead regional content and lipid peroxidation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.;Central nervous system | Lead intoxication | Lipid peroxidation | Neurotoxicity;98;0;;;CONACYT;119033/120845;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Inoculation levels to obtain a stable shrimp waste silage were also determined. Shrimp waste ensilation was an efficient method of preservation, allowing the recovery of chitin and another added-value products such as pigments, proteins and enzymes. From the various lactic acid bacteria tested, Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus sp. (B2) were the best lactic acid producers, although small quantities of acetic acid were detected in samples inoculated with Lactobacillus pentosus. Therefore B2 was chosen for the analysis of glucose consumption as well as for the determination of optimum inoculation levels. The best results were obtained at 10% (w/w wet basis) and 5% (v/w wet basis) respectively. Presence of starters and initial glucose concentration were critical factors in the fermentation of shrimp waste. High initial glucose and starter concentrations reduced the time and increased the amount of lactic acid produced. The fermentation pattern changed during ensilation from hetero to homofermentative. Shrimp waste ensilation prevented the growth of spoilage microorganisms keeping their microbial counts steady and pH values within the acid region. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.;Chitin | Lactic acid fermentation | Protein | Response surfaces | Shrimp wastes;112;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;British Council

In other cell types, ionic gradients are mainly regulated by the presence in plasma membranes of three metabolically different types of ATPases. The modifications induced during in vitro capacitation of rabbit spermatozoa by the specific inhibition of V-type H+ -ATPases with bafilomycin A were studied. We used chlortetracycline binding to rabbit spermatozoa to monitor capacitation, and the coomassie brilliant blue method to identify acrosome-reacted sperm cells. There was a significant difference between the percentage of epididymal (66 ± 7%) and ejaculated (43 ± 11%) spermatozoa capacitated in vitro, after a 6-h incubation period in the presence of Ca2+ without ATPase inhibitor. The presence of bafilomycin significantly reduced these numbers (25 ± 11 and 16 ± 8%, epididymal and ejaculated spermatozoa, respectively) and eliminated the difference. Ejaculated spermatozoa capacitated in the absence of bafilomycin showed a linear increase in the percentage of acrosome reactions induced by the addition of A23187 (12±5, 23±6 and 31±5 after 15, 30 and 45 min). The presence of 0.2 μmol-1 bafilomycin during the capacitation incubation induced a significant decrease in the acrosome reaction percentages (4±2, 8±3 and 14±4 after 15, 30 and 45 min). The addition of bafilomycin after the capacitating period had no effect upon the induction of the acrosome reaction by A23187. These results indicate that vacuolar ATPases play an important role during rabbit sperm capacitation. However, once the spermatozoa have been capacitated, V-type ATPases do not have a significant participation during the acrosome reaction.;Acrosome reaction | Bafilomycin | Capacitation | Rabbit spermatozoa | V-type H -ATPase +;5;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Diurnal variations of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum, frontal cortex, and amygdala of the rat, were characterized by the stereospecific binding of [3H]-spiperone. Clear rhythms were found in all these areas, but asynchronous to each other. Striatal receptors had diurnal variations with a single peak at 00:00 hours. Frontal cortex receptors showed two peaks at 00:00 and 12:00 hours. Amygdaline complex receptors had two peaks at 18:00 and 06:00 hours. Saturation binding curves and their Scatchard analysis indicated that the diurnal variations in [3H]-spiperone binding are related to changes in receptor density rather than its affinity.

The theoretical total pigment concentration of the microcapsules was 4.6 g/kg. Spectrophotometric measurements indicated that the microencapsulated pigments underwent zero order degradation kinetics, and that mesquite gum provided the pigments a better protection than gum arabic. Mesquite gum microcapsules complied with the requisite of exhibiting a pigment degradation of less than 10% during 6 months, while the gum arabic microcapsules did not. Likewise the chromatic parameters a, b and L experienced zero order kinetics decrease, which was more pronounced for the gum arabic microcapsules. The superior protection provided by mesquite gum is attributed to the thicker adsorbed polymer layers of the microcapsules due to its higher molecular mass as compared to that of gum arabic. Trouts fed diets containing the microcapsules for three weeks acquired muscle pigmentation simi lar to the color exhibited by the natural colorant blend in the microcapsule, establishing the feasibility of employing these microcapsules in fish pigmentation. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The addition of a chiral shift reagent revealed that the most important conformation of the studied β-lactams in solution is that in which the methine proton, of the exocyclic stereogenic carbon, points towards the carbonyl oxygen atom. Since the configuration of the stereogenic exocyclic carbon is known, the orientation of the aromatic ring allows the correlation of the chemical shifts with the absolute configuration of the new stereogenic centers. This method is particularly useful to establish the stereochemistry of oily β-lactams having the N-(1-arylethyl) group. The X-ray crystallographic analysis carried out with (1R,5S)-7-[(1S)-1-(1- naphthyl) ethyl]-2-oxa-7-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one, is consistent with the proposed model for β-lactams in solution.;Absolute configuration | Chiral β-lactams | Cyclic amides | Proton NMR | Ring current effect;1;0;;;;undefined;

The media manipulated the lack of available information about its medical properties and gave erroneous information to the society propagating a lot of myths. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to determine its taxonomic identity and to study the distribution, bark and wood anatomy of this species, and to determine its actual and historic uses, and the compilation of the information about bark pharmacology and toxicity. Its taxonomic identity is established as Mimosa tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir. (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae). It blooms and fructifies from November to June, occurring in Mexico (the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas), Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil, at altitudes of 0-1110 (-1520) m. In Mexico, it is found in dry forests, thorny thickets, Pinus and Pinus-Quercus forests, and in M. tenuiflora pure thickets, along roads and in resting or abandoned culture lands. This species has an aggregate distribution in the forests and a uniform one in the thickets. It presents a mean density of 9 individuals per m2, with 0.45 of frequency per quadrat and 1.69 m2 of mean coverture, and it has a wide range of tolerance to climatic and edaphic factors, confirming their invasive character. Regionally, the wood is used as fuel and fence construction, and against skin wounds and burns (bark tea, powder and/or ointment), and diverse products, such as shampoos, creams, capsules, soaps, etc., are commercialized. The bark is wrinkled, reddish-brown to grey, fibrous texture, 0.5-1.5 mm thick, resinous and with an astringent odor and flavor, and with a great quantity of tannins. The wood presents extremely short vessel elements, with alternate areolate punctuations, and simple perforated plates, vasicentric axial parenchima, confluent stripes, uniseriated rays, extremely short, fine and very short libriform fibres. The bark contains tannins, saponins, an alkaloide fraction, lipids, phytosterols, glucosides, xylose, rhamnose, arabinose, lupeol, methoxychalcones, and kukulkanins.";Anatomy | Description | Distribution | Mimosa tenuiflora | Pharmacology | Tepescohuite | Uses;34;0;;;;undefined;

We have discovered that similar interactions occur in N,N-dimethylformamide dimers. High level ab initio calculations (MP2/aug-cc-pTZV) yield electronic association energies (D(e)) and association enthalpies (ΔH298)) for four dimer geometries. These data provide a lower limit of D(e) = -2.1 kcal mol-1 for the C(α)-H···O=C hydrogen bond. A linear correlation between C- H···O bond energies and gas-phase proton affinities is reported. The gas- phase anion proton affinity of a peptide C(α)-H hydrogen was calculated (355 kcal mol-1) and used to estimate values of D(e) = -4.0 ± 0.5 kcal mol-1 and ΔH298 = 3.0 ± 0.5 kcal mol-1 for the C(α)-H···O=C hydrogen bond. The magnitude of this interaction, roughly one-half the strength of the N-H···O=C hydrogen bond, suggests that C(α)-H···O=C hydrogen bonding interactions represent a hitherto unrecognized, significant contribution in the determination of protein conformation.;;396;0;;;;undefined;

The globin protein from myoglobin is heat stable, shows different molecular weights for each species and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) can partially differentiate some species. To improve the analysis, the heat stable globin protein was extracted and subjected to fragmentation by ESI-CID-MS/MS. The [M+16H]16+ and [M+17H]17+ ions were chosen as precursor ions and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (CID). Fragmentation occurred at proline residues with cleavage either side of the peptide bond leading to the typical pattern of peptide ions. The patterns were dominated by a series of y''(n) fragments of which the fragments from cleavage of the His/Pro residues at 119/120 (y''34 and y''35) were relatively intense. A strategy for differentiating the four species by ESI-MS and ESI-CID-MS/MS is discussed. Copyright (C) 2000.;ESI-CID-MS/MS | Myoglobin;21;0;;;;undefined;

The experimental dissolution data followed a first-order kinetics model, whilst the experimental floatability data followed a first-order decay kinetics model.

We used male rat aorta ECs in culture loaded with fura-2 and a fluorescence imaging system to evaluate the short-term effects of E2 on [Ca2+](i) kinetics. We explored the participation of the intracellular steroid receptor on the effects induced by E2, using tamoxifen (1 μM) and ICI 182,780 (10 μM). Our results showed that E2 (like bradykinin) induced an increase in [Ca2+](i). Such agonist-like effects showed a biphasic curve behavior. The 17β-estradiol effects were not modified by the presence of the intracellular estradiol-receptor antagonist tamoxifen, but it is blocked in the presence of the ICI 182,780. The 17β-estradiol effects were obtained even with restriction of steroid-free diffusion into cells (17β-estradiol-bovine serum albumin). Phospholipase C(β) activity is involved in these effects, because U-73122, a PLC(β) inhibitor, blocked E2 effects. All E2 effects were of rapid onset (milliseconds), exerted at the membrane level, and of rapid offset. We conclude that estradiol can influence the endothelium physiologic responses through effects of nongenomic origin.;Endothelium | Estradiol | ICI 182,780 | Intracellular calcium | Phospholipase C;42;0;;;;undefined;

The principal source of this polysaccharide is India (70% of the world's production). México places fifth worldwide in vegation diversity. The vegetable fiber used in México is imported and there is no important source of production at the industrial level. The family Convolvulaceae has been reported to be a potential source. The present study has determined the amount and time of galactomannan deposited during seed development of Ipomoea purpurea. The compound is principally made up of mannose with branches of galactose, although there are indications of traces of glucose. The results show that the endosperm is the only structure that possesses this polysaccharide. The amount of galactomannan increases during cell wall formation up to the time when the mature hydrated seed stage is reached and the greatest amount is attained.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

The simultaneous arrival of pollen grains to the same stigma generally as results in self-pollination. The pollen grain adheres to the stigma due to the interaction of the sculptured exine of the pollen grain and the papillae of the stigma. At this time hydration and germination begin. The pollen tube (TP) grows through the transmitting tissue, whose cells contain high concentration of a callóse type polysaccharide. A pollen tube arrives and is transferred to the ovule, penetrating it through the micropyle in order to reach the embryonic sac where one synergid immediately degenerates to permit the entrance of the TP thus allowing it to discharge the two male gametes between the central and the egg cell. After pollination the cell walls in the upper third of the style thicken thus forming a plate which impedes penetration by other pollen tubes and also initiating abscission of the upper part of the pistil.;;1;0;;;;undefined;

Arsenic, a human carcinogen, is reduced and methylated mainly in liver cells generating a number of intermediate reactive forms which could lead to the formation of DNA-protein crosslinks. The induction of DPC by arsenite [As(III)] was investigated in the WRL-68 human hepatic cell line, testing the possibility that cytokeratins or cytokeratin-like proteins, due to their high content of SH groups, could participate in DPC. The formation and decay of DPC was dose-related. Arsenite was the only intracellular species present since no methylated As forms could be detected. Thus, DPC can be attributed to the presence of arsenite, an important species present in liver during As exposure, whose permanence in the tissue would depend on the methylation rate of the organism. Several cytokeratins were identified by immunoblotting among the proteins crosslinked with DNA, including cytokeratin 18 (CK18), a specific liver intermediate filament. An augmented presence of CK18 was detected in treated cultures by immunoblotting of total protein PAGE. In liver cells cytokeratin synthesis is tightly correlated with differentiation programs, thus arsenite could not only be damaging DNA but also modifying differentiation patterns in this tissue.;;67;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The observation that contraceptive synthetic progestins exert hormone-like effects other than their progestational activities, prompted us to investigate whether gestodene (GSD) administration may induce oestrogenic effects, even though the GSD molecule does not interact with intracellular oestrogen receptors (ER). To assess whether GSD may exert oestrogenic effects through some of its neutral metabolites, a series of experimental studies were undertaken using GSD and three of its A-ring reduced metabolites. Receptor binding studies by displacement analysis confirmed that indeed GSD does not bind to the ER, whereas its 3β,5α-tetrahydro reduced derivative (3βGSD) interacts with a relative high affinity with the ER. The 3α,5α GSD isomer (3αGSD) also binds to the ER, though to a lesser extent. The ability of the A-ring reduced GSD derivatives to induce oestrogenic actions was evaluated by the use of two different molecular bioassays: (a) transactivation of a yeast system cotransfected with the human ERα (hERα) gene and oestrogen responsive elements fused to the α-galactosidase reporter vector and (b) transactivation of the hERα-mediated transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene in a HeLa cells expression system. The oestrogenic potency of 3βGSD was also assessed by its capability to induce oestrogen-dependent progestin receptors (PR) in the anterior pituitary of castrated female rats. The results demonstrated that 3βGSD and 3αGSD were able to activate, in a dose-dependent manner, the hERαmediated transcription of both the β-galactosidase and the CAT reporter genes in the yeast and HeLa cells expression systems respectively. In both assays the 3β derivative of GSD exhibited a significantly greater oestrogenic effect than its 3α isomer, while unchanged GSD and 5αGSD were completely ineffective. Neither 3βGSD nor 3αGSD exhibited oestrogen synergistic actions. Interestingly, the pure steroidal anti-oestrogen ICI-182,780 diminished the transactivation induced by 3βGSD and 3αGSD in the yeast expression system. Furthermore, administration of 3βGSD resulted in a significant increase of oestrogendependent PR in the anterior pituitaries of castrated rats in comparison with vehicle-treated animals. The characteristics of the 3βGSD- induced PR were identical to those induced by oestradiol benzoate. The overall results demonstrate that 3βGSD and its 3α isomeric alcohol specifically bind to the ER and possess a weak intrinsic oestrogenic activity, whereas unmodified GSD does not. The data contribute to a better understanding of the GSD mechanism of action and allow the hypothesis to be advanced that the slight oestrogenlike effects attributable to GSD are mediated by its non-phenolic, tetrahydro reduced metabolites.;;23;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

On the other hand, male hamsters display a peculiar copulatory pattern known as Long Intromission (LI) after being exposed to repeated mating. In this study, the characteristics of the temporal recovery of sexual behaviour after a sexual satiety test and the possible relationship between the presence of LI and the inhibition of sexual behaviour were analysed. Fifty males were exposed to repeated mating until they reached a criterion for sexual satiety. Thereafter, they were divided in several groups and retested for sexual activity after a period of 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. During the sexual satiety test LI appeared after nine ejaculatory series, with a mean latency of 18 min. Twenty-four hours after the satiety test, all the subjects (Ss) displayed copulatory activity, and LI appeared after a mean of 2.5 ejaculations with a mean latency of 9.1 min, whereas at 48 h, only 20% of Ss displayed sexual activity. During the 72-h period, the results obtained show a clear trend towards normalisation, and finally, at 96 h, all the sexual parameters were fully restored. The data showed that there was a close relationship between sexual inhibition and the presence of LI, and demonstrated that full recovery of sexual behaviour was reached 96 h after the sexual satiety test.

Respiration studies were performed to understand how BC controls the secondary metabolism in this culture system. CO2 production of solid cultures with different compositions was monitored. In cultures of series A, the initial moisture content was increased and this variation was compensated by decreasing the nutrient and BC of the medium. In series B the initial moisture content was increased while BC was decreased and the nutrient content increased. In addition, penicillin production and respiration was also studied in extreme media (dry and concentrated and humid and diluted), with high and low BC. Criteria for the interpretation of respiration kinetics of the idiophase were established for the first time in this work. For the cumulative form (total CO2/g dry matter vs t) as well as for derivative (CO2/g dm/h vs t) respiration kinetics, the CO2 production rate (QCO(2)) was determined by calculating the slope of the cumulative curve. Results indicate that QCO(2) of the tropho- and idiophases was directly related to the BC of the solid medium (and inversely related to penicillin yields). These conclusions were confirmed by analysis of the derivative form, the results of which indicate that a lower but stable metabolic activity is essential for obtaining high penicillin yields in solid-state fermentation (SSF). The results indicate that the derivative CO2 production kinetics proved to be a more precise and sensitive indicator of the culture metabolic activity during idiophase than the cumulative respiration kinetics.;Bagasse | Penicillin production | Respiration | Solid-state fermentation;15;0;;;;undefined;

The serotonin,, receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, 1 mg/kg, inhibited male rabbit sexual behavior when animals were tested 15 min after subcutaneous (SC) administration of this compound. Lower doses, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, were ineffective at a test 30 min after drug injection. Furthermore, 8-OH-DPAT, 0.25 mg/kg, failed to revert the inhibitory effects upon sexual behavior produced by lidocaine application to the rabbit penis. Stimulation of 5-HT(1B/2C) receptors by TFMPP, at doses between 0.625 and 2.5 mg/kg, produced a drastic inhibition of sexual behavior when the drug was administered SC 30 min before behavioral observation. Doses below 5 mg/kg were ineffective when given intraperitoneally 15 min before test. When the 5-HT(1D/2C) receptors were stimulated by the agonist mCPP a reduced number of mounts and ejaculations was observed after the SC administration of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg. Similarly, the mixed 5-HT agonist/antagonist lisuride reduced the percentage of rabbits displaying mounting behavior at doses of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg SC. All compounds tested produced a clear inhibition of male rabbit sexual behavior independently of the receptor subtype activated. These results are at variance with previous observations in rats where 8-OH-DPAT and lisuride produced a drastic facilitation of masculine coital behavior. Moreover, while the inhibition of male sexual behavior in rats produced by TFMPP and mCPP is associated with a disruption of the execution of this behavior, in rabbits these compounds reduced sexual motivation. These results indicate that the effects of serotonergic drugs on sexual behavior are species specific.;Penile anesthesia | Rabbit | Serotonin | Sexual behavior;14;0;;;;undefined;

The results showed that ethanol and acetate were consumed in a mixotrophic way by the nitrifying sludge. At a concentration of 500 mg/L, the nitrification rate of inhibition was different for each compound in which propionate and butyrate were the most inhibitory. At 2000 mg/L the inhibition was 80% with ethanol and 100% with acetate, propionate, and butyrate. With similar concentrations of MVFA, the inhibition was also similar to that in acetate. The effect of the addition of pulses of MVFA at a ratio of 4:1:1 during 14 h on the performance of the continuous nitrifying process with a hydraulic retention time of 3 d was also studied. No inhibition of the nitrification process was observed with pulses of 750-3000 mg of MVFA/L in the input of the reactor. The results in batch cultures suggest that the different degrees of inhibition of the nitrification process were related to the type of organic matter added. The noninhibitory effect of the organic matter in the continuous cultures on the nitrification efficiency of the nitrifying sludge might be related to the feeding pattern.;Acetate | Butyrate | Ethanol | Inhibition rate | Nitrification | Propionate;21;0;;;EC;FMR–CT97-0114;European Commission

The study encompassed rabbit producers, weekly markets where the animals are traded as well as the tourist corridors where rabbit meat is sold in a range of meals. The mean number of rabbits found in the households was 9, though a range between 1 to 49 was encountered. The breeds preferred by the producers were: New Zealand (28%), California (21%), Giant (19%) and Criollo (19%), whilst Chinchilla and Rex, which are breeds valued for their pelt, were reared in 8% of the households. The feeding system included a wide range of products: fresh Lucerne, commercial feed, tortilla, maize, wheat bran, native grasses, household wastes among others. Household consumption was the most common reported objective of rabbit production, though 68% reported selling the animals, thus contributing to family income. The system is discussed in terms of the important role played by rabbit meat as a dish within the tourist corridor, which has stimulated production, as well as the characteristics of production and sale particular to urban agriculture, and contribution to sustainability.;Households | Rabbits | Tourism | Urban agriculture;2;0;;;;undefined;

Growth temperature had no effect on the synthesis of this enzyme, but had an indirect effect due to changes in oxygen solubility. Growth rate was influenced by temperature; maintaining the dissolved oxygen constant at 3.3 mg of DO/l, the optimum growth temperature was 40°C.

Only one of these two arginine auxotrophs (strain Aw99ARG) was transformed with a plasmid containing the A. nidulands argB gene, indicating that this strain was affected in this particular gene. A diploid (D4) was generated via parasexual recombination between these two Arg- strains and was characterized with regard to 2DG sensitivity and pectinase production. This diploid showed wild type sensitivity to 2DG, suggesting that recessive mutations at two different loci were involved in 2DG resistance in each parent strain. The diploid had also increased pectinase production in SmF (127% higher) when compared to the wild type strain, from which all pectinase overproducing mutants were previously isolated, and 10% over Aw99-iii2 strain, formerly characterized as an overproducing strain in SmF.

In the liver, cytokine and growth factor secretion are usually associated with nonparenchymal cells, particularly Kupffer cells. In the present studies, the effect of 24 and 72 h administration of ethanol (50 mM), acetaldehyde (175 μM), and LPS (1 μg/ml) were studied on the expression and secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and TGF-β1, lipid peroxidation damage and glutathion content in HepG2 cell cultures. A 24 h exposure to ethanol induced the expression of TNF-α and TGF-β1, and the secretion of IL-1β and TGF-β1. With the same period of treatment, acetaldehyde markedly increased TNF-α expression, and stimulated IL-1β secretion, while LPS exposure induced the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and TGF-β1, and the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TGF-β1. A reduced in TNF-α response and TGF-β1 expression were observed after 72 h exposure to ethanol. A 72 h acetaldehyde exposure decreased markedly TNF-α expression and stimulated a previously absent TGF-β1 response. With the same time of exposure, LPS reduced slightly TGF-β1 expression, and decreased its secretion. IL-1β and IL-6 were not detected under 72 h exposure conditions. Lipid peroxidation damage was increased in all treatments, but higher values were found in 72 h treatments. Glutathion content diminished in all treatments. These findings suggest that HepG2 cells, independent of other cells such as Kupffer or macrophages, participate in a differential cytokine, growth factor and oxidative stress response, which differs according to the toxic agent and the time of exposure.

P. aeruginosa could metabolize methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) in the presence of pentane as the sole carbon and energy source. The carbon balance for this strain, grown on pentane, was established in order to determine the fate of pentane and the growth yield (0.9 g biomass/g pentane). An inhibition model for P. aeruginosa grown on pentane was proposed. Pentane had an inhibitory effect on growth of P. aeruginosa, even at a concentration as low as 85 μg/l. This resulted in the calculation of the following kinetic parameters (μ(max) = 0.19 h-1, K(s) = 2.9 μg/l, K(i) = 3.5 mg/l). Finally a simple model of MTBE degradation was derived in order to predict the quantity of MTBE able to be degraded in batch culture in the presence of pentane. This model depends only on two parameters: the concentrations of pentane and MTBE.;;90;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

There are sex differences in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and great attention has been placed on the study of estrogen cardiovascular effects. However, there are only a few reports on the effects of testosterone on the vasculature. It is commonly accepted that the mechanism of the action of steroid hormones on target tissues is mediated through the binding of hormones to cytoplasmic or nuclear receptors. However, some studies indicate that steroid action can be extremely rapid and therefore unlikely to be through a genomic mechanism. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of intravascularly confined testosterone on an isolated rat heart to demonstrate acute and possibly nongenomic effects of the steroid. Our results show that testosterone blocked the adenosine vasodilator effect and increased vascular resistance, even when its presence was restricted to the coronary vascular lumen. These effects were exerted rapidly and possibly through nongenomic mechanisms.;Hypertension | Steroid hormones | Testosterone;71;0;;;;undefined;

The study of an air-oxidized pyrite shows that the fixed grains electrode (FGE) is more sensitive than the classical Carbon Paste Electrode (CPE) already used by different authors to characterize various oxides and sulfurs. On the other hand, the concommitant Raman and electrochemical analysis of autoclaved pyrite shows that the cleaned mineral FeS2 has no electrochemical reactivity, and points out that the electrochemical response of the oxidized mineral is exclusively due to the chemical compounds present at its surface. Therefore, the electrode acts as an efficient sensor for pyrite superficial oxidized phases, which are fundamental for the biooxidation process and is consequently very well adapted for the control of the oxidation state of pyrite powder during bioleaching by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans.;Electro-chemistry | Oxidation | Pyrite | Superficial oxidized compounds | Thiobacillus ferrooxidans;13;0;;;;undefined;

Initially the toluene sorption isotherm on peat and the effect of different environmental conditions on the toluene consumption rates of this consortium were measured. The fast start-up of the biofilter and the decay in the elimination capacity (EC) were reproduced using microcosm assays with toluene successive additions. Nutrient limitation and a large degree of heterogeneity were also detected. EC values, extrapolated from microcosms, were higher than biofilter EC when it was operating close to 100% efficiency but tended to relate better as the biofilter EC diminished. In studies on the microbial evolution in the biofilter, an increase in the cell count and variation in the ecology of the consortium were noted. Bacterial counts up to 10 x 1011 cfu/g(dry peat) were found in 88 days, which corresponds to about a 104 increase from inoculum. Observations with SEM showed a nonuniform biofilm development on the support and the presence of an extracellular material.

The mean migration length in control cells was 35.37 ± 1.43 μm (8% damaged cells), whereas the mean migration in cells treated with 0.005 μM CdCl2 for 3 h (acute low dose) was 65.87 ± 2.07 μm (88% damaged cells). Treatment with 0.01 μM CdCl2 for the same time (acute high dose) increased the mean migration length to 125.79 ± 2.91 μm(92% damaged cells). However, a 0.005 μM CdCl2 treatment for 7 days (chronic treatment) only increased 65% DNA migration to 58.38 ± 2.59 μm (88% damaged nucleus). Lipoperoxidative damage expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA) production per milligram of protein was 15.7 ± 2.6 for control cells, whereas in Cd-treated cells the values were 20.2 ± 2.4 (acute low dose), 22.9 ± 2.2 (acute high dose), and 22.6 ± 2.1 (chronic treatment). To study the repair of DNA damage, cells were washed with 0.01 μM meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and fresh Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) added. The percentage of damaged cells diminished after 90 min, with DNA migration returning to control values by 120 min. Cd treatment produced DNA single-strand breaks and the damage was greater in acute high dose treated cells, Lipid peroxidation values did not correlate with DNA single-strand breaks.;Cd | DNA damage | WRL-68 cell;27;0;;;;undefined;

From experimental data a global mechanism has been proposed, but the regioselectivity of the products is uncertain. In this work, the OH-propene-O2 reaction has been studied with ab initio molecular orbital techniques. Reactants, transition structures, intermediate species and products are optimized at the UMP2/6-31G** level for the two possible addition paths. In the first step, OH adducts are obtained with the OH radical linked to either the terminal or the central C atoms. Consideration of the second step, the addition of O2, is required to explain the observed experimental data. The selectivity of the total reaction is found to be temperature and pressure dependent, but independent of the preferred site for the OH attack. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.;;0;0;;;;undefined;

Jakobson ’s model of linguistic functions can be understood as operating performatively with greater advantages to pragmatic theory than Searle and Vanderveken’s taxonomy of illocutionary acts. Consequently, these three dimensions can also be found in the aesthetic as in other linguistic functions proposed by Jakobson when examined from a pragmatic viewpoint. By detecting the direction of fit and establishing a distinction between conversion and constitution, we may better understand not only the difference between the aesthetic and other functions but a variety of instances besides the artistic in which the aesthetic is displayed. Therefore, pathos can be clearly differentiated from the aesthetic as a dimension that may weigh, together with logos and ethos, upon the aesthetic function of an illocutionary act. © 1999 John Benjamins Publishing Company.;;4;0;;;;undefined;

It is a demersal, estuarine-dependent species, distributed throughout the Campeche Sound area (12-54 m). It is found in areas influenced by coastal discharges. The size at first maturity of females is 117 mm total length. Reproduction occurs from February to October in depths 18-36 m. The juveniles are found on the shelf (<20 m) and inside the Terminos Lagoon. Recruitment is in two distinct periods, March-June and August-November, when adults and juveniles migrate to the outer shelf. Greatest abundance is observed in depths of 12-36 m. The biology and ecology of H. jaguana was analyzed in the Campeche Sound to better understand the structure and function of the demersal fish communities. It is a very important species in the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem because it transports matter and energy. A model of the biological pattern for this species in the area is proposed.;Campeche Sound | Demersal | Dominance | Fish ecology | Fish reproduction | Gulf of Mexico | Harengula jaguana;6;0;;;;undefined;

The specimen was isolated and studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. The species has a large cell size (340 μm length and 55 μm width) with some characters typical of the genus Amphisolenia Stein: compressed head, short neck, and an elongated, wide midbody. However, it lacks a posterior narrowing and develops two nearly straight and symmetrical posterior processes, each with two spines at the end, which are features of the genus Triposolenia Kofoid. Therefore, we are dealing with a new species, Triposolenia fallax Hernandez-Becerril et Meave, which has unique characteristics. We consider this species to be a link between the two genera of the Family Amphisoleniaceae. The adaptive morphology of the species and possible evolutionary trends of the genera are discussed.;;4;0;;;;undefined;

In this work, presence of microorganisms indicative of contamination were analysed in meat sold in Mexico City's retail outlets. Enterobacteriaceae, psycorothrophs, mould and yeast, and mesophile counts, were evaluated in meat from five animal species (beef, sheep, chicken, rabbit and horse). pH, recorded as spoilage indicator, was not significantly different among days of storage nor animal species, conversely, water holding capacity was significantly higher for horse meat. Mesophiles, psychrothrophs and Enterobacteriaceae counts were above legal limits in beef after 5 days of storage at 4°C. This was not observed in rabbit nor chicken meat. Mould and yeast populations remained constant until day 4. Moulds are seldom a problem, whereas yeasts play an important role in the alteration of flavour characteristics. In general, horse had the highest initial microbial counts.;;21;0;;;;undefined;

Examination of the total change in accessible surface area in those processes revealed a much larger decrease in free energy per unit of area buried in the case of L-C associations. According to our analysis, this larger stabilization of L-C interactions arises from a more favorable enthalpy of burying a unit of polar surface area, and from higher proportions of polar areas. Hydrogen bonds present at 14 L-C interfaces were identified, and their overall characteristics were compared to those reported before for hydrogen bonds in protein structures. Three major factors might explain why polar- polar interactions are stronger in L-C binding than in protein folding: (1) higher surface density of hydrogen bonds; (2) better hydrogen-bonding geometry; (3) larger proportion of hydrogen bonds involving charged groups. Theoretically, the binding entropy can be partitioned into three main contributions: entropy changes due to surface desolvation, entropy losses arising from freezing rotatable bonds, and entropic effects that result from restricting translation and overall rotation motions. These contributions were estimated from structural information and added up to give calculated binding entropies. Good correlation between experimental and calculated values was observed when solvation effects were treated according to a parametrization developed by other authors from protein folding studies. Finally, our structural parametrization gave calculated free energies that deviate from experimental values by 1.1 kcal/mol on the average; this amounts to an uncertainty of one order of magnitude in the binding constant.";Enthalpy | Entropy | Hydrogen bonding | Lectin-carbohydrate association | Protein folding;49;0;repositoryvor;Green;;undefined;

Three species are newly described here; the remaining 12 were previously classified in Diplazium. All the species of Callipteris grow on wet forest floors at 100-2300 m. In the Neotropics the genus occurs from Guatemala to Bolivia, northern Brazil, and the Lesser Antilles. It has two centers of species richness. The first is the Choco region on the western side of the Andes in Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. This region contains eight species, five of which are endemic. The second center is the mountains of Costa Rica and Panama, where six species occur, three of which are endemic. Only one species, an endemic, occurs in the Lesser Antilles in Martinique, St. Vincent, and Grenada. Four species occur only on the eastern side of the Andes, and these apparently represent at least two separate dispersal events from the western side of the Andes.";Callipteris | Diplazium | Ferns | Pteridophyta;19;0;;;;undefined;

Immature oocytes showed cyclin B immunofluorescent staining in the cytoplasm, whereas mature oocytes showed the immunofluorescent label concentrated in the nucleus. Metaphase chromosomes showed an intense immunofluorescence.

The design considers a stage of analysis, in which the solvability of the estimation problem with robust convergence is assessed a priori, and a stage of synthesis, in which the estimator is constructed and its gains are tuned with a systematized procedure. The approach, which stems from a suitable definition of robust nonlinear observability or detectability, provides a methodological framework that identifies the compromise between the performance and the robustness of the estimator and interprets the functioning of the estimator with notions and vocabulary from conventional-type linear filtering and control techniques. The problem for a class of free-radical homopolymerization reactors is studied as an application example showing how the proposed design, together with available nonlinear dynamics modeling and characterization methods, can be applied to polymer reactor engineering in particular and to chemical-process engineering in general.;;46;0;;;;undefined;

In addition, DNA sequences of the mitochondrial D-loop region were examined in exemplars representing each taxon to further assess the phylogenetic relationship of ambiguus to other members of the P. boylii species group. The morphological study revealed a consistent pattern of increasing size from north to south. Most multivariate analyses separated ambiguus and beatae from rowleyi and showed phenetic affinities between ambiguus and levipes. DNA-sequence data revealed a sister-taxon relationship between ambiguus and levipes to the exclusion of rowleyi and beatae. Morphological and DNA-sequence data are in agreement with previous karyotypic and allozymic studies supporting affinities between ambiguus and levipes. Based on concordance of these four data sets, it is apparent that these two taxa represent subunits within levipes, the ranges of which are divided approximately at the Tropic of Cancer in northeastern Mexico. The appropriate taxonomic designation for ambiguus is as a subspecies of levipes.;DNA sequences | Morphometrics | Peromyscus | Phylogeny | Systematics;17;0;;;;undefined;

In both experimental animals and in humans the production and secretion of less acidic, short-lived FSH glycoforms significantly increase during the peri-ovulatory period. To gain further insights on the physiological role of these FSH variants, we analysed the ability of two FSH compounds, recombinant FSH (rFSH) and purified FSH from urinary origin (uFSH), (less acidic and acidic pattern of FSH charge isoform distributors respectively) to induce ovarian tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) enzyme activity in vivo. FSH produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells and highly purified uFSH were injected at 15:00 h on the pro-oestrous day into phenobarbital-blocked rats and the ovaries were analysed for tPA enzyme activity and tPA mRNA concentrations at different times after FSH injection. Induction of tPA enzyme activity by uFSH and rFSH showed distinct dynamics depending on the particular preparation administered. In animals treated with uFSH, maximum tPA enzyme activity was detected at 20:00 h, and maximum tPA mRNA concentrations were detected at 17:00 h. tPA enzyme activity induction by rFSH was at the maximum at 17:00 h, and maximum tPA mRNA concentration was at 16:00 h (P < 0.05 for uFSH versus rFSH). All animals in the uFSH- and rFSH- treated groups and none in phenobarbital-blocked, saline-treated controls ovulated. No significant differences were present in the number of ova shed by rats treated with uFSH or rFSH and spontaneously ovulating rats (10.7 ± 1.7, 10.0 ± 2.6 and 11.3 ± 1.6 respectively). These data indicate that the increased biological activity exhibited by less acidic FSH glycovariants at the target cell level may compensate for the drawback imposed by their relatively short plasma half-life.;FSH variants | Plasminogen activator | Rat | Recombinant FSH | Urinary FSH;27;0;;;;undefined;

The thickness of the roots was scaled to the thickness of the seagrass rhizomes (r = 0.92, p < 0.001). Root and rhizome biomass were high (>100 and >200 g DW m2+, respectively) for the mixed meadows examined; these belowground structures had a projected surface area often exceeding 1 m2 m-2 when roots and rhizomes were considered together, and they formed a dense web of root material comprising several hundred meters per square meter. Belowground biomass showed considerable vertical stratification within the sediments, with a tendency for the larger species to extend deeper into the sediments than smaller ones. This tendency for segregation should reduce the potential interspecific competition for sediment resources, which is likely to be greater in the uppermost layers, where the belowground biomass is more evenly distributed among species. The rate of adventitious root production on vertical shoots varied from species that produced a root on almost every node to species that produced I adventitious root for every 10 nodes. Root production - both on horizontal rhizomes and vertical shoots - was substantial, with the combined root production approaching, or exceeding, 1000 g DW m-2 yr-1. The resulting root turnover was quite high, with most values ranging between 2 and 10 yr-1, indicative of a characteristic turnover time of months for the root compartment. The estimates of root production derived here often exceed those of rhizome production and reach values comparable to leaf production, clearly demonstrating that root production is an important component (up to 50%) of total seagrass production.";Biomass | Production | Rhizomes | Roots | Seagrass;120;1;repositoryam;Green;;undefined;

The microscopic details of the ChTX-channel interaction, however, remain as a challenge for experimental and theoretical approaches. In this work, regional charge-transfer abilities, measured by chemical softness, s(r), are used as companion properties of the electrostatic potential, V(r), in the search for a qualitative structure-function relationship in the ChTX-K+ channel interaction. Both quantities were obtained with an ab initio methodology in massively parallel computers. In the analysis of s(r) and V(r), regions of the size of amino acids were considered because this is the appropriate scale to correlate with site-directed mutagenesis experiments. The correspondence between experimentally identified crucial amino acids sites and regional softnesses indicates that charge transfer to ChTX could be one of the main stabilization effects in the ChTX-channel complex. Also, it provides an explanation for the strong dependence of the dissociation constant of the complex on mutations of crucial amino acids. In addition, it is shown to be feasible to find structure-function relationships by combining local reactivity parameters and experimental data involving site directed mutagenesis.;;19;0;;;;undefined;

There are 22 genera of Bromeliaceae recorded from the country that include 326 species. The genus Ursulaea with 2 species is endemic to Mexico, while Hechtia with 48 of its 50 species has its principal center of diversity in the country. Tillandsia (175 spp), Hechtia (48 spp) and Pitcairnia (46 spp) are the genera with the greatest number of species. We present a comparative analysis of Mexican Bromeliaceae with that of other American regions that have recently published accounts for the Family, particularly the Mesomerican area, Venezuela, Ecuador, and the Guianas. Our results led us to the conclusion that all these floras should be considered as distinct. We observe a progressive decrease of the Simpson index value related with the remoteness of the Mexican area. A general analysis of the species numbers of Mexican bromeliad genera shows a distinct preference of the species for coniferous and oak forests, followed by tropical caducifolious forests. There is also significant representation of the family in other vegetation types such as cloud forests and tropical perennifolious forests Generally Mexican Bromeliaceae species have scarce and sparse populations and in many cases they inhabit cliffs, bluffs and scarps in restricted areas. Concerning the geographic distribution of Mexican genera, 77.27 % are neotropical, 4.54% are South American and the remainder are Mexican and Central American. The generic endemism is very low (4.54 %), even if we extend the country limits to Megamexico sensu Rzedowsi (1991) it reaches only 13.63 %. The family endemism at specific level reaches 63.07 %. There are not available data about a specific analysis of the conservation status of Mexican Bromeliaceae, but we can point out that a great number of taxa are only known from the type collection or at the most from the type locality. This can perhaps be attributed in part to the fact that there is a lack of sufficient collections; however, we suppose that several species are surely endangered.";Bromeliaceae | Floristics | Megamexico | Mesoamerica | Mexico | Neotropic | Phytogeography;7;0;;;;undefined;

Poir. is an important natural resource in Mexico, due to its diverse uses. However, seed germination, dissemination and seedling establishment of this species had not been studied up to date. Fruits and seeds were collected in the State of Chiapas, Mexico (S. L. Camargo et al. 118, UAMIZ). Germination experiments were earned out after four years of seed storage; 1 935 seeds were sown in Petri dishes containing moistened Wathman filter paper. Optimum temperatures were determined in a gradient 5-40°C, with continuous light for mechanically scarified and non scarified seeds. Three photoperiod experiments were made: a) continuous light, b) constant darkness and c) 12 hr light/12 hr darkness. Three germinate pretreatments were applied: a) mechanical scarification, b) sulfuric acid scarification, c) fire scarification and d) control. Three replicates of 15 seeds each were made for each variable and pretreatment Standard deviations (S) were determined, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and media comparison (Scheffé's test) were applied (p<0.05). Analysis of fruit and seed dissemination and seedling establishment was made qualitatively on the basis of field and laboratory observations; radius of dissemination of the fruits from the mother plant was measured; development of laboratory grown seedlings was followed during three months. Seeds germinated at 10-30°C; however, the highest percentages of germination were obtained at 20°C (84.44%) and 25°C (95.55%); seeds are indistinctly photoblastic and percentages of germination, after the three germinate pretreatments, were: control (24.44-35.55%), mechanical scarification (84.44-88.88%), sulfuric acid scarification (73.33-91.11%) and fire scarification (0%). Fruits and seeds are disseminated by the wind in a radius of 5-8 m from the mother plant; rain carries them from slopes to lower plains and human activities contribute to their dissemination. Growth of seedlings is fast; they develop a paripinnate protophyll and ten biparipinnate pronomophylls; the first nomophyll develops during the weeks 12 to 14. It is concluded that optimum temperatures for seed germination of M. tenuiflora are 20°C and 25°C; seeds are indistinctly photoblastic; percentage and rate of germination are highly increased by coat scarification. This species has certain advantages for its establishment in open areas, given by the abundant production of seeds, their small size, the rate of germination and the fast growth, as well as by its seedling characters: the tap root system, the hypocotyl-epicotyl axis woody at the base and, the compound leaves with linear-oblong leaflets having changes in orientation in response to light.

Blood samples were collected weekly to determine Ct and progesterone (P4) during the last third of pregnancy (90-150 days). Using birth and abortion as criteria, two groups were formed: one including animals which delivered on time (PG), n=14, and another with those animals which were aborted (AG), n=7. Ct was determined by a competitive protein-binding assay and P4 was determined by radioimmunoassay. Present results show that the mean values of Ct in PG and AG groups were similar from 90 days of pregnancy to 7 days before delivery or abortion occurred. However, in AG the Ct levels rose to 46.1 ng/ml during the 7-day interval prior to abortion. In contrast, the Ct levels in PG only reached 11.4 ng/ml in the 7-day interval prior to delivery.

The GABA(A) agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroxixazolo-5,4c-pyridin-3-ol (THIP), the GABA(B) agonist R-baclofen and the GABA antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline were used. Injection of THIP, 20 mg/kg, s.c. produced a complete suppression of sexual behaviour and R-baclofen, 2.5 mg/kg, s.c. a significant inhibition. Intraperitoneal injections produced effects at higher doses than did s.c. injections. The inhibition produced by R-baclofen was associated with strong motor effects as shown by the water escape test. It is probable, therefore, that the reduced sexual behaviour observed after treatment with this drug is a consequence of sedative or muscle relaxant effects. By contrast, the dose of THIP that inhibited sexual behaviour had no effect on the water escape test. These results show that the GABA(A) agonist inhibits sexual behaviour in the male rabbit independent of effects on the motor system. The GABA antagonists had marginal or no effects on sexual behaviour. When these data are compared to previous results in the rat, substantial differences are seen. As there are differences between the effects on rat and rabbit sexual behaviour by other types of drugs, it appears that drug action on sexual behaviour cannot be generalized from one species to another.;GABA | Motor performance | Rabbit | Sexual behaviour;9;0;;;;undefined;

The Campeche Sound, in the southern Gulf of Mexico, has more than 300 species in the demersal fish community and 30 are dominants Among these species, Opisthonema oglinum is dominant by its frequency, distribution and abundance. This work determined the pattern of abundance and distribution of O. oglinum, and its reproduction, maturity and recruitment. Fish were collected with a shrimp trawl net during six oceanographic cruises in the Campeche Sound. The cruises correspond with the three characteristic seasons in the area: rainy, ""nortes"", and dry season. A total of 813 individuals with sizes between 56 and 205 mm of total length were collected; they weighted 30 211.5 g. O. oglinum is a typical pelagic-neritic species, and is estuarine dependent. This species occurs in the inner shelf waters of the Campeche Sound, less than 36 m deep and mainly in areas influenced by coastal discharges. It also occurs in the Terminos Lagoon (southern Campeche Sound) and occasionally in the riverine systems that drain into the lagoon. The highest biomass and density are on depths lesser than 20 m, in June and August-October. The high density of juveniles mainly determines the higher biomass. Maturity can start at a total length of 126 mm, but the size of first maturity is 135 mm of total length. Reproduction occurs from May to October with two evident peaks during May and August in depths greater than 18m. The juveniles are found in the shelf and inside of the Terminos Lagoon. Recruitment is from June to October (rainy season). The visceral and gonadic indices showed that the greatest alimentary activity is from June to August and in November. The condition factor is lowest in June, where the recruitment is highest, and highest in November, after spawning.";By-catch | Demersal | Fish ecology | Fish reproduction | Gulf of Mexico | Opisthonema oglinum | Thread herring;7;0;;;;undefined;

Prior to the towing, temperature of surface water, transparency (Secchi), pH and dissolved oxygen were evaluated A total of 31 zooplankton forms, including 14 species of rotifers, three copepods, five cladocerans and one ostracod, as well as protozoans (mainly vorticellids and ciliates), were detected. Rotifers were the dominant organisms, mainly Brachionus havanaensis (27.6 ind 1-1), B. angularis (6.9 ind 1-1), Keratella cochlearis (4.9 ind 1-1), Conochilus unicornis (10.8 ind 1-1) and C. dossuarius (3.1 ind 1-1). Within crustaceans, higher densities were shown by larvae (nauplii and copepodites) of calanoid (16.8 ind 1-1) and cyclopoid (15.6 ind 1-1) copepods, as well as Arctodiaptomus dorsalis (2 ind 1-1), Mesocyclops edax (0.5 ind 1-1), and the cladocerans Bosmina longirostris (1.6 ind 1-1) and Diaphanosoma brachyurum (0.5 ind 1-1). Densities were low, probably because of a high predation pressure imposed by fishes. A gradual increase in total zooplankton density related with a progressive diminution of transparency was observed throughout the sampling period. Zooplankton densities in the stations located at the central part of the lake were higher when compared with those at a more peripheral position. Time variation in rotifer's relative abundance was directly related to temperature fluctuations. The low density and diversity values, the small size of the zooplankters, the presence of an important number of indicator species, and the calanoid copepods: other planktonic crustaceans low ratio, are all indicators of eutrophy.

Yohimbine, a selective antagonist of the alpha-2 receptors; 8-OH-DPAT, a selective agonist of the 5-HT(1A) receptors; and oxotremorine, a muscarinic agonist, were administered to male rats neonatally treated with clomipramine that showed sexual behavior impairments. Yohimbine and oxotremorine induced only a slight improvement of sexual deficiencies. 8-OH-DPAT not only restored sexual behavior to normal levels, but induced facilitation in most of the copulatory parameters.

It is known that calmodulin antagonists both bind to the hydrophobic domain of Ca2+ activated calmodulin, and inhibit protein kinase C activity. In this work we explored the effects of melatonin on Ca2+ dependent protein kinase C activity in vitro using both a pure commercial rat brain protein kinase C, and a partially purified enzyme from MDCK and N1E-115 cell homogenates. The results showed that melatonin directly activated protein kinase C with a half stimulatory concentration of 1 nM. In addition the hormone augmented by 30% the phorbol ester stimulated protein kinase C activity and increased [3H] PDBu binding to the kinase. In contrast, calmodulin antagonists (500 μM) and protein kinase C inhibitors (100 μM) abolished the enzyme activity. Melatonin analogs tested were ineffective in increasing either protein kinase C activity or [3H] PDBu binding. Moreover, the hormone stimulated protein kinase C autophosphorylation directly and in the presence of phorbol ester and phosphatidylserine. The results show that besides the melatonin binding to calmodulin, the hormone also interacts with protein kinase C only in the presence of Ca2+. They also suggest that the melatonin mechanism of action may involve interactions with other intracellular hydrophobic and Ca2+ dependent proteins.;Autophosphorylation | Calcium | MDCK | Mechanism of action | Melatonin | N1E- 115 | Protein kinase C;55;0;;;CONACYT;1781-N9210;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

The double staining immunofluorescent method showed that calmodulin in control MDCK cells appeared as fluorescent spots at the cell periphery. In contrast, MDCK cells cultured with 10 -9 M melatonin for 6, 12, 24 hr or for 4 days showed that calmodulin fluorescent spots were distributed throughout the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus. These calmodulin rearrangements were reversed 6 hr after melatonin withdrawal. Moreover, calmodulin radioimmunoassay showed that in 10-9 M melatonin- treated cells, membrane-bound calmodulin content was increased by 78% whereas cytosolic calmodulin decreased by 60%. Simultaneous labeling of MDCK cells with specific antibodies against calmodulin and melatonin showed that not only does the indole enter the cell, but that it has the same subcellular distribution as calmodulin. Besides the early responses induced by the melatonin antagonism to calmodulin, the results suggest that the indole may also induce long-term cellular responses by changing calmodulin concentrations in specific cellular compartments.;Calmodulin | Calmodulin antagonist | MDCK cells | Mechanism of action | Melatonin | Translocation;30;0;;;;undefined;

Conversion of pregnenolone (P5) to T and T to E2 were studied in the gonads and brain. The analyses were performed during three periods: the thermosensitive period (TSP), histologically undifferentiated gonads (UDG), and differentiated gonads (DG). In the gonads, serum, and brain, T concentrations were higher at the female-promoting temperature during the three periods, whereas in the gonads and serum, E2 levels were similar at the female and male-promoting temperature. In Di, the concentration of E2 was significantly higher at the female-promoting temperature. Biotransformation of P5 to T in gonadal tissues were slightly higher at the female-promoting temperature in TSP and increased during UDG and DG. Conversion of T to E2, however, was similar at the two temperatures during the three periods. In the brain, the Di showed a higher efficiency for transforming T to E2 at the female-promoting temperature.

Recently, we have shown that male sexual performance in rats is readily affected by different stressors, both acutely and chronically applied. However, there are few reports that directly correlate the increase in corticosteroid levels with the behavioral effects of stress. In this study we investigated whether the administration of corticosterone, either acutely or chronically, could reproduce the effects of stress on male sexual behavior in the male rat. Four doses of corticosterone (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg) or the vehicle, were administered during four consecutive days to sexually experienced males. Male sexual behavior was assessed after the first and the fourth injection. After the last test, males were killed and levels of corticosterone and testosterone were measured by HPLC. We observed an increase in corticosterone plasma levels in a dose-dependent manner. None of the sexual behavior parameters, however, was modified. Plasma levels of testosterone were not modified by corticosterone administration. Both steroids were increased in response to sexual activity, though. These data show that, unlike amphibians and female mammals, corticosteroids do not alter sexual behavior in male rats and suggest that the effect of stress on male sexual behavior cannot be explained by increases in corticosterone.;Corticosterone | Sexual behaviour | Stress | Testosterone;42;0;;;CONACYT;400 200 1789P-M9507;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It has been proposed that lipid peroxidation caused by free radicals may be involved in alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus. Alloxan elicits pancreatic lipid peroxidation which precedes the appearance of hyperglycemia in mice. We studied the effects of silymarin on rat pancreas, the effect of this flavonoid on pancreatic, hepatic and blood glutathione (GSH) together with the pancreatic malondialdehyde concentrations in response to alloxan. On its own, silymarin increases pancreatic and blood GSH without changes in either hepatic GSH or in blood glucose. Silymarin prevents the increase in lipid peroxidation produced by alloxan. It also blunts the sustained increment in plasma glucose induced by alloxan. We suggest that silymarin has a protective effect on the pancreatic damage in experimental diabetes mellitus. This may be related to its antioxidative properties and to the increase in concentrations of plasma and pancreatic glutathione.;Alloxan | Diabetes mellitus | Free radicals | Glucose | Glutathione | Lipoperoxidation | Pancreas | Silymarin;118;0;;;;undefined;

The interval from the beginning of the mating season to first heat was 46.9 days for cows with calves, and 17.4 days for cows without calves (P<0.001). The values for the interval between calving and first heat, and calving and conception were 79.7 and 90.9 days in that order. The percentage of cows needing more than two services to achieve pregnancy was less in the treatment with cows that had calves (28.5%) than those without (43.1%). The response in reproduction behaviour obtained from the animals with calves is discussed in relation to the molasses/urea supplement.";Cows | Molasses/urea | Reproductive performance | Zebu;2;0;;;;undefined;

Spectroscopic data allowed detection of a stable intermediate emerging from structural modifications restricted to local regions of the native molecule. It is suggested that this kind of intermediate could be a common property of lipocalins. Using the same set of parameters that has successfully related thermodynamics and structural properties of other proteins, it is shown that the thermally denatured state of β-lg retains a significant amount of buried hydrophobic surface area. Thus, despite being a small protein composed of a single structural domain, β-lg exhibits a complex unfolding mechanism, comprising at least two other species different from the native and completely unfolded states.;Lipocalins | Partially unfolded states | Thermal denaturation | β-lactoglobulin;19;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

Mesquite gum was the best emulsifying and stabilizing agent, followed by gum arabic and acacia gum. In all cases, pH had a dramatic effect on the emulsion stability against droplet coalescence and color degradation. The stabilizing mechanisms governing these two deteriorative processes were opposite. While coalescence kinetics was hindered at high pH values, color degradation kinetics took place at a higher rate, while the opposite effect occurred at lower pH values. A number of factors were important in determining the emulsifying capacity, the droplet coalescence stability and the color degradation stability of the gums among them, the protein content, the molecular weight, the surface charge and the steric configuration adopted at different pH values.;;35;0;;;;undefined;

This is a first step before evaluating the ability of individual isolated proteins to competitively inhibit sperm-oocyte interaction as part of the process of studying the molecular events of fertilisation. Porcine oocytes were aspirated from ovaries, matured for 48 h in Medium 199, and the zona pellucida (ZP) was removed by exposure to acid Tyrode's solution. ZP-free matured oocytes were exposed to 200-800 μg/ml sperm PM protein for 1 h prior to insemination and during gamete co-incubation. Twenty-four hours after insemination with 5 × 105 capacitated sperm/ml, the oocytes were fixed, stained and examined. Sperm PM protein clearly inhibited IVF in a concentration-dependent manner (r=-0.87). The inhibition index (I50%), representing the sperm PM protein concentration necessary to inhibit IVF to 50% of the control value, was 310 μg/ml. These results demonstrate that solubilised sperm PM protein inhibits the interaction of intact gametes as one might expect for receptor-ligand interactions. Furthermore, the complement of sperm PM proteins appeared maximally effective at a calculated concentration of 690 μm/ml, providing a foundation for further studies with individual proteins.;IVF | IVF inhibition | Pig oocytes | Sperm proteins | Sperm-egg interaction;2;0;;;;undefined;

This species shows a consistent northern orientation of its pseudocephalium (a nonphotosynthetic hairy structure where flowers are produced) and stem tilting in the same direction. Analysis of pseudocephalium orientation was made on field data gathered from subpopulations of C. columna-trajani from slopes with different exposures. Additionally, from morphometric characteristics measured in the field, a model cactus was constructed with the purpose of simulating radiation interception by different morphologies. Variations of this model cactus allowed the simulation of irradiance on erect and tilted cacti, as well as on plants with varying pseudocephalium orientation. Results of irradiance interception by different morphologies were related to actual data of growth rates, flowering period, and rainfall and temperature patterns on the study zone. Sampled individuals of C. columna-trajani showed a significant north-northwest pseudocephalium orientation (angular mean = 339°± 22°). Simulations showed that tilted cacti with pseudocephalia facing northwards increase yearly interception of direct solar radiation by the whole plant compared to erect cacti with or without a pseudocephalium (2 and 7% increase, respectively), and with tilted cacti with the pseudocephalium facing away from the north (9-10% increase). Additionally, the observed morphology decreases radiation interception during the hottest and driest period of the year. From our results, pseudocephalium orientation and stem tilting in C. columna-trajani appear to be morphological adaptations that allow the fine-tuning of a columnar morphology to its thermal and radiation environment. However, the cost of tilting in this giant columnar cactus is that branching (which increases photosynthetic area and reproductive output) appears to be almost impossible without serious risk of stem breakage.;Adaptation | Functional morphology | Growth rate | Irradiance | Mexico | Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) | Pseudocephalium | Semiarid lands | Thermal regulation | Tilting | Zapotitlan;23;0;;;;undefined;

Considering the changes in polar and apolar accessible surface areas due to complex formation, we found that the experimental binding heat capacities can be reproduced adequately by means of parameters used in protein-unfolding studies. The same conclusion applies to the association of the lectin concanavalin A with methyl-α-mannopyranoside. When reduced by the polar area change, binding enthalpy values show a minimal dispersion around 100°C. These findings resemble the convergence observed in protein-folding events; however, the average of reduced enthalpies for lectin-carbohydrate associations is largely higher than that for the folding of proteins. Analysis of hydrogen bonds present at lectin-carbohydrate interfaces revealed geometries closer to ideal values than those observed in protein structures. Thus, the formation of more energetic hydrogen bonds might well explain the high association enthalpies of lectin-carbohydrate systems. We also have calculated the energy associated with the desolvation of the contact zones in the binding molecules and from it the binding enthalpy in vacuum. This latter resulted 20% larger than the interaction energy derived from the use of potential energy functions.";Binding and dehydration energetics | Hydrogen bonds | Isothermal titration calorimetry | Molecular interactions in vacuum | Protein-saccharide interactions;37;0;;;;undefined;

The results showed that all the producers within the study area cultivated temporal native maize species in family plots located next to the homestead with the objective of meeting the nutritional needs of themselves and their animals. The various labours involved in the preparation of the soil, cultivation and harvesting were carried out, in the case of the majority of the producers (95%), using animal and human traction. The primary source of fertiliser was cattle manure. The maize grains were reported to be used in the preparation of staple foods in the local cuisine. A significant percentage of producers (45%) considered the seeds to have magical 'powers', able to secure a good harvest. The importance of maize in this terraced zone is discussed in terms of its role within the context of regional sustainability.;Local resources | Maize | Sustainability;0;0;;;;undefined;

A strategy to estimate the reactions' heat from measurements of reactor temperature is proposed. This strategy is coupled with a linearizing-like feedback regulatory control. Practical convergence of this control scheme is proved when the uncertainty observer satisfies the high gain assumption. The performance of the uncertainty observer and the closed loop behavior is illustrated by means of numerical simulations.;Nonlinear observer | Practical convergence | Robust regulation | Uncertainty terms;8;0;;;;undefined;

The distribution of space demonstrated that the living quarters of the family occupied 20% of the total surface area, while the space per head of cattle was 9.6m. Aggressive behaviour (ie: fighting, pushing and bumping) prevailed over social behaviour (ie: licking), with average attitude values (times observed in the activity during period of 6 consecutive days) of 114 for aggressive behaviour and 56.0 for social behaviour. During the period of observation (6 days), aggressive behaviour consistently dominated over social behaviour.

Cd accumulation in WRL-68 cells is a time-, temperature- and concentration-dependent process. A rapid initial phase of uptake was followed by a second slower phase. The transport does not require energy and 55% of Cd transport occurs by temperature-insensitive processes, possibly by diffusion. The rest of Cd transport (45%) occurs by temperature-sensitive processes, probably ion channels and carriers, that involve interaction with sulfhydryl groups. The calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil inhibit the uptake of cadmium, with an inhibition of 35% after 30 min incubation with 100 μM verapamil and 10 μM Cd. These data suggest that about one third of the Cd enters WRL-68 cells through the calcium channels. The toxic metals appear to use the transport pathways that exist for biologically essential metals. Our results in human hepatic cells are very similar to those reported in cultured rat hepatocytes. It appears that transport pathways available for Cd uptake are similar and independent of the species of hepatocyte origin. Moreover, the WRL-68 cell line seems to be an excellent in vitro model to study the mechanism of cell damage due to Cd.;Cadmium uptake | Hepatic human cell culture | Metal uptake | WRL-68 cells;78;0;;;;F282M;

In non-atretic follicles, activity in granulosa cells increased with increasing follicle size, whereas activity peaked in 3-6 mm follicles in thecal cells. Atresia was associated with declining activity in thecal cells from follicles in the 3-6 mm range and in granulosa cells from the > 6 mm range.

On the other hand, the stimulation of central muscarinic receptors with oxotremorine (OXO), a specific agonist, facilitates the expression of masculine sexual behavior in rats. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between T and the cholinergic system, recording the effect of OXO administration on masculine sexual behavior in gonadectomized rats, before and after receiving T treatment. Sexually experienced and unexperienced male rats were gonadectomized and periodically tested for sexual behavior. Once this behavior was absent or drastically reduced, males were treated with OXO or saline and sexual behavior was assessed. 112 or 167 days later, animals were treated daily with T during 21 days, recording the response to OXO in days 12 and 21. Sexual behavior decreased more rapidly after gonadectomy in inexperienced males. OXO administration did not improve sexual performance in either group. The administration of T rapidly restored sexual behavior of experienced males; recovery of inexperienced males was slower. In the presence of T, OXO administration exerted a facilitative effect on sexual performance of both groups.

One-dimensional SDS-PAGE showed that a 16 kDa protein was overexpressed in stationary phase as well as 2 h after an acid shock, and that it was not expressed when the bacteria reached the stationary phase in medium with limiting lactose concentrations (5 or 10 g l-1), in which the pH (5.5) was not as acid as in control cultures (pH 4.7, lactose 20 g l-1). The results support the idea that this protein is expressed in response to the acidic environment and not in response to the growth phase. Two-dimensional PAGE showed that nine proteins were expressed only during the exponential phase and ten others only during the stationary phase. The 16 kDa band seen in one-dimensional SDS-PAGE corresponded to a 16 kDa protein family observed on two-dimensional SDS-PAGE/IEF gels, whose expression was increased 8.5-fold when the extracellular pH reached a critical value below 5 0.

Basal α(1b)-adrenoreceptor phosphorylation was markedly increased by endothelin- 1, norepinephrine, and phorbol esters. The effect of endothelin-1 was dose dependent (EC50 ≃ 1 nM), reached its maximum 5 rain after stimulation, and was inhibited by BQ-123, an antagonist selective for ET(A) receptors. Endothelin-1-induced α(1b)-adrenoreceptor phosphorylation was attenuated by staurosporine or genistein and essentially abolished when both inhibitors were used together. The effect of norepinephrine was not modified by either staurosporine or genistein alone, and it was only partially inhibited when both were used together. These data suggest the participation of protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase(s) in endothelin-1-induced receptor phosphorylation. However, phosphoaminoacid analysis revealed the presence of phosphoserine and traces of phosphothreonine, but not of phosphotyrosine, suggesting that the putative tyrosine kinase(s), activated by endothelin, could act in a step previous to receptor phosphorylation. The effect of endothelin-1 on α(1b)-adrenoreceptor phosphorylation was not mediated through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Calcium mobilization induced by norepinephrine was diminished by endothelin-1. Norepinephrine and endothelin- 1 increased [35S]GTPγS binding to control membranes. The effect of norepinephrine was abolished in membranes obtained from cells pretreated with endothelin-1. Interestingly, genistein plus staurosporine inhibited this effect of the endothelial peptide. Endothelin-1 did not induce α(1b)- adrenoreceptor internalization. Our data indicate that activation of ET(A) receptors by endothelin-1 induces α(1b)-adrenoreceptor phosphorylation and alters G protein coupling.;;65;1;publisherhybridgold;Hybrid Gold;;undefined;

Pelvic thrusting in all copulatory behavioral responses appeared as series or trains of rhythmical, synchronic, vigorous movements. The various pelvic thrusting trains lasted around 1 s on average, but those of mounts were significantly longer than the trains displayed in the other behavioral responses. The frequencies of pelvic thrusting were similar in all responses (around 15 thrusts per s) excepting mounts which had lower values. In intromission, ejaculation, and long intromission responses, when penile insertion occurred, pelvic thrusting either was interrupted or showed changes in its characteristics: penile insertion was related to a period without thrusting in intromissions, to a series of intravaginal thrusting of higher frequency (16.4 thrusts per s) and lower vigor in ejaculations, and to a prolonged period of 6 to 25 s of slow intravaginal pelvic thrusting (1-2 thrusts per s) in long intromissions. Penile insertion lasted longer in ejaculations than in intromissions and it was significantly shorter in both of these responses than in long intromissions.

Among the nutritive media tested, sugar cane bagasse complemented with a synthetic medium containing glucose (200 g 1-1) gave a fruity aroma while the leucine or valine-containing medium gave a strong banana aroma. Aroma production was dependent on growth and the maximum aroma intensity was detected at about the time of the maximum respirometric activity. Twenty-four compounds have been separated by GC headspace analysis and 20 were identified, among them: 1 aidehyde, 7 alcohols, 4 ketones and 8 esters. It was dearly demonstrated that the chromatographic profile of the headspace of the culture was dependent on the substrate used and on the eventual precursor added. When leucine or valine was added to the substrate, the production of total volatiles in the headspace reached values up to tenfold higher than that for ripe bananas.

The addition of comonomers and solvent, and the rate of heat exchange must be simultaneously manipulated to maintain safety, operability, and the product quality adequately, yielding a process with nonlinear behavior, strong and asymmetric input - output multivariable coupling, and potential for open-loop instability and state multiplicity, as shown in earlier dynamics and control studies. Accordingly, the key control objectives of the copolymerization reactor are: the compensation of interaction, the preclusion of input multiplicity and the robustness (i.e., tolerance to modeling and tuning errors) of the controller. In principle, these control issues should be considered within a nonlinear setting. Otherwise, the reactor may have to be operated with a conversion that is conservatively below what can be handled by standard mixing and heat-exchange equipment. To assess the inherent control possibilities and limitations of a given copolymerization reactor, a methodology to address the control problem is proposed such that the nonlinearity, interaction, input multiplicity, and robustness issues are explicitly confronted. The result is a linear multivariable interaction compensator whose tuning can be done with notions and tools from conventional control. This method is tested with the copolymerization of vinyl acetate with methyl methacrylate, dissolved in ethyl acetate.;;11;0;;;;undefined;

Present studies were designed to explore the possibility that ring-A reduced progesterone metabolites might play a role in controlling the duration of estrous behavior. To this aim ovariectomized (ovx) Sprague Dawley rats implanted with guide cannulae directed towards the VMH or the MPOA were submitted to a systemic hormonal treatment to provoke P-induced sequential inhibition (estradiol benzoate (EB) at time 0 + P at 44 h + P at 68 h). The second dose of P was administered simultaneously with the ic implantation of one of the following P metabolites: 3β-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one (5β,3αP), 3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one (5β,3αP) or 3β-hydroxy-5βpregnan-20-one (5α,3βP) into the MPOA or VMH. Lordosis behavior was evaluated by the lordosis quotient (LQ = number of lordosis/10 male mount x 100) and by the percentage of responding subjects. Results show that 5β,3βP implanted into the VMH or MPOA counteracted the sequential inhibitory effect induced by systemic administration of P. 5α,3βP was also able to counteract sequential inhibition, but with less potency and only in the VMFI. Results show that P-induced sequential inhibition can be counteracted by intrabrain administration of ring-A reduced progestins in both the VMH and MPOA.

Among the 14 selected species, six were shrubs and eight were trees. All these species were available all year round. The 14 species showed invasive tendencies and different quantities outside the communities than inside the communities. The values of ecological importance (1.9-4.4) were similar or higher to those found (1.96) in oaks (Quercus spp.), which is the dominant tree species in the region. The foliage of the 14 species contained crude protein (CP) levels of 7.2-22.3%, gross energy (GE) between 2.9-4.5 kcal/g; neutral detergent fiber (NDF) of 21-59%; acid detergent fiber (ADF) of 18-51%; tannic acid 0.42-0.69 g/100 g, absence or low content of cyanogenic glucosides and low, moderated or high contents of alkaloids.

The model of the bulk fluid is that proposed by Stell and Zhou, which is a generalization of Wertheim's model for dimerization. The formation of dimers results from the interaction between the intracore attractive sites. The fluid-solid interaction consists of two terms. The non-associative term is that proposed by Steele. The directional associative fluid-solid atom interaction is chosen to have a Gaussian form. This provides bonding of the bulk fluid particles with the solid atoms. The solid substrate is assumed to be the graphite basal plane. The density profiles are studied by using the associative singlet Percus-Yevick approximation. When the distance from the surface is greater than the dimer length, the effect of crystalline symmetry is not apparent. The second adlayer tends to disappear when association is present. The relative importance of various positions in the surface unit cell tends to be less when the size of the fluid atom is larger. The dimers prefer to be oriented parallel to the surface but are tilted from the surface plane when bonded to the carbon atoms. Only a small fraction of non-associatively adsorbed dimers have a near-normal orientation.;;7;0;;;;undefined;

Vegetation-environment relationships were examined with Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA). Ordination axes were interpreted mainly by altitude and soil moisture. Response curves of life-forms along these gradients were explored fitting generalized linear models (GLIM's). We believe that the life-forms approach for the study of vegetation-environment relationships is a valid alternative to the traditional species approach usually used in phytosociological research because: i) life-forms number was found to be an excellent species diversity predictor, ii) this approach enables considerable reduction in the bulk of data without losing ecological information, and iii) life-forms represent ecological strategies perse and, they constitute an index of the number of different ways the desert's resources are utilized.;Desert plants | Morphological attributes | Morphological strategies | Multiple discriminant analysis | Ordination | Response curves | Xerophyllous scrub;11;0;;;;undefined;

Dairy production is an activity which is carried out in the back-yard of the household. The number of animals in each household varied between 3 and 250 with the highest percentage of producers (63%) owning small herds of between 3 and 19 animals. The main breed was commercial Holstein. The feeding system was complex with a wide use of by-products and rejected vegetables from the markets. Milk production varied widely between 6 and 22 litres per cow per day. There was strong evidence that the milk was being mixed with water in a ratio of 4:1. Surplus milk was processed to make cheese, cream, jelly and custard or given to calves in large quantities to be transformed into liveweight. Dairy production under suburban conditions in the east of the metropolis is a good example of adaptating the production system to the conditions of the city. The system has evolved in a way that has made it sustainable from the economical, social and environmental points of view. It could be used as a model with potential to be replicated in other similar environments.;Farming system | Milk production | Peri-urban | Sustainability;10;0;;;;undefined;

Lower doses were ineffective. Castrated males were treated with both drugs at two intervals after castration, 19-21 and 27-29 days postcastration, respectively. Amphetamine was without effect while flupenthixol, 1 mg/kg, reduced sexual behavior at the test 19-21 days postcastration. At the second test, sexual behavior was almost completely absent in control animals. Therefore, no further reduction could be observed after treatment with flupenthixol. Another group of animals was castrated and given androgen replacement. Testosterone decanoate was injected once weekly at a dose of 3 mg/kg. This treatment maintained a stable, low sexual activity. In these animals, amphetamine was again ineffective whereas flupenthixol, 1 mg/kg, inhibited sexual behavior. Gross motor function was evaluated in a water escape test. Amphetamine was inactive, and the effective dose of flupenthixol was 10 mg/kg. This dose is far above the dose required for inhibiting sexual behavior.

Calcium uptake in cells occurs through specific membrane channels. Since cadmium inhibits calcium uptake, this study was carried on to elucidate the mechanism of Cd interference with calcium transport using the fetal hepatic cell line WRL-68 as an in vitro model. Ca accumulation by WRL-68 cells presented an initial rapid phase, followed by a sustained phase of slower accumulation over a 60 min period. A concentration of 50 μM CdCl2 produced 39% inhibition of the uptake of CaCl2 (100 μM), while 100 μM nifedipine or verapamil decreased Ca accumulation by 35 and 63%, respectively. All Cd concentrations tested produced significant decrease in Ca uptake in a concentration-dependent manner at 1 min and thereafter, although with 10 μM CdCl2, no significant difference was found after 30 min of incubation. From the Lineweaver-Burk plot, we found that Cd exerted a competitive inhibition on Ca uptake, since there was no significant effect on the V(max) but an increased K(m). A second order rate constant of Cd inactivation of 0.061 mM-1·s-1 was determined from the course of Ca uptake during Cd inhibition. SH groups seemed to play an essential role in Ca inhibition uptake by Cd because the inhibition of Ca accumulation by 50 μM Cd was practically reversed after the addition of dithiothreitol.;Ca inhibition uptake | Cadmium | Human hepatic fetal cell line;23;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

P. oceanica developed the densest meadows (1141 shoots m-2) and the highest aboveground biomass (1400 g DW m-2) between 38 and 39°N. P. oceanica shoots produced, on average, 1 leaf every 47 d, though leaf formation rates in the populations increased from north to south (range 5.7 to 8.9 leaves shoot-1 yr-1), P. oceanica is a long-living seagrass, with shoots able to live for at least 30 yr. P. oceanica recruited shoots at low rates (0.02 to 0.5 ln units yr-1) which did not balance the mortality rates (0.06 to 0.5 ln units yr-1) found in most (57%) of the meadows. If the present disturbance and rate of decline are maintained, shoot density is predicted to decline by 50% over the coming 2 to 24 yr. Because P. oceanica rhizomes grow very slowly (1 to 6 cm yr-1 apex-1), maintenance of existing meadows is essential, and our results suggest bad future prospects for P. oceanica in the Spanish Mediterranean Sea like most other seagrass species in the world oceans.;Leaf growth | Posidonia oceanica | Rhizome growth | Seagrass decline | Shoot demography;212;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

MEL binds to CaM with a high affinity, and has been shown to act as a CaM antagonist. Among the CaM-dependent enzymes, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) is a particularly abundant enzyme in the nervous system. In the brain it phosphorylates a broad spectrum of substrates, thus modulating important neuronal functions. We describe the MEL effect on CaM-kinase II activity in vitro. CaM-kinase II was purified from rat brain by column chromatography, and identified by Western immunoblotting. CaM-kinase II activity was assessed in the presence of Ca2+/CaM by the kinase's ability to phosphorylate the synthetic substrate syntide-2 and by enzyme autophosphorylation. MEL inhibited CaM-kinase II activity, and enzyme autophosphorylation. Inhibition of the enzyme by 10-9 M MEL was nearly of 30%. Trifluoperazine (10 μM), W7 (10 μM), and compound 48/80 (30 μg/ml), inhibited CaM-kinase II activity by 40%, 42%, and 93%, respectively. Both EGTA (5 mM) and MEL (10-5 M) abolished autophosphorylation. The effect of MEL on CaM-kinase II activity was specific, since neither serotonin, N-acetylserotonin, nor 6-hydroxymelatonin inhibited its activity. Our results support the hypothesis that MEL acts as a CaM antagonist and cellular functions may be rhythmically regulated by MEL modulation of CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation.;(Rat brain) | Autophosphorylation | Calcium ion/calmodulin-dependent kinase II | Calmodulin | Calmodulin antagonist | Mechanism of action | Melatonin;126;0;;;CONACYT;1781-N9210;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

It is argued that this equation of state is reliable for a large diameter ratio. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are performed for many states, some of high density and large diameter ratio. At moderate densities away from the solid-liquid transition, the MC results show reasonably good agreement with the BMCSL's prediction of the compressibility factor. This confirms the earlier findings of Jackson et al. for the validity of BMCSL in the liquid phase. The failure of the BMCSL prediction in some states is due to proximity to the solid-liquid transition and not due to the large diameter ratio. The individual pair distribution functions predicted by the BMCSL in all cases, however, can be poor, especially, for a pair of large spheres at very low concentration. Comparison of the MC distribution functions and those predicted by several theories are made. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;;56;0;;;CONACYT;4186-E9405;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Sperm suspension was incubated at different temperatures (37, 40, 43, and 46°C) in media, keeping constant the concentration of either heparin or GSH and increasing concentrations of the other reagent. Spermatozoa nuclei without any treatment, incubated for 72 h, appear densely condensed. swelling of hamster spermatozoa nuclei was observed after 30 min of incubation in the presence of efficient concentrations of heparin-GSH. The extent of this time lag was significantly reduced at higher temperatures. DNA presence was verified by the use of ethidium bromide, acridine orange, and Feulgen stain. Phase-contrast microscopy shows that nuclear decondensation begins at the equatorial levels, with DNA highly condensed at the acrosome pole, and the basal pole as the DNA attachment point. Electron microscopy observations showed that hamster sperm nuclei initiates its' decompaction at the peripheral regions and this behavior remains until late stages of decondensation; nevertheless, the chromatin is organized into 'hub-like' nuclear bodies that measured 10-100 nm in diameter, joined by a network of chromatin fibers with apparent reduction in number. At the decondensation full stage, the network seems to be wide open with a reduced number of hub-like nuclear bodies present in the interlace. DNA is not organized into topologically constrained loop domains and is attached to the basal plate instead of to the nuclear matrix or any other structure.";Acridine orange | Chromatin | Heparin | Histone | Nuclear matrix | Protamine | Reduced glutathione;12;0;;;;undefined;

A sequential study was performed with electronic microscopy and flow cytometry techniques, where the binding of 4 lectins was assessed on normal human sperm samples during the in vitro induction of the acrosome reaction with calcium ionophore A-23187. Triticum vulgaris agglutinin (WGA) was shown to bind strongly the whole surface of sperm before induction of the acrosome reaction, and in lesser amounts after incubation with calcium ionophore. Arachis hypogea agglutinin (PNA) and mostly Concanavalia ensiformis agglutinin (Con-A) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-I) binding evolved in an opposite pattern with an increase of the labeling parallel to that of GB24 antibody binding. Electron microscopy showed that the fluorescence patterns observed correlated with increased access to the inner membrane of the acrosome. This was significant 60 min after the induction of acrosome reaction.

As a result, sufficient conditions for closed-loop asymptotic nominal stability, as well as a systematic and simple design-tuning procedure, are obtained.

A water-treated sample was used as the control. Bacterial colonization was determined over a 13 d refrigerated (4 °C) storage period. Propionic acid at 0.133 mol/L reduced the pseudomonad count by 3 log10 cfu/g over this period, whereas 0.41 mol/L propionic acid reduced pseudomonad counts by 8 log10cfu/g. Combinations of ascorbic and propionic acid solutions were effective in reducing the microbial load of the minced pork. Headspace volatiles from untreated and treated minced pork were trapped on Tenax and analysed by GC-MS. Greater amounts of lipid oxidation were found in all acid-treated meats (apart from ascorbic) relative to the water-treated control sample. Meat colour was best preserved when ascorbic acid was present. Minced pork treated with solutions of propionic acid showed surface bleaching and an increase in lipid oxidation volatiles when compared with the control.

These stressors were applied during 20 consecutive days and masculine sexual behavior was assessed on days 1, 4, 8, 12, 15 and 20. Motivational component, copulatory performance and copulatory potential were drastically altered by WIM. EFS produced significant alterations in almost all sexual parameters recorded but only when it was applied chronically. IMB only altered mount frequency and hit rate, although inconsistently.

Delile leaves in the Spanish Mediterranean. Two patterns of herbivore consumption along the life-span of P. oceanica leaves were found, namely a linear and a parabolic curve of cumulative leaf consumption versus leaf age, which are indicative of leaf- age-independent consumption rates and preference for mid-aged leaves, respectively. The fish Boops salpa contributed about 75% to the total herbivore consumption, and seemed to be responsible for the parabolic pattern of consumption with leaf age. Herbivory appeared to be a minor factor in the control of P. oceanica production since it only accounted, on the average, for about 2% of its leaf production. This percentage tends to increase in the northern populations of the Spanish Mediterranean as a result of the longer leaf life-span and associated higher cumulative consumption values, and the lower leaf production of these populations. It is concluded that, in spite of the low levels of herbivory on P. oceanica in the Mediterranean, this seagrass supports a high herbivore production due to its large primary production.;Boops salpa | Herbivory | Posidonia oceanica | Spanish Mediterranean;85;1;publisherfree2read;Bronze;;undefined;

The venom selectively and reversibly blocked the Ca2+ ‐dependent K+ current (IK(Ca)) present in crayfish muscle in a dose‐dependent manner without affecting voltage‐gated Ca2+ or K+ currents. Furthermore, the venom also reduced IK(Ca) in chromaffin cells, without modifying voltage‐gated Na+, Ca2+, or K+ currents. Synaptic transmission in crayfish muscle was also affected by the venom. Repetitive excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (each associated with a presynaptic action potential) were evoked by each nerve stimulus, suggesting that presynaptic IK(Ca) may control the electrical activity of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic fibers. We conclude that B. cangicum venom includes a toxin that selectively and reversibly blocks Ca2+ ‐dependent K+ currents in crayfish muscle and in bovine chromaffin cells, and modifies excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, probably abolishing a similar conductance at the presynaptic fibers. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

The species is morphologically similar to C. leprieurii but characterised by the production of bisporangia and, less commonly, tetrasporangia, and the lack of sexually reproducing plants. In eight culture isolates from throughout the geographic range of the species only the bisporangia were viable. The present known distribution of Caloglossa apomeiotica is from Bahia Magdalena, Baja California Sur to Barra de Navidad, Jalisco in Pacific Mexico. It is suggested that C. apomeiotica is derived from C. leprieurii populations further south in the Americas through a loss of sexual reproduction. Based on our field collections in March, 1993 the nearest populations of sexually reproducing C. leprieurii are 1200 km away in Estero las Garzas, Chiapas, Mexico and extend south into Guatemala. © 1994, Walter de Gruyter.

Synaptosomal and mitochondrial fractions were characterized with plasma membrane and mitochondrial enzymatic markers. Synaptoso‐mal Na+‐K+‐ATPase was not affected in vitro by PHT 1–200 μM or by chronic treatment with 2–50 mg/kg/day of the unlabeled drug for 8 days. Mitochondria1 Mg2+‐ATPase was significantly stimulated by PHT after chronic treatment with 5 mg/kg/day for 8 days; reaching maximal effect (76%), at 10–25 mg/kg. PHT had no effect on mitochondrial Mg2+‐ATPase when added in vitro. [14C]‐PHT binding in vitro to the subcellular fractions was determined by dialysis to assess in vivo binding of the unlabeled PHT during chronic treatment. Indeed, [14C]‐PHT bound to synaptosomes was significantly reduced by chronic PHT treatment from 218 ±10 to 119 & 11 pmol/mg protein after 1 week of treatment; a similar effect was obtained after 2–3 weeks with 10 mg/kg/day. Mitochondrial fraction bound 117 ±10 pmol/mg protein labeled PHT. Chronic treatment with unlabeled PHT also reduced the amount of [14C]‐PHT bound to 19.9 ± 2.2 pmol/mg protein. These results show slow reversible PHT in vivo binding to synaptosomes and mitochondrias from rat cerebral cortex, supporting the idea that the modulatory action of PHT on Na+ and Ca2+ permeabilities are mediated through these slow reversible binding proteins. The data also suggest a possible role of intra synaptosomal mitochondria in [Ca2+]i buffering. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Production of endo- (endo-p) and exo-pectinase (exo-p) by SSF was not reduced when glucose, sucrose or galacturonic acid (up to 10%) were added to a culture medium containing pectin. Moreover, both activities increased when concentrations of the carbon sources were also increased. In SmF, these activities were strongly decreased when glucose or sucrose (3%) was added to culture medium containing pectin. The addition of galacturonic acid affected endo-p activity production to a lesser extend than exo-p. Final endo-p and exo-p activities in SSF were three and 11 times higher, respectively, than those obtained in SmF. The overall productivities of SSF were 18.8 and 4.9 times higher for endo-p and exo-p, respectively, than those in SmF. These results indicate that regulatory phenomena, such as induction-repression or activation-inhibition, related to pectinase synthesis by A. niger CH4 are different in the two types of fermentation. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.;;193;0;;;;undefined;

In this study, four different stressors were prenatally applied to rats. Pregnant rats were subjected to immobilization, unavoidable electric foot shocks, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMd), or immersion in cold water. During adulthood, male offspring were tested for masculine and feminine sexual behavior. The results corroborated the fact that immobilization induced an impairment of masculine sexual behavior and a facilitation of feminine sexual behavior. Electric shocks showed only minor differences in masculine behavior when compared to intact controls, and no signs of lordosis behavior were observed. The REMd group displayed a major impairment of masculine behavior, even greater than that observed within the immobilization group. However, lordosis behavior was only induced with estradiol. On the other hand, water immersion seems to have a facilitatory effect on several parameters of masculine behavior and did not show lordosis behavior even with hormonal treatment. These results strongly suggest that changes in sex behavior induced by prenatal stress are linked to the nature of the stressor. © 1993.;Foot shocks | Immobilization | Prenatal stress | REM deprivation | Sexual behavior | Water immersion;49;0;;;;undefined;

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) was the most frequent malignancy (81%) followed by non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (12%). All cases of NHL were of high or intermediate grade and most of them were extranodal. Out of the 34 individuals with KS, 22 (65%) showed oral KS and in 21 of them the palate was involved. The clinical features of oral KS including site, appearance and size are described. Pseudo‐membranous candidosis (PC), hairy leukoplakia (HL) and exfoliative cheilitis (ECh) were also found in these patients. There was no association of these lesions with any type of cancer. A strong association of oral candidosis and history of this infection was found, RR = 7.0 (1.3–4.1). There was evidence of severe immunosuppression in most patients, with mean average CD4 counts of 116 mm3 (range 4–841 /mm3). Oral KS, ECh, PC and HL were more common in patients with lower CD4 counts. Our findings illustrate the most frequent oral lesions associated with HIV‐1 infection in patients with AIDS and cancer, and further support the importance of oral examination in HIV infected patients.

In purified subsets of human cortical and medullary thymocytes dexamethasone caused cell lysis with similar kinetics in both populations; 50% of thymocytes were killed after 20–24 h of incubation with the steroid. The mechanism of dexamethasone‐induced cell death seems to correspond to apoptosis since degradation of DNA into oligonucleosome‐sized fragments could be observed in the cultures treated with the steroid. A certain degree of DNA fragmentation and cell death could also be observed in control cultures of thymocytes. In contrast, peripheral T lymphocytes were resistant to the cytolytic effect of glucocorticoid hormone. The killing of human thymocytes by dexamethasone was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that this cell death program requires a fully operating protein synthesis machinery and perhaps the induction of new proteins.

This generalization permits the construction of multidimensional diagrams using multiconditional constants for the study of chemical equilibria in aqueous solutions of multicomponent systems. The predominance-zone diagrams can be constructed by defining generalized species, complexation coefficients (with a multiplicative structure instead of the traditionally used additive structure) and generalized complexation and dismutation equilibria for multibuffered systems. Systems involving mixed complex formation were studied by using copper(II)-nitrilotriacetic acid-histidine-proton (under buffered conditions in pHist′ and pH) and mercury(II)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-ammonia-proton (under buffered conditions in pNH3′ and pH) as examples. © 1991.;Complexation equilibria | Equilibria | Predominance-zone diagrams;22;0;;;CONACYT;undefined;Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Small amounts of starter culture (1% v/w) were required to produce a high level of lactic acid (> 28 g kg−1 DM) and to reach a pH of at least 4. The Gompertz model was used to evaluate the effect of inoculation level on the lactic formation based on kinetic criteria. Also an empirical pH lactic acid correlation was proposed to monitor the progress of ensiling, based solely on pH measurements. The simulation model may be used to improve guidelines for silo safety and to evaluate the effect of lactobacilli inoculants.

The acidification kinetics were followed during the first 2 days. Dry matter, pH and other fermentation byproducts were also determined. The optimum temperature for the production of lactic acid was 30°C. Rate constants (k) were calculated by fitting each lactic acid curve to the Gompertz model and these were fitted to the Arrhenius equation and the energy of activation was calculated. An unusually low value for the energy of activation in biological systems was found (8300 ± 750 cal mol−1). The relatively high dry matter content (45% DM) in cassava silage could impose a type of barrier to diffusion of lactic acid. Local accumulation of lactic acid could affect the evolution of the biological reaction. Thus, this result could be explained by a diffusional limitation of lactic acid in the fermenting mass.

These effects were obtained, however, only in doses that also impaired motor execution. The purpose of the present study was to establish whether copulatory thrusting patterns were affected by these GABA transaminase inhibitors. Sodium valproate, 200 mg/kg, reduced the number of intromissions and the intromission rate without affecting mounting behavior. GAG, 100 mg/kg, had similar effects on sexual behavior. The only effect obtained on copulatory thrusting patterns was a small reduction in mount and intromission thrust frequency after GAG 100 mg/kg. It is unlikely that this effect is responsible for the inhibitory actions of GAG on sexual behavior, especially since sodium valproate did not modify copulatory thrusting patterns, but inhibited sexual behavior in a manner similar to that of GAG. © 1990.;Copulatory thrusting patterns | GABA transaminase inhibitors | Sexual behavior;13;0;;;;PCSABNA 030859;

A theoretical calculation based on the Ross equation showed that the water activity (aw) of the substrate decreased to 0.85 towards the end of the culture. Such low values were assumed to be inhibitory to growth. The aw of the substrate was increased when sugarcane bagasse was used as a high water retention capacity support. Higher growth rates and substrate conversion to biomass were obtained with this system, confirming that water availability is a critical factor in the SSF of starch substrates. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.;;102;0;;;;undefined;

The transition curves obtained from ellipticity changes at 208 and 220 nm were biphasic, i.e., they showed two distinct successive steps, demonstrating the existence of an intermediate state of stable secondary conformation in the denaturation process. Difference-spectroscopy studies indicated that considerable exposure of aromatic side-chains is involved in both steps of the transition. Since papain has two domains in its molecular structure, our results suggest that they unfold in a successive way and rather independently. Furthermore, the structural characteristics of the intermediate state, obtained from its circular dichroism spectrum in the far-ultraviolet region, seem to point out that the second domain (residues 111-212) is the most stable part of the molecule. © 1988.;Circular dichroism | Papain unfolding | Protein denaturation | Stable intermediate;34;0;;;;undefined;

No water samples caused inhibition of colonial growth rate, but in each experiment there were significant variations in other more sensitive responses. It is these variations that we have related to metal distributions, although of the metals measured, only copper and cadmium occasionally occur in concentrations that could be biologically significant, and at the same time show any correlation with the hydroid responses.

This technique permits the oscillographic recording of thrusting frequency, rhythmicity, and amplitude of the pelvic movements occurring during copulation. Castration resulted in a marked decrease in sexual activity in all rabbits. Mounting, including occasional intromissions, was retained by four of the rabbits for periods ranging from 2 to 15 weeks. Castration did not affect mount duration, but decreased strength and frequency of pelvic thrusting. Diminution in the frequency of pelvic thrusting was mainly due to intercalation of pauses within the mounting trains. The change in the rhythm of pelvic thrusting was related to the failure of most mounts performed by castrated rabbits to stimulate lordosis in the female. Testosterone propionate (TP, 10 mg daily for 15 days) restored mounting activity and increased strength and frequency of pelvic thrusting in all rabbits. It is concluded that TP, besides stimulating sexual motivation, regulates the vigor and rhythm of pelvic movements during copulation in the rabbit. © 1980, All rights reserved.;;21;0;;;;undefined;
